Greta Thunberg was seen with a placard that read "Stand with Gaza"

**New Delhi:**

Climate activist Greta Thunberg's support for Gaza has drawn a sharp response from Israel. On Friday, Greta posted a picture on X, formerly Twitter, in which four activists, including herself, held placards expressing solidarity with Palestine and Gaza.

Reacting to Ms Thunberg's post, Israel, through its official X handle, took a dig at the climate activist saying that Hamas doesn't use sustainable materials for their rockets, "which have butchered innocent Israelis".

"The victims of the Hamas massacre could have been your friends. Speak up,” the post added

Israel also used pictures of three 19-year-old Israelis, who were killed allegedly in a Hamas attack.

The response came after Ms Thunberg, in her post, was seen with a placard that read, "Stand with Gaza."

Another activist called for a "Free Palestine," while two other women held placards with messages, "This Jew supports Palestine" and "Climate justice now!"

“Week 270. Today we strike in solidarity with Palestine and Gaza. The world needs to speak up and call for an immediate ceasefire, justice and freedom for Palestinians and all civilians affected,” Greta Thunberg wrote in the caption.

Some users, however, came to Ms Thunberg's defense. They pointed out that her expression of support was for Gaza, not necessarily for Hamas. One user wrote, “Your subconscious and true ideals leaked. She said Gaza, not Hamas. This says a lot. good luck editing this next.”

Another person accused Israel of “playing the victim card.”

A user accused Israel of similar actions and brought up concerns about the environmental sustainability of the air and watercraft used by the IDF in the context of restricting movement and impacting Palestinians in the region. “The air and watercrafts used by the IDF to restrict movement and BUTCHER innocent Palestinians in the largest open-air prison for 75 years aren't made of sustainable materials,” read the comment.

Ms Thunberg's statement came 270 weeks after she initiated her Friday school strike, which later ignited the global school strikes movement.

The United Nations revealed that in just 10 days, around 4,200 people have lost their lives and more than a million people have been forced to leave their homes due to the Israel-Hamas war.

Greta Thunberg — from climate warrior to Israel hater

Greta Thunberg brought millions out onto the world’s streets to protest for a greener future. Demonstrating against companies polluting the planet in a variety of countries, she was arrested multiple times. Since Hamas’ brutal October 7 terrorist attack, the Swedish activist has redirected much of her rage toward Israel.

She wears a keffiyeh, poses with Palestinian flags and accuses Israel of "genocide," while largely ignoring Qatar, which, for years, has been transferring to Hamas funds derived from its oil and natural gas sales profits. Paradoxically, burning these fuels emits greenhouse gases, a contributing factor to global warming - the very issue Thunberg has been protesting for years.

At demonstrations, she calls to "Free Palestine," stop arming Israel and impose a permanent ceasefire on the country. She rarely, if ever, demands the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza or condemns the terrorist attack that triggered the war.

Demonstrating against Israel being her first priority, Thunberg didn’t even bother attending either the 2023 climate conference held in Dubai or that of 2024 in Baku, Azerbaijan. The climate activist has turned her back on her supporters, and alongside her relentless anti-Israel campaigning, has also sparked anger in other arenas.

Thunberg visited Turkey’s Kurdish regions last November, evoking outrage in the country for condemning Erdogan’s government. She criticized the environmental destruction in Kurdish-populated areas. "Destruction and exploitation of nature – such as unlawful forest cutdowns, sacrificing zones for mining companies and fires – is one of the many tools used as part of the continuous attacks against the Kurds. This often leads to devastation of local communities and biodiversity as well as forced displacement."

On an X posting, she then called on Turkey to amend its treatment of the Kurds. "Turkey must clarify its stance on the Kurds and other minority groups by enshrining their rights in the constitution." She went on to write, "The government continues to use ‘terrorism’ as a pretext to silence its political opponents. Tens of thousands of politically active individuals remain imprisoned without fair trials. International organizations such as the ECHR, UN, and Amnesty have condemned this and called for their release. For a sustainable peace and a just future, the Kurds’ right to freedom and autonomy must be respected and the violent attacks against Kurdistan must end."

After causing ire in Turkey, she moved on to voice her support for independence for Western Sahara, provoking fury in Morocco. She posed with the Western Sahara flag, championing the region’s struggle for justice and human rights. She said it was unacceptable for the international community to ignore the situation in Western Sahara and called for global action toward a just resolution.

This too is a political struggle, in no way related to climate issues. She’s also condemned the Azerbaijani government, accusing it of "ethnic cleansing" and further crimes against Armenians, and has protested against Georgia’s government, advocating "Justice, freedom and democracy," amid the country’s political crisis.

And if you’d thought Thunberg had given up on her anti-Israel activism, you’d be wrong. She continues posting images of Palestinian flags and protest signs in support of Gazans from her weekly demonstrations in Stockholm. Last month, she returned to Denmark, where she took part in a violent protest against the Maersk shipping company.

Along with further anti-Israel activists, Thunberg disrupted activity at the company’s headquarters, claiming it was using its ships to transport weapons to Israel. She called on the company to cancel all contracts and investments related to what she termed "Genocide and occupation of Palestine." Thunberg was arrested along with around two dozen more protesters who were all released shortly thereafter.

Meanwhile, she regularly shares anti-Israel messages urging her 14 million Instagram followers, and millions more on other social media platforms, to demonstrate and take action against Israel.

Thunberg is the daughter of actor Svante Thunberg and opera singer Malena Ernman who represented Sweden in Eurovision 2009. At age 15, in the summer of 2018, Greta started a one-woman protest outside the Swedish parliament. She would show up every Friday with a small sign reading, "Skolstrejk för klimatet" (School Strike for Climate) She was slowly but surely joined by more teenagers and, in time, mobilized masses worldwide to take to the streets to protest the climate crisis. She met with numerous world leaders and took part in demonstrations across the globe.

Her protest peaked the following September with millions of young people flooding the streets of major cities worldwide and staging climate marches. Thunberg led hundreds of thousands in a climate demonstration in New York City, making the journey to America by solar-powered boat, averting the greenhouse gas emissions of a transatlantic flight.

That same month, Thunberg even expressed solidarity with Israel, tweeting a photo of climate supporters in Tel Aviv - only to be met with backlash. Despite talk backers angrily asking, "How dare you?”, she left up the posting.

Greta Thunberg on the cover of Time Magazine

Thunberg was named Time Magazine's 2019 Person of the Year. Then - and current - US President Donald Trump, whom Thunberg had stared down at the UN building in New York, mocked her, tweeting, "Greta must work on her Anger Management problem, then go to a good old-fashioned movie with a friend! Chill Greta, Chill!"

Thunberg has even received several Nobel Peace Prize nominations for her climate activism. The committee went for other candidates.

Israeli social media users also expressed their indignation, arguing that her statements essentially amounted to support for Hamas. One user, "@hasolidit," remarked: "Autistic children were murdered by Hamas and singled out as legitimate military targets solely because they were Israeli Jews. Your failure to even acknowledge that is proof of your rabid antisemitism. Not your stupid stuffed animal," referring to a toy octopus appearing in one of Thunberg’s posts, interpreted by some as an antisemitic symbol.

Thunberg didn’t stop at anti-Israel posts, but rather brought her anti-Israel activism to her weekly protests outside the Swedish parliament. Three weeks following the massacre, the Swedish activist stood alongside anti-Israel placards declaring, "Free Palestine," and, "Stop the Holocaust," and she herself held a sign reading, "Justice for Palestine."

> Many argue that Thunberg’s political stance is damaging the crucial fight against climate change

Criticism of Thunberg has also emerged on the global stage with Fridays for Future (FFF) leaders in Germany, Austria, and even in her homeland of Sweden, distancing themselves from her October 20 post featuring signs supporting the Palestinians, while ignoring the Hamas massacre. Israeli teens have also lashed out at Thunberg, turning her from a role model to a resented figure.

Thunberg’s controversial stance has meant the global climate movement, which had enjoyed widespread consensus support, has found itself divided around a conflict many of its advocates don’t understand, and certainly has nothing to do with environmentalism.

Thunberg has become fixated on the Palestinian issue. At rallies, rather than talking about global warming, the climate crisis, pollution killing millions every year, or countries (such as Iran, Iraq, and Qatar) still producing oil, she has repeatedly spoken out against Israel.

At a rally in Amsterdam November 2023, a man approached her on stage and said that he had come to an environmental, not political, event. The man was forcibly removed from the stage as Thunberg declared to the crowd, "No climate justice on occupied land."

Palestinian flags were waved in the crowd and Thunberg was spotted donning a keffiyeh. In an effort to clarify her stance, she said, “As a climate justice movement, we have to listen to the voices of those who are being oppressed and those who are fighting for freedom and for justice. Otherwise, there can be no climate justice without international solidarity.” She, again, in no way addressed the Hamas terrorist attack that sparked the war. Why? Maybe, it was convenient for her to overlook the murderous attack so as to stand alongside Gazan civilians, some of whom, as it turns out, assisted the terrorists, hiding hostages in their homes or concealing weapons and terrorists.

Amsterdam wasn’t the end of it. Thunberg continued her scathing anti-Israel rhetoric, undoubtedly to the delight of Tehran, Doha, and Hamas leaders in hiding. At a pro-Palestinian in Stockholm in November 2023, she called to "Crush Zionism."

Throughout this time, she carried on wearing a keffiyeh around her neck, posing with anti-Israel protest signs and Palestinian flags and accusing Israel of "genocide" in Gaza. In Malmo, Sweden, last May, she showed up at the Eurovision Song Contest, an event officially defined as non-political. Here, she took part in a protest and was arrested for disturbing the peace. Photos from the scene showed her, with a keffiyeh wrapped around her neck, being dragged away by two police officers. At this demonstration, Palestinian flags were waved and slogans were chanted against Israel and then President Joe Biden. She was arrested once more a few months later, this time in Copenhagen, again at an anti-Israel rally,

Many argue that Thunberg’s political stance is damaging the crucial fight against climate change. The young woman who once drew millions globally against corporations polluting the environment and fought for a better future has now abandoned the cause she spearheaded. Her role has shifted from that of a leader enjoying global consensus to a divisive figure, ignoring the crimes of Hamas terrorists who raped, murdered and kidnapped Israelis on October 7.

The past 18 months have witnessed almost no large-scale demonstrations against climate change, but rather modest protests numbering in the dozens or hundreds. Trump is back in the White House and, unlike during his previous term of office, when climate activists under Thunberg’s leadership were taking to the streets en masse, the U.S. president’s anti-environment measures are passing rather quietly as world leaders are acting slowly if at all. And it looks like no one can lead the global climate protest like the old Greta Thunberg could.

Greta stands with Gaza
======================

![](data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%201%201'%2F%3E)

Greta Thunberg's 'stand with Gaza' is a historic moment for the global climate movement.

> .

Greta Thunberg posted the picture below on her X account during a week of climate and peace protests in London recently. Many people in the press criticised her because they themselves supported the Israeli bombing and opposed a ceasefire. 

_Medical Aid for Palestinians is responding to the current emergency in Gaza. It has launched an emergency appeal to 'ensure that Palestinian health workers have the medical resources they need, as soon as possible'. You can donate to the appeal_ [_online_](https://www.map.org.uk/donate/donation-details/484)
_._ 

Some of those people called her, ludicrously, antisemitic, because a toy octopus appeared in the first image she used. There was also criticism from some climate activists in Germany, Austria and Israel. Beyond that, there was little open criticism from the climate movement, and much support on social media.

This is a historic moment for the global climate movement. This article explains why. The photo reminded us of Martin Luther King’s speech on the Vietnam War at the Riverside Church in Manhattan on 4 April 1967. 

**Questions**

King had maintained a public silence on the war for the two years after President Johnson sent 500,000 troops to Vietnam. Now he broke that silence to call for peace and American withdrawal.

_Nancy and Jonathan have recently published_ Why Men? A Global History of Violence and Inequality _(Hurst, 2023)._ [_Order a copy now_](https://www.hurstpublishers.com/book/why-men/)
_._

Many of his advisers, and many liberals had urged him not to speak out, saying that it would split the civil rights movement and turn President Johnson’s government against them.

King went ahead. In an eloquent and closely argued speech, he said that he had been urging nonviolence on young African Americans rioters. They had replied to him with a question: What about Vietnam?  

"Their questions hit home, and I knew that I could never again raise my voice against the violence of the oppressed in the ghettos without having first spoken clearly to the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today—my own government.

"For the sake of those boys, for the sake of this government, for the sake of the hundreds of thousands trembling under our violence, I cannot be silent."

**Greatest**

King’s courage strengthened opposition to the war, particularly among Black Americans, and especially among Black American soldiers. But the effect of his words went far wider as well.

King also told the truth – the war was racist. And it was the same racism that characterised American society. And by telling the truth King saved his own integrity.

Greta's speaking style is very different from King’s. He was the greatest rhetorical speaker in America in the twentieth century. He reached for the strongest effects, for metaphors and the rolling rhythms of Southern preachers and gospel music.

Greta is a master of plain speech. Her longest speeches are short, clear and passionate. Her X posts are compact, honest, devastating. And in this picture there are only twelve words. But together they carry a complex argument.

![](/sites/default/files/inline-images/greta-gaza-2%20%281%29_0.jpg)

Each face tells a story, and each tells a different story.

**Radical**

Look again at the four young women. Greta holds a sign that says “Stand With Gaza”. Because she is instantly recognizable, the most important leader in the climate movement, this carries a message: The whole climate movement should support Palestine. 

It’s a call for change. And she is choosing her words carefully: Stand With Gaza. Not peace, not ceasefire - though she supports both. 

But no, solidarity is the starting point. Behind her another young woman holds two words: ‘Climate Justice Now’. She is saying this is about climate. And this is about justice. 

As with King, we cannot talk about climate justice if we do not support the most important issue of social justice in the world right now. A third woman holds two words: “Free Palestine”.

They are written on a piece of paper, or cardboard, on which someone has painted the colours of the Palestinian flag. Again, that means peace, but far more. This is an intervention on the radical side of the issue.

**Moral**

The fourth woman has five words: “This Jew Stands With Palestine.” Our solidarity is not antisemitism. Take a moment to look at those expressions again.

This picture, these four women, are a response to a moral imperative. This is a response to a unfolding great atrocity. That is the most important matter here, and that is enough. But this solidarity is also historically important for the climate movement. Here is why.

This is a change. All through the days of the mass school strikes, Greta insisted that the movement had to be non-political. For example, she refused to support a Green New Deal because it would split the movement. She did not then comment on matters beyond climate.

This made sense to her, as it made sense to many people in the climate movement. And on some level, she may still have hoped against hope for action by the politicians. Then two things happened. 

First, in October 2019 Thunberg called for adults to join the school students on strike. She said that if they did not, the students could not win. Large numbers of trade unionists did strike in Germany and Australia, but nowhere else.

**Conclusion**

The conclusion was clear. Greater power was needed. Only a global movement for social justice in all its forms could deliver that. The other conclusion was that the leaders of the world would not act. Form the UN climate talks in Glasgow in 2021 she sent two tweets that condensed the argument. 

One was “Blah, blah, blah. F\*\*\* you.” The other was “Uproot the system”. Gaza matters because of seventy-five years of suffering, and because human beings, children, women and men are dying there in great numbers.

But those are not the only reasons why so many people have marched in solidarity in so many countries. This is also a great public racist massacre. This is the racism of centuries of white supremacy made murderous flesh again.

People know this, all over the world. It is why African Americans and people of colour are so central to the marches in the United States, and why all the thirteen representatives in the US Congress who have called for a ceasefire are people of colour.

Most people in Africa, Asia and Latin America know this too. But so do many, many white people in Europe and North America. So do people in the Middle East, acutely, in their guts, enraged and in sorrow. And so, as we have seen, do many Jewish people in New York, Washington and Tel Aviv.

**Future**

This is why the movement has been so enormous. We want to rid the world of racism and we are saying every human matters. The scale of these movements has frightened the governments of the world. That is why the secretary general of the United Nations and most of the governments of the world have called for a ceasefire.

This is where the future of Palestine, the future of the climate movement and the future of humanity come together. For one thing, climate change will bring us many massacres like Gaza's, many punishments of refugee camps. 

Runaway climate change will cover the world with walls, camps, barbed wire, hungry refugees and government massacres. The fight against such a future starts now. But there’s more. Pakistan has at least housed many refugees for decades. 

Almost all of Europe is far worse, and there hatred of refugees fuels racism and a turn to the far right. But also, we know by now that we cannot stop climate change without a massive, committed climate movement across the world, willing to take power to save us all.  

We cannot do that without the active support of the majority of workers and peasants in Africa, Latin America and Asia. There are many reasons. The people in the poorer countries of the Global South are 80 per cent of humanity. 

**Horror**

Back in 2019 those countries already produced 62 per cent of global fossil fuel emissions. Soon enough they will produce two-thirds. That means we cannot stop climate change unless the people in those countries insist upon an economy that brings them a decent standard of living through renewable energy.

Moreover, the great social movements of the last hundred century strongest, and most important in the countries of the Global South. After all, that is where people have suffered most. 

And since the Arab Spring, and all the great movements against dictatorship, the social movements have again been strongest in the South. And the impact, the horror, of climate change will be worst in the South. 

The movements in Europe and North America still matter. We write this in England, and Thunberg made that photo in Sweden. And people in the South will not stop climate change if the North refuses to do so. 

**Turning**

We are all in this together. But what happens in the South will matter more. That is why standing with Gaza against racism matters for the future of the climate movement. But there is another link. To stand with Gaza is to stand with life against death. 

To stand against climate change is to do the same on a far larger scale. This photo, just a photo, is a moment in human history. By contrast, Gaza is the most important issue in the world right now. 

But this is also a turning point in the climate movement. There will be many more horrors. We are embarked on the mother of all struggles to save each other and all living things. 

There will be many more such moments, and some of them will be even worse. But the direction of change for the climate movement is becoming clear. Like the signs say: stand with Gaza - climate justice now!.

Content: "Climate activist Greta Thunberg was filmed giggling as she declared “f–k Germany” and “f–k Israel” at an anti-Israel rally in Germany Friday, video shows.

The 21-year-old appeared as a speaker at the demonstration in the southwestern German city of Mannheim, which included a discussion focused on “solidarity with Palestine and the climate movement.”

“F–k Germany,” [Thunberg says in the clip](https://x.com/StopAntisemites/status/1865513089656840246)
, before bursting into laughter. “And f–k Israel,” she adds to rapturous applause and whistling from the crowd.

A city spokesperson [told German news agency Deutsche Presse-Agentur](https://www.yahoo.com/news/greta-thunberg-attends-pro-palestine-062727591.html)
 that 700 protesters attended the rally, which they described as peaceful.

Thunberg, however, has faced fierce backlash for the comments since the clip was shared on social media.

Manuel Hagel, a conservative leader in a regional parliament, slammed the inflammatory language, [the Jerusalem Post](https://www.jpost.com/diaspora/article-832423)
 reported.

“Mannheim does not need a platform for such dehumanizing positions and our country does not need the presence of people like Greta Thunberg,” Hagel seethed, according to the outlet.

Advocacy group StopAntisemitism blasted the young activist as a “Hamas shill” in a post that had been viewed more than 70,000 times on X early Monday afternoon.

“Climate activist turned Hamas shill Greta Thunberg has made her stance crystal clear… someone should remind Greta that Israel is a global leader in solving climate challenges,” the group wrote.

 [!Thunberg speaking behind podium <image:393> 3](# "Open a slideshow of all 3 article images.")

The rally was a peaceful gathering of 700 people, according to city officials. The climate activist [was named “Antisemite of the Week” by StopAntisemitism](https://nypost.com/2024/09/15/us-news/greta-thunberg-named-antisemite-of-the-week-by-jewish-advocacy-group/)
 following her arrest at a rally in September — and is in the running for the group’s “Antisemite of the Year.”

Thunberg was arrested on Sept. 4 while protesting with the group Students Against the Occupation, which called on Copenhagen University to cease all connections with Israel, including putting an end to several cross-university student programs.

She posted a photo of herself holding a sign reading “Stand with Gaza” just days after Oct. 7, alongside a toy octopus — which some read as an allusion to the Nazis’ antisemitic propaganda visualizing Judaism’s supposed network of control over the world.

Thunberg, who is on the autism spectrum, later removed the photo and [claimed she was “completely unaware”](https://nypost.com/2023/10/20/greta-thunberg-posts-pro-palestinian-pic-with-antisemitic-trope/)
 of the historical use of antisemitic octopus imagery and clarified that she meant for it to represent her emotions.

“The toy in the picture is a tool often used by autistic people as a way to communicate feelings,” she said. Getty Images

A slew of Jewish state supporters also took to X to ask, “Why has she ever been relevant?” and called the incident “nasty.”

“She’s lost the plot entirely,” one critic declared.

This wouldn’t be the first time Thunberg has come under fire for hateful comments. <image:394> 3](# "Open a slideshow of all 3 article images.")

Thunberg has faced backlash since October 7, when she began openly supporting the Palestinians."

[Greta Thunberg](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/02/03/greta-thunberg-ruffian-masquerading-as-latter-day-saint/)
 has been accused of being a “Hamas shill” after footage of the [climate change activist](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/05/12/queen-greta-has-exposed-the-truth-about-the-green-movement/)
 declaring “f--- Israel” at a rally emerged.

Ms Thunberg, 21, was speaking during a discussion on “solidarity with [Palestine](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/12/04/giant-anti-israel-banner-unfurled-outside-parliament/)
 and the climate movement” at a demonstration in the German city of Mannheim on Friday.

“F--- Germany,” Ms Thunberg said in the clip before laughing. “[And f--- Israel](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2023/10/27/greta-thunbergs-climate-movement-demonises-israel/)
,” she added, as the crowd applauded.

The footage has been widely shared online and has led to fierce criticism of Ms Thunberg.

Manuel Hagel, a centre-Right member of the local state parliament, said she was “moving very consciously in close proximity to anti-Semitism”.

“Mannheim does not need a platform for such dehumanising positions and our country does not need the presence of people like Greta Thunberg,” the CDU lawmaker told the Jerusalem Post.

A spokesman for the city said more than 700 people attended the peaceful demonstration.

StopAntisemitism, an American campaign group, wrote in a social media post, viewed over 73,000 times: “Climate activist turned Hamas shill Greta Thunberg has made her stance crystal clear.

“Someone should remind Greta that Israel is a global leader in solving the climate challenge.”

The group has put Ms Thunberg in the running for its “anti-Semite of the year” award, which is open to public vote.

The [Greta Thunberg Foundation](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/politics/greta-thunberg-16-year-old-activist-every-leader-planet-wants/)
 was asked for comment but did not immediately respond.

Germany is one of Israel’s staunchest supporters in Europe, which is a legacy of the Holocaust under the Nazi regime.

The German branch of the Fridays for Future climate movement, which began after the then 15-year-old Ms Thunberg’s school strikes protests, has already distanced itself from the Swedish activist.

It came after Ms Thunberg spoke at a climate protest in Amsterdam in November last year. But that does not justify disinformation.”

Ms Thunberg, who is Swedish, was arrested on Sept 4 while protesting with a group calling on Copenhagen University to cut all ties with Israel.

Days after the October 7 terror attacks, she posted a photo of herself holding a sign reading “Stand with Gaza”.

Ms Thunberg, who is autistic, was pictured with a toy octopus, which some interpreted as a reference to Nazi propaganda accusing Jews of controlling the world.

“The toy in the picture is a tool often used by autistic people as a way to communicate feelings,” Ms Thunberg said, after insisting she was “completely unaware” of the historical use of octopus imagery in anti-Semitic propaganda. Wearing a Palestinian black and white scarf, she urged “ceasefire now”.

Luisa Neubauer, the head of the German chapter of the Fridays for Future movement, said at the time: “It is obvious that for many global organisations, global realities diverge when it comes to Israel and Palestine."

===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that Greta Thunberg did express the phrase "f–k Israel" at a rally. However, the claim states that she held a sign with the phrase written on it. The reverse image search did not find the exact image in the claim, but it did find articles discussing Thunberg's support for Gaza and anti-Israel activism. The web search found that Thunberg said the phrase at a rally in Germany.

The claim is partially supported by the evidence, as Thunberg did use the phrase. However, the evidence does not confirm that she held a sign with the phrase written on it.

CNN  — 

Former President [Donald Trump](https://www.cnn.com/politics/president-donald-trump-45)
 met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday, the first such meeting between the two men since Trump left the White House more than three years ago.

The meeting at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence was requested by Netanyahu, sources familiar with the planning told CNN. Harris, now the presumptive Democratic nominee, [conveyed a forcefulness](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/25/politics/harris-netanyahu-israel-hamas-ceasefire/index.html)
 on civilian suffering and ending the war following her time with the prime minister.

Netanyahu said Friday that he hoped Harris’ comments would not make a ceasefire deal harder to reach.

“I think to the extent that Hamas understands there’s no daylight between Israel and the United States, that expedites the deal,” said Netanyahu to reporters at his meeting with Trump. I actually don’t know how a person who is Jewish could vote for her, but that’s up to them.”

Ahead of Netanyahu’s remarks, [Harris’ office rejected on Friday](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/26/politics/harris-team-netanyahu-meeting-reaction/index.html)
 the suggestion originally from a senior Israeli official that the [vice president’s remarks](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/25/politics/harris-netanyahu-israel-hamas-ceasefire/index.html)
 could have made [a ceasefire deal](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/25/politics/biden-netanyahu-meeting/index.html)
 harder to reach.

“I don’t know what they’re talking about,” a Harris aide told CNN, in response to a senior Israeli official being quoted in [The Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/harris-i-wont-stay-silent-on-gaza-suffering-israel-charges-shes-harming-deal-chances/)
.

“President Biden and Vice President Harris delivered the same message in their private meetings to Prime Minister Netanyahu: it is time to get the ceasefire and hostage deal done,” the aide to the vice president told reporters, adding that Harris’ meeting with Netanyahu was “serious and collegial.”

Trump elaborated on his own meeting with Netanyahu while continuing to slam Harris during a speech in West Palm Beach, Florida, on Friday night.

“She doesn’t like Jewish people. However, their relationship has soured in recent years, and the former president has been reluctant to speak with him throughout the ongoing conflict.

In the immediate aftermath of Hamas’ attack on Israel, Trump criticized Netanyahu for his handling of the war, claiming to Fox News at the time the prime minister and the country overall were “unprepared.”

Part of that criticism, which Trump has continued in the months since, stems from his complicated relationship with Netanyahu, one that a former Trump administration official described as “a love-hate relationship,” who added that the two leaders experienced a dramatic up and down in recent years.

During his administration Trump enacted multiple policies to Israel’s benefit, including moving the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, recognizing Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights and backing multiple countries in Middle East and North Africa to normalize relations with Israel as part of the Abraham Accords. The letter was sent after the assassination attempt on the 2024 Republican presidential nominee.

“Looking forward to seeing Bibi Netanyahu on Friday, and even more forward to achieving Peace in the Middle East!” Trump posted to Truth Social with the letter.

In posting that engagement with Abbas, Trump was trying to “strike a balance” going into the meeting, Bahbah said, adding that he hopes Trump will come out of the Netanyahu meeting calling for an immediate and permanent ceasefire.

Jewish supporters of Trump are hoping the former president asks Netanyahu what he needs to win the ongoing war, explained Lee Zeldin, a Jewish Republican and Trump supporter.

“At the table, the most important question is asking the prime minister what he needs to win. CNN Chief Legal Affairs Correspondent Paula Reid has the details.](https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/video-blanche-maxwell-split-digvid.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_250,c_fill)

Harris, Trump condemn pro-Hamas protest near US Capitol

Print

The two leading U.S. President Joe Biden meeting's with Netanyahu in Washington, July 25, 2024.

In her statement, Harris concluded, "I support the right to peacefully protest, but let's be clear: Antisemitism, hate and violence of any kind have no place in our nation."

In the first days of her presidential campaign against Republican Trump, Harris held a campaign rally with a teachers' union in the southwestern state of Texas on Thursday before flying to Washington to meet with Netanyahu at the White House. You had a horrible invasion that took place that would have never happened if I was president."

After Wednesday's protests, Trump called for Israel to quickly end the war and said the country was "not good" at promoting its cause in world affairs.

"You got to get it done quickly," Trump told Fox News.

Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, on Thursday condemned the most visible of the pro-Hamas protests against Israel that erupted the day before near the U.S. flag.

On his Truth Social media platform, Trump said "If those people rioting in Washington yesterday were Republicans/Conservatives, they'd all be in jail right now, facing 10- to 20-year sentences. President Joe Biden meeting's with Netanyahu in Washington, July 25, 2024. Capitol.

The protests came as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was defiantly defending his country's war against the Hamas militants in an address to Congress.

Harris, the likely Democratic presidential nominee in the 2024 election, said in a statement, "We saw despicable acts by unpatriotic protesters and dangerous hate-fueled rhetoric" at Union Station, Washington's train depot not far from the Capitol.

In the plaza in front of the rail station, demonstrators replaced American flags with Palestinian flags, and a man climbed up to the middle of a fountain and used red spray paint to write "Hamas is comin'" in big letters. officials, condemned the October 7 Hamas terror attack on Israel that killed about 1,200 people and led to the capture of about 250 hostages.

But as the months of fighting have raged on, and Israel's counteroffensive in Gaza targeting Hamas fighters killed more Palestinian civilians, especially thousands of women and children, Harris became more outspoken, initially blunter than Biden, about the need to end the conflict.

In March, she called for an "immediate" pause in fighting, contending that Israel had not done enough to ease a "humanitarian catastrophe" among Palestinians in Gaza.

"People in Gaza are starving," she said. That's who Kamala Harris is."

Trump, after remaining mostly silent about the Israel-Hamas war, in March told Israel it has "to finish the problem."

The Israeli leader visited Washington as his military’s airstrikes in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis added dozens of deaths to a mounting toll of 39,000, according to Gaza health authorities in the Hamas-controlled territory.

Additionally, [news](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-declares-two-more-gaza-hostages-dead-2024-07-22/)

Harris’s office did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday.

Both Biden and Harris are expected to meet Netanyahu separately on Thursday, followed by a joint meeting with the families of American hostages still held by Hamas.

“The leaders will discuss developments in Gaza and progress towards a ceasefire and hostage release deal and the United States’ ironclad commitment to Israel’s security, including countering Iran’s threats to Israel and the broader region,” according to a statement released Wednesday by White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre.

The Republican National Committee pounced on Harris’s absence in a statement, calling it “disgraceful snub” and accusing the vice president of being “weak” on Israel.

```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
On July 26, 2024, CNN reported on a meeting between Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at Mar-a-Lago, mentioning Trump's Truth Social posts about the meeting (<image:k>). On July 25, 2024, Voice of America reported that Trump posted on Truth Social, condemning pro-Hamas protests near the U.S. Capitol, but did not include the quote from the claim (<image:5352>).

The Tennessee Lookout reported on July 25, 2024, that Trump said on Truth Social he would welcome Netanyahu to Mar-a-Lago on Friday (<image:5354>, <image:5357>).

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Donald Trump posted on Truth Social on July 25, 2024. However, none of the provided sources mention the quote from the claim. The Voice of America article mentions a post condemning pro-Hamas protests, and the Tennessee Lookout reported on Trump welcoming Netanyahu to Mar-a-Lago.

The CNN article mentions Trump's Truth Social posts about the meeting with Netanyahu, but it does not include the quote from the claim.

Therefore, the evidence does not support the claim that Trump posted the specific quote on Truth Social on July 25, 2024.


## Final Judgement
The search results confirm that Donald Trump posted on Truth Social on July 25, 2024, but none of the provided sources contain the quote from the claim.

`false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is false. While Donald Trump did post on Truth Social on July 25, 2024, as reported by sources like [Voice of America](https://www.voanews.com/a/harris-trump-condemn-pro-hamas-protest-near-us-capitol/7713095.html) and the [Tennessee Lookout](https://tennesseelookout.com/2024/07/25/in-capitol-address-israeli-leader-calls-for-u-s-backing-to-defeat-hamas/), none of the provided evidence supports the specific quote attributed to him in the claim.

Do you think your partners -- can you get the Abraham Accords going again and get your partners, like UAE, Bahrain, and possibly Saudi to help you, and Egypt, to help you in Gaza if you're president again to build it the right way and get rid of the fanatics?

Well, Nixon met with Mao, who was the greatest murderer of the 20th century, because they had nukes. He met with Brezhnev.

Former President Donald J. Trump’s strong support for Israel has been central to his campaign, highlighting past achievements like relocating the US Embassy to Jerusalem, recognizing Israeli sovereignty on the Golan Heights, and brokering the Abraham Accords, but polls show that reoccupation of the Gaza Strip would be a far less popular policy among Israelis and American supporters of the Jewish state.

In the interview, Hewitt asked Trump if Gaza could be transformed into a prosperous area like Monaco. The remark came during a conversation with conservative host Hugh Hewitt on Monday, which marked the anniversary of the October 7 attacks by Hamas. Trump, the Republican nominee in this year’s US presidential election, claimed in a recent radio interview that he had visited Gaza, a war-torn region he has never officially been recorded visiting. When asked for clarification, a campaign aide asserted that Gaza is “in Israel” and noted that Trump had visited Israel.

The Gaza Strip, under Hamas control since 2007, is not claimed by Israel, though it was under Israeli military administration from 1967 to 2005. Despite some Israeli calls for its annexation, Gaza remains distinct, separated from Israel and the West Bank. Trump responded, “It could be better than Monaco. You know when—I’ve been there, and it’s rough.”

The Gaza Strip is not part of Israel and has never been, though some Israelis have called for annexing it. In 2007, after Hamas took over Gaza, Israel and Egypt imposed a blockade that restricted access to the area.

There is no record of Mr. Trump ever being in Gaza, during his time as president or as a businessman. Trump visited Israel and traveled to the West Bank — a separate territory that is some 20 miles from Gaza at the nearest point — for a meeting with the president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, in Bethlehem.

The attacks on Tuesday and Wednesday, September 17 and 18, in Lebanon with exploding walkie-talkies and [pagers](/en/exploding-hezbollah-pagers-how-did-it-happen/a-70250960)
 apparently targeted members of [Hezbollah](/en/hezbollah/t-41508807)
. The Iran-backed political party and militant group holds Israel responsible for the [strikes that killed at least 29 persons and injured around 2,800 people](/en/lebanon-explosions-stoke-fear-of-hezbollah-retaliation/a-70261978)
.

In the aftermath of the explosions a lot of fake images, videos and claims have been spreading online claiming to show the incidents.

DW's [fact checking team](/en/fact-check/t-56584214)
 checked three viral claims.

Are iPhones exploding in Lebanon as well?
-----------------------------------------

**Claim:** "An iPhone was also blown up in Lebanon", [a social media user wrote on X](https://archive.ph/yYA3i "External link — a social media user wrote on X")
 (formerly Twitter) sharing an image of a destroyed iPhone with more than 800.000 views.

**DW Fact check:** False.

This image of a destroyed iphone is not related to the current attacks in LebanonImage: X

A reverse image search reveals that this image is old and has nothing to do with the current incidents in Lebanon. The image of the exploded iPhone dates back [to March 2021](https://www.cairo24.com/1166674 "External link — to March 2021")
 when Egyptian news outlet Cairo24 reported an iPhone explosion in Maadi, Cairo. The incident caused a fire and injured a child.

Did exploding solar panels hurt more than 500 individuals?
----------------------------------------------------------

**Claim:** Other social media users insinuated that Israel had caused solar panels to burst into flames. "Lebanon: Sabotaged solar panels have started significant electrical fires. Over 500 individuals have been reported injured so far", [this user wrote](https://archive.ph/rkYv2 "External link — this user wrote")
 featuring an Israeli flag. Attached was an image of burning solar panels and a house on fire.

**DW Fact check:** False.

This claim about burning solar panels in Lebanon is false as wellImage: X

There are no documented cases of exploding solar panels in the current attacks in Lebanon. The image is a collage of two old pictures.

[Via a reverse image search](https://archive.ph/kp26N "External link — Via a reverse image search")

Did this laptop explode on September 19 in Lebanon?
---------------------------------------------------

**Claim:** "19-09-2024 – Explosion in Laptops”, a social media user wrote on X [posting a photo of a charred laptop](https://archive.ph/5axnH "External link — posting a photo of a charred laptop")
.

**DW Fact check:** False.

This image of a charred laptop does not have anything to do with the current explosions in LebanonImage: X

The user added "Mossad is unstoppable” blaming the Israeli secret service for the explosions of pagers, walkie-talkies and now laptops as well. So far, there is no evidence that Israel or Mossad is responsible for the attacks. Pagers and walkie-talkies indeed exploded killing and injuring people. But no reliable reports exist that laptops did, as well.

The shared image gives no evidence for something alike either. [A reverse image search](https://archive.ph/5H4Cy "External link — A reverse image search")
 shows that the image dates back to [at least 2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/lcljyb/just_got_my_hands_on_an_engineering_sample_3090/?rdt=64930 "External link — at least 2021")
 when it was posted on Reddit.

So far, only pagers and walkie-talkies exploded in Lebanon according to both regional and international news. While Hezbollah and Iran both hold Israel accountable for the explosions it's not confirmed who is responsible for the attacks.

On Wednesday, September 18, reports of a second wave of explosions began to come in from Lebanon, mostly from Beirut. Today, iPhones and other electronics were exploded.

As of 21:00, the Lebanese Ministry of Health reported 14 dead and 450 injured in the new wave of explosions. Later, the media reported at least 500 injured. Among them are several children and health workers. The attack again predominantly targeted members of «Hezbollah».

[https://itc.ua/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG\_7420.mp4](https://itc.ua/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_7420.mp4)

The video shows many explosions in the city.

In addition to the streets and public places, electrical appliances explode in apartments, houses and shops (about 60 cases), as well as cars (at least 15 cases). Among other things, funeral processions of «Hezbollah» officials killed in yesterday’s explosions were hit by the explosions.

An explosion during a funeral.

Among the explosive devices, the media name Apple iPhones and other smartphones, laptops, scooters and mopeds, walkie-talkies, solar panels, and even electronic locks and kitchen appliances. Many sources claim that this includes any device that has a battery.

Explosion in one of the apartments.

Hezbollah also exploded stationary and mobile communication stations «Hezbollah» in buildings and cars. The organization called on its members to get rid of electronics altogether. In crowded places, representatives of «Hezbollah» ordered everyone present to turn off their electronic devices.

There is currently no accurate information on whether the series of explosions in Lebanon has ended. Various sources reported two waves of explosions during the afternoon.

Israel’s Pager Attack Has Cooked More Than Just iPhone Sales in China
=====================================================================

![cs_opinion_img](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%2075%2020'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

The pager attack in Lebanon has triggered a trust crisis among Chinese consumers of Western-made electronic products, such as iPhone. In the view of Chinese strategist, Prof. Wang Xiangsui, this once again proves that Western-led economic globalization is only a stage in history, not the final destination.

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201%201'%3E%3C/svg%3E)The pager explosions have taken about 12 lives and injured around 3000 people on September 17  

Last week, the pager attack in Lebanon captured global attention. This form of attack not only triggered panic among the Lebanese people but also shook global confidence in economic globalization. This is because Israel has opened Pandora’s box of using civilian product supply chains for military objectives.

The remote-controlled explosions in Lebanon came in two waves. In the first wave, the devices targeted were primarily pagers used by Hezbollah members. According to The Washington Post and other Western media, the explosives were pre-installed in the batteries. But in the second wave, the explosions extended to everyday civilian items like mobile phones, laptops, cars, and even electric razors used in barbershops. Chinese media outlet Guancha reported that this is done by mixing batteries with remote-controlled detonators into ordinary batteries in the Lebanon market, which were then randomly installed into these devices during repairs.

This is almost akin to randomly poisoning a city’s water supply, resulting in widespread, uncontrollable collateral damage. At least 32 people, including two children, were killed and thousands more injured. In fact, it aligns closely with the United Nations General Assembly’s definition of terrorism, reaffirmed since 1994: “criminal acts intended to cause public fear.”

In the realm of global economics, this type of terrorism is causing an alarming effect on a conceptual level.

For example, on Twitter(X), a photo of an iPhone detonated in Lebanon has sparked widespread attention. And on Chinese social media Weibo, Phoenix News created a vote, asking related to trending news, do you believe iPhones’ batteries have security issues? — with 45.6% of 8121 respondents voting “yes.”

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201%201'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201%201'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

This incident has triggered a direct trust crisis among Chinese consumers toward Western electronic products. Three days after the pager attack, the iPhone 16 was launched in mainland China. Normally, consumers would have to queue at stores to get the latest iPhone, often paying scalpers extra. But this year, the iPhone was already being sold at a discount on e-commerce platforms.

On the other hand, Huawei saw a surge in support. This is because, in the Lebanese explosions, manufacturers from Taiwan island and Japan were unaware that their products had been converted into bombs, claiming that external agents or suppliers had tampered with them. Chinese consumers, recalling that U.S. sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction have prevented Huawei from sourcing parts from Western manufacturers, noted that Huawei has increased the localization of its supply chain. Many Chinese commentators argue that U.S. sanctions have, ironically, “de-risked” Huawei phones.

The term “de-risking” was originally popularized by Western media during Trump’s trade war with China. But as Israel’s actions escalate, it seems Western media have lost control of their narrative. After all, when the West imposed long-arm jurisdiction on Chinese smartphones, electric vehicles, and 5G suppliers, it claimed that its safety standards were high and its detection methods sophisticated. These claims only hold water if consumers believe in them, making such jurisdiction legitimate in democratic societies. Now, however, Israel’s covert actions have undermined that legitimacy. If Western countries and Taiwan authorities cannot prove that they can protect their supply chain from the Mossad, they will lose their authority to define “safety standards” in China and around the world.

This, in turn, offers a significant advantage to Chinese companies. Going forward, Huawei and other manufacturers will no longer need to promote compliance with EU or U.S. standards to endorse product quality. Instead, labels like “Produced according to Chinese standards” or “Entirely non-Western suppliers” could become new selling points. This signals a potential shift in consumer value judgments from a unipolar world dominated by Western standards to a multipolar world where “Chinese standards” compete in parallel. This could reshape the direction of economic globalization, introducing new dimensions and market entry rules.

In the past, China made extensive adjustments to its economic policies and production standards to meet the requirements of the World Trade Organization (WTO), particularly in food safety. However, during incidents like the Fukushima nuclear wastewater discharge and the COVID-19 pandemic, China’s technical standards for inspecting seafood and meat products were notably higher than those of Western countries. With global consumer health in mind, this raises the question: Is China now better positioned to set international food hygiene standards? And in other sectors where China has similarly higher standards, shouldn’t they also be adopted by the WTO?

Clearly, if Western countries are genuinely committed to promoting the cross-border flow of production factors—allowing each country to capitalize on its strengths within the global market—then when it comes to ensuring supply chain security and setting safety standards for certain products, China evidently has a comparative advantage, to lead a higher quality economic globalization.

If the global market is truly free, then perhaps it’s time to move beyond a globalization dominated by Western-developed countries and shift toward a multipolar globalization that better reflects the comparative advantages of all nations.

Other sources, such as ITC.ua ([https://itc.ua/en/news/not-just-pagers-iphones-laptops-electronic-locks-and-other-devices-exploded-in-lebanon-today/](https://itc.ua/en/news/not-just-pagers-iphones-laptops-electronic-locks-and-other-devices-exploded-in-lebanon-today/)) and The China Academy ([https://thechinaacademy.org/israels-pager-attack-has-cooked-western-led-globalization/](https://thechinaacademy.org/israels-pager-attack-has-cooked-western-led-globalization/)), also feature the image (<image:31>) and discuss the attacks, with the ITC.ua article including another image (<image:343>). These articles report that the attacks targeted electronic devices, including iPhones, and resulted in casualties.

On 23 September 2024, [Israel](/wiki/Israel "Israel")
 began a series of airstrikes in [Lebanon](/wiki/Lebanon "Lebanon")
 as part of the ongoing [Israel–Hezbollah conflict](/wiki/Israel%E2%80%93Hezbollah_conflict_(2023%E2%80%93present) "Israel–Hezbollah conflict (2023–present)")
 with an operation it code-named **Northern Arrows**.[\[a\]](#cite_note-4)
 Since then, Israel's attacks have killed over 800 people,[\[4\]](#cite_note-:03-5)
 injured more than 5,000,[\[1\]](#cite_note-attacks_kill_92-1)
[\[5\]](#cite_note-FRANCE242-6)
[\[6\]](#cite_note-7)
 and displaced hundreds of thousands of Lebanese civilians.[\[b\]](#cite_note-10)
 The attacks are the deadliest in Lebanon since the end of the [Lebanese Civil War](/wiki/Lebanese_Civil_War "Lebanese Civil War")
, and began five days after Israel performed a deadly [pager and walkie-talkie attack](/wiki/2024_Lebanon_pager_explosions "2024 Lebanon pager explosions")
 on devices intended for [Hezbollah](/wiki/Hezbollah "Hezbollah")
 members, and three days after Israel performed an [airstrike on an apartment complex](/wiki/Assassination_of_Ibrahim_Aqil "Assassination of Ibrahim Aqil")
 in [Beirut](/wiki/Beirut "Beirut")
 which killed [Redwan Force](/wiki/Redwan_Force "Redwan Force")
 commander [Ibrahim Aqil](/wiki/Ibrahim_Aqil "Ibrahim Aqil")
 as well as 54 others.[\[9\]](#cite_note-strikes_kill_492-11)
[\[10\]](#cite_note-12)

The deadliest day was 23 September, when Israeli attacks killed 558 people, including 50 children and 94 women.[\[11\]](#cite_note-13)
 Additionally, Israel hit 14 ambulances and fire engines, killing four emergency responders and wounding 16 other medics.[\[12\]](#cite_note-NYT_updates-14)
 The attacks caused chaos among Lebanese civilians, forming traffic jams as they attempted to flee.[\[9\]](#cite_note-strikes_kill_492-11)
 Hundreds of schools were converted into shelters,[\[13\]](#cite_note-15)
 where NGOs and volunteers worked to meet the needs of the displaced, as the Lebanese government struggled to provide adequate support.[\[12\]](#cite_note-NYT_updates-14)

CNN  — 

Israel launched an [intense barrage of airstrikes](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-09-24-24-intl-hnk/index.html)
 across swathes of Lebanon on Monday in what was the deadliest day for the country since at least the 2006 war fought between Israel and the powerful Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah.

Terror and despair gripped Lebanese residents as Israeli bombs killed more than 500 people, including women and children, and wounded more than 1,800 others, authorities said, as residents fled their homes desperate to reach safety.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country is changing the “balance of power” on its northern front as its military said it struck 1,600 Hezbollah assets across Lebanon on Monday, followed by more strikes the following day, and has not ruled out the possibility of a ground invasion.

On Tuesday, Hezbollah confirmed the death of one of its senior commanders, Ibrahim Qubaisi. A CNN team at a nearby hospital said they could hear sirens as first responders rushed to the scene.

Were civilians targeted?
------------------------

Israel said it was targeting Hezbollah infrastructure, but video shows destruction of residential areas and the large death toll reflects the scale and intensity of the strikes.

The nearly 500 killed on Monday alone is roughly half the number of Lebanese killed throughout the entire 34-day war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006.

Israeli warplanes were also seen flying over different parts of the country late afternoon, including over Mount Lebanon where Hezbollah does not have a notable presence.

Lebanon’s representative to the United Nations General Assembly said there was a mass “exodus” of people fleeing. Reuters video  from the southern suburbs of Beirut showed debris from damaged buildings and shards of glass littering the ground.

Lebanese Health Minister Firass Abiad said convoys of vehicles evacuating people from areas under fire had been “targeted,” as had two ambulances, a fire truck and a medical center. The attack was followed by an Israeli strike on a building in a densely populated southern Beirut, which killed at least 45 people including a top commander and other senior operatives, as well as women and children.

The following days saw some of the [most intense exchanges of fire](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-lebanon-attacks-09-22-24/index.html)
 between Israel and Hezbollah in almost a year of war in Gaza, as the Lebanese militant group fired projectiles deeper into Israeli territory than has previously been seen and Israel fired hundreds of projectiles into southern Lebanon.

It came as Israel made a new war objective to [return displaced residents to](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/lebanon-pagers-explode-hezbollah-israel-09-18-24-intl-hnk#h_daeba36f8733e65bb8fc317bb402aa5a)
 their homes near the northern border after being evacuated due to Hezbollah attacks.

On Monday, Netanyahu said Israel was changing the “security balance” of power in the north, and separately told the security cabinet the country’s aim in Lebanon is to cut “Hezbollah from the war with Hamas,” an Israeli official told CNN.

Though weakened militarily and its secretive lines of communication exposed, Hezbollah’s second-in-command has declared “a new chapter” in the confrontations which he called “a battle without limits.”

Are Lebanon and Israel at war?
------------------------------

While the airstrikes, attacks and rhetoric from both Israel and Hezbollah suggest they are in open conflict, neither side is calling the current escalation a war.

The head of Israel’s military Herzi Halevi said it is “preparing for the next phases” and Netanyahu in a televised speech told the people of Lebanon that his country is not at war with them, but with Hezbollah.

Iran has warned Israel of “dangerous consequences” following the strikes, with [Iran’s president telling CNN](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-09-24-24-intl-hnk#h_6235e84528435077b1e776d2156ad1be)
 on Monday that it risks tipping the region into wider conflict.

There is a renewed effort from the international community to de-escalate the situation. Qatar, one of the key mediators in talks between Israel and Hamas, said the region is on the “brink of the abyss” and France has requested an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council to address the strikes.

Former US Defense Secretary and ex-CIA chief Leon Panetta told CNN the situation has “crossed a threshold” and warned that “we’re clearly walking into a much wider war.”

.

The US believes that neither Israel nor Hezbollah are interested in a full-scale war, but a major concern is that Iran, a key backer of Hezbollah, will get involved, US officials told CNN.

What happened?
--------------

On Monday, Israel intensified its air campaign on Hezbollah, launching “extensive strikes” targeting the Iran-backed militant group in Lebanon. It is unclear how many of the casualties were civilians or Hezbollah militants, but many of the locations described by Israel as Hezbollah targets are also residential neighborhoods and villages.

Israel said that among the Hezbollah targets were “cruise missiles” that had a reach of hundreds of kilometers, rockets, and explosive warheads, according to military spokesperson Daniel Hagari, who claimed the munitions were stored in civilian homes.

Residents began to flee their homes after their phones began pinging with text [messages](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-09-23-24-intl-hnk#h_cca110f7f6c262429c395a8b4fd193a0)

A ceasefire has come into effect between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon after a deal was agreed to end 13 months of fighting.

In October 2023, Hezbollah began firing rockets at Israel in support of its ally Hamas in Gaza and Israel launched retaliatory air strikes in Lebanon.

The conflict escalated in late September 2024, when Israel launched an intense air campaign and ground invasion of southern Lebanon.

In Lebanon, more than 3,800 people have been killed since October 2023, according to Lebanese authorities, with one million people forced to flee their homes.

On the Israeli side, at least 82 soldiers and 47 civilians have been killed, while 60,000 people have been displaced, Israeli authorities say.

Map: Where is Lebanon?
----------------------

Lebanon is a small country with a population of about 5.5 million people, which borders Syria to the north and east, Israel to the south, and the Mediterranean Sea to the west. Israel’s prime minister insisted it would “maintain full freedom of military action” to attack Hezbollah if it violated the agreement.

Tens of thousands of Lebanese civilians displaced by the war have started returning to their homes in the south, despite being warned by the Israeli military that it was not safe to return to areas where its soldiers were still deployed.

Where were Israel's ground operations?
--------------------------------------

Israel launched its ground invasion of southern Lebanon on the night of 30 September 2024, with troops and tanks crossing the border in several locations.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it was carrying out "limited, localised, and targeted ground raids" to dismantle what it called Hezbollah's “terrorist infrastructure”.

Analysis by experts at the Institute for the Study of War suggests Israeli ground operations were limited to areas within a few kilometres of the border, as shown in the map below.

! <image:6454>

The IDF warned people living in dozens of towns and villages in southern Lebanon to leave their homes and head north of the Awali River, which meets the coast about 50km (30 miles) from the border with Israel.

Lebanese civilians were also told by the IDF not to use vehicles to travel south of the Litani River.

What did Israel’s air strikes target?
-------------------------------------

The IDF carried out air strikes in Lebanon throughout the conflict.

But it sharply escalated the air campaign on 23 September 2024, when it launched an operation targeting what it said were Hezbollah infrastructure sites and weapons in all areas of the country where the group has a strong presence.

However, Lebanese authorities say more than 700 women and 200 children have been killed since the start of the conflict, as well as another 200 people working in the country's health sector.

As the chart below shows, the intensity of the strikes stepped up significantly in the weeks before the Israeli ground invasion in late September and peaked in October.

The majority of Israeli strikes were in southern Lebanon, where about a million people lived before the conflict escalated over a year ago.

The map below - using analysis of satellite data by Corey Scher of CUNY Graduate Center and Jamon Van Den Hoek of Oregon State University - shows which areas of Lebanon sustained the most concentrated damage during the conflict.

Israel-Hezbollah conflict in maps: Ceasefire in effect in Lebanon
=================================================================

27 November 2024

What has been agreed in the ceasefire?
--------------------------------------

Under the terms of the ceasefire, Hezbollah must end its armed presence in the area of southern Lebanon between the Blue Line - the unofficial border between Lebanon and Israel - and the Litani River, about 30km (20 miles) to the north.

Over the next 60 days, Israel will gradually withdraw its forces from southern Lebanon and thousands of Lebanese army troops will move into the vacated positions in parallel, the agreement says.

The Lebanese army will ensure that Hezbollah's infrastructure or weaponry is removed and that it cannot be rebuilt, according to a senior US official.

! <image:6447>!Map of Lebanon showing areas where buildings have been damaged in the conflict since 5 April 2024. <image:6456>

As the following map shows, Beirut was also heavily targeted by Israeli air strikes.

There were some strikes close to central Beirut but the majority of them hit the southern suburbs of the city - densely populated areas that were home to hundreds of thousands of civilians.

These areas, close to the international airport, have a strong Hezbollah presence and it was a series of strikes on buildings there that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah on 27 September.

There were several dozens air strikes in the southern suburbs and central Beirut on 26 November hours before the ceasefire deal was agreed.

How does this fit in with wider Middle East conflict?
-----------------------------------------------------

Israel has a decades-long history of conflict with Hezbollah in Lebanon but it is just one of the fronts that it is currently engaged in hostilities.

The others include armed forces and non-state armed groups in several countries in the Middle East, including Iran, Syria and Iran-backed groups operating in Gaza, Iraq, Syria and Yemen.

_________________________



JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

Social media accounts posted [a photo](https://www.instagram.com/p/DISBVcfsfgU/)
 of two young children appearing as skeletons, claiming that the image shows two children found two months later under the rubble of their home in the Gaza Strip. The caption for the photo reads, “Two children found two months later under the rubble of their home.” Share, don’t just remain silent.

Kashif verified the image via Google Images search and found it to be old and the claim misleading. The image depicts two Spanish mummified children inside a museum in Bolivia, not two children found under rubble in the Gaza Strip.

The photo was posted on Fliker by an account named [Tanya Knigh on 25/12/2006, and was explained as showing two mummified Spanish children from the 19th century at the Mint Museum in Potosi, Bolivia.](https://www.flickr.com/photos/smurfie77/333238377?fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAaf-NowrYSPdQib6AwuqOgbujlriQwuln3oY-zG75oLRNBKRISpoXJq0vayn1A_aem_WdbZCYRlh2m7hO3aQi4zFQ)

Month-old girl pulled from rubble in Gaza after airstrike killed her parents
============================================================================

[World](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world)
 Mar 20, 2025 3:02 PM EDT

KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip (AP) — As rescuers dug through the remains of a collapsed apartment building in Gaza’s Khan Younis on Thursday, they could hear the cries of a baby from underneath the rubble.

Suddenly, calls of “God is great” rang out. Health officials said most of the victims were women and children.

The strike that destroyed the infant girl’s home hit Abasan al-Kabira, a village just outside of Khan Younis near the border with Israel, killing at least 16 people, mostly women and children, according to the nearby European Hospital, which received the dead.

It was inside an area the Israeli military ordered evacuated earlier this week, encompassing most of eastern Gaza.

Nabil Abu Dagga, a relative of Ella’s family who lives nearby, rushed to the scene of the strike.

“People were sitting together and enjoying themselves on a Ramadan night, staying up together as a family,” he said. The baby girl stirred fitfully as paramedics checked her over.

Her parents and brother were dead in the overnight Israeli airstrike.

“When we asked people, they said she is a month old and she has been under the rubble, since dawn,” said Hazen Attar, a civil defense first responder. We never felt that there was stability, not at all.”

Israel resumed heavy strikes across Gaza on Tuesday, shattering the truce that had facilitated the release of more than two dozen hostages. The military did not immediately comment on the overnight strikes.

Hours later, the Israeli military restored a blockade on northern Gaza, including Gaza City, that it had maintained for most of the war, but which had been lifted under the ceasefire deal.

Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians had returned to what remains of their homes in the north after a ceasefire took hold in January.

The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostage.

Israel’s blistering retaliatory air and ground offensive has killed nearly 49,000 Palestinians since then, more than half of them women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. She had been born 25 days earlier, in the midst of a tenuous ceasefire that many Palestinians in Gaza had hoped would mark the end of a war that has devastated the enclave, killed tens of thousands and displaced nearly its entire population.

Only the girl’s grandparents survived the attack. Killed were her brother, mother and father, along with another family that included a father and his seven children. Rescuers digging through the rubble could be seen pulling out the small body of a child sprawled on the mattress where he had been sleeping.

The girl’s grandmother, Fatima Abu Dagga, sat with a group of other women in a relative’s house Thursday, taking turns cradling the infant. Her sons and their wives and eight grandchildren died in the bombing, and only the baby survived."

Gaza: Baby pulled alive from rubble after Israeli air strike on Rafah
=====================================================================

Rescuers in the city of Rafah, southern Gaza, have pulled a baby girl alive from the rubble after an Israeli air strike.

People used their hands to free Mariam Abu Akel from the debris, before a rescuer ran with her to a nearby hospital.

Doctors there swabbed her cuts.

The baby had been sheltering in a house with her family when the strike took place, which killed her mother and sister, Reuters reported. Her father and young brother survived.

The air strike killed 20 people and injured 55, according to a Hamas-run health ministry spokesperson.

More than 21,500 people - mostly children and women - have been killed during Israeli retaliatory attacks on Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Thousands more are believed to be still under rubble of buildings destroyed by air and artillery strikes.

Israel launched its military campaign in Gaza after Hamas attacked southern Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people - most of them civilians - and taking about 240 hostages.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.

The Israeli air force targeted the western part of the city, amid the daily and escalating exchanges of fire between Hezbollah and the Israeli army along the Lebanese-Israeli border.

At least two missiles were fired at the two- or three-story building, according to security sources, residents, and rescuers whose testimonies were collected by our correspondent in the region.

On Thursday morning, Hussein Faqih, Head of the Civil Defence Centre in the Nabatieh Regional Centre, told L'Orient Today that the rescue operations in the destroyed building were concluded and that nine people suffered from injuries he qualified as "medium to light."

Others suffered from smoke inhalation caused by the explosions and loss of consciousness, according to Faqih.

The Civil Defense was deployed on-site, along with the Red Cross, al-Rissala scouts (affiliated with the Amal movement), and the Islamic Health Committee (affiliated with Hezbollah).

The building, located on an intersection in the northwestern area of Nabatieh called Hay al-Bayad, was completely destroyed, Faqih added, explaining that "dozens of close-by houses have been damaged, as well as dozens of cars."

According to our correspondent, Nabatieh had previously been targeted by drones, but never by the Israeli air force, which had, until now, targeted only the city’s outskirts.

Speaking to L'Orient Today, Iqbal Marwa, a supermarket owner in her fifties from the Al-Bayad neighborhood, said the balcony railings and doors in her house, just a few hundred meters from the airstrike, were shaking from the impact.

"I was on my balcony drinking coffee when I heard the sound of a missile being launched. Immediately after, I heard a huge explosion. Screams rose from the neighboring houses, and people went out onto their balconies, wondering where the explosion had occurred," she said.

"I did not expect my city to be bombed in this way. To be honest, I did not expect my house to be in the danger zone, yet I was not afraid," she said, ensuring that she intends to "stay in my home."

She explained she went to the site of the strike this morning and was "shocked by the extent of the destruction."

Faten Sabah, who was also close to the airstrike, told L'Orient Today that when she heard the sound of the fighter jets and "a sonic boom," she "took cover in a corner of the room and asked my daughter to take cover as well, fearing the windows would shatter."

"As soon as I said that, a massive explosion echoed for a few seconds, shaking the walls and doors."

"I will not leave my house because of one raid, and neither will my neighbors. This is what they said this morning. We agreed not to leave our homes and to monitor how the situation develops," Sabah said. She added sarcastically, "Where would we go with our pockets empty of money?"

In mid-February, notably, seven civilians from the same family were killed in a drone strike in Nabatieh. The Israeli army said the attack was conducted in retaliation for unclaimed rocket fire from Lebanon that hit a military base in northern Israel and killed one soldier.

### נגרם נזק לבית ביישוב אביבים, לא היו נפגעים

המועצה האזורית מרום הגליל: לפני זמן קצר נורה טיל לעבר בית פרטי ביישוב אביבים שבמועצה האזורית מרום הגליל. נגרם נזק לבית, לא היו נפגעים.

ראש המועצה האזורית מרום הגליל עמית סופר: "עוד בית שניזוק באביבים. היישוב חטף עד כה עשרות טילים מסוגים שונים והנזקים לרכוש הם בהיקפים גדולים ומשמעותיים כך גם יישובים סמוכים. כל מתקפה כזו משפיעה על כל היישובים שלא פונו. אני מקווה שמינוי הפרויקטור ייבשר את הזרמת התקציבים והמענים הכה דחופים בצפון"

ראש הממשלה קיבל סקירה ממפקד פיקוד הצפון אלוף אורי גורדין וממפקדי החטיבה והגדודים על עשיית לוחמי הצנחנים במילואים, שלקחו חלק בכל מלחמות ישראל ונלחמו מספר חודשים בדרום רצועת עזה. המפקדים הביעו באופן חד משמעי את נחישותם ומוכנותם להמשך לחימה עצימה בכל מרחב וזמן שידרשו לכך.

### גלנט בבית הלבן - בביקורת על נתניהו: "גם כאשר אנו חלוקים על הדרך, אנחנו פותרים זאת בחדרים הסגורים"

**שר הביטחון גלנט בבית הלבן: "המטרות והיעדים במלחמה משותפים לישראל וארה"ב, גם כאשר אנו חלוקים על הדרך אנחנו פותרים זאת בחדרים הסגורים - כעת אנחנו מסכמים את הדברים"**

שר הביטחון יואב גלנט נפגש כעת (רביעי) עם היועץ לביטחון לאומי של ארה"ב ג׳ייק סאליבן בבית הלבן. 

השר גלנט אמר בפתח הפגישה: "אני נכנס כעת לפגישה עם היועץ לביטחון לאומי ג'ייק סאליבן בבית הלבן, על מנת לדון כפי שידידים דנים בסדרה ארוכה של דברים - לבנון, עזה, איראן, הנושאים הקשורים אליהם וגם נושא האספקה האמריקאית לישראל״. 

״קיימתי כאן במהלך השבוע האחרון סדרה ארוכה של פגישות עם מזכיר ההגנה אוסטין, עם מזכיר המדינה בלינקן ועם רבים אחרים. הפגישות האלה חשובות מאוד וכעת אנחנו נמצאים בסיכומים של הדברים״. 

״יש לנו מטרות משותפות, יש לנו יעדים משותפים ולפעמים אנחנו גם חלוקים על הדרכים באשר להשיג אותם. את המחלוקות אנחנו פותרים בחדרים סגורים, בצורה משותפת וטוב שכך".

UN staff member killed in central Gaza blast, five others injured
=================================================================

19 March 2025 [Peace and Security](/en/news/topic/peace-and-security)

At least one UN staffer has been killed and at least five others injured – several very severely – following an explosion at two UN guesthouses in Deir al Balah in the central Gaza Strip on Wednesday.

The UN is verifying and confirming the details, including the circumstances that led up to the incident at the compound,, but **it was not due to “any action” that was being taken by UN personnel to remove “unexploded ordinance”**, the head of the [UN Office for Project Services](https://www.unops.org/)
 (UNOPS) [said](https://www.unops.org/news-and-stories/speeches/statement-on-unops-colleague-killed-at-unops-premises-in-gaza)
 during a press conference in Brussels.

According to media reports, the Israeli military – which has resumed deadly strikes in the Gaza Strip, killing hundreds since Monday – has denied attacking the compound.

“**These premises were well known by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and they were ‘deconflicted’**,” said, UNOPS chief Jorge Moreira da Silva, explaining that “**everyone knew who was working inside the premises – it was UN personnel, UNOPS personnel**.”

No accident
-----------

“This was not an accident, this was an incident,” he told journalists, adding that additional information is being collected.

“**What we do know is that an explosive ordnance was dropped or fired at the infrastructure and detonated inside the building**,” he said, adding it was unclear if it had been due to air-drop weapons, artillery or rocket fire.

Mr. da Silva said.

The UN buildings are situated in an “isolated area” in Dier al Balah.

Evacuating the injured
----------------------

As investigations continue into the incident, the “top priority” is the evacuation of injured staff members, Mr. Their efforts include delivering essential supplies such as fuel and assisting in demining and explosive removal.

Additionally, the agency manages the so-called UN 2720 Mechanism for Gaza, which was [mandated](https://docs.un.org/en/s/res/2720(2023))
 by the [Security Council](https://main.un.org/securitycouncil/)
 to accelerate humanitarian aid into the enclave.

UN chief condemns attacks
-------------------------

Tweet URL

[Secretary-General António Guterres](https://www.un.org/sg/)
 reaffirmed that all parties to the conflict have a legal obligation to protect UN premises, which must remain absolutely inviolable.

In a [statement](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2025-03-19/statement-attributable-the-spokesperson-for-the-secretary-general-%E2%80%93-gaza)
 issued by his spokesperson, the UN chief strongly condemned the attacks and called for a full investigation.

“**Today’s deadly strike brings the number of UN colleagues killed in Gaza since 7 October 2023 to at least 280**,” the statement noted.

Mr. The hostages must be released immediately and unconditionally,” said the statement.

 Print [Email](mailto:?subject=UN staff member killed in central Gaza blast, five others injured&body=https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/03/1161261 "Share this via Email") da Silva stressed that attacks against humanitarian premises are a breach of international law.  

“UN personnel and its premises must be protected by all sides. **The civilian population relies on the UN for lifesaving assistance, they are an essential lifeline at the time of utter tragedy and devastation**,” he said.

Previous attacks
----------------

The incident took place at around 11:30 AM local time on Wednesday. da Silva said.

“We have stayed and delivered for the people in Gaza in the last year and a half. This was not the first time a first colleague from UNOPS lost their life,” he added, noting that a staffer who drove aid trucks was killed around a year ago in the line of duty.

“**It is very difficult to operate in Gaza…we have been challenged by the fact that international humanitarian law has not been respected**,” he said.

UNOPS teams in Gaza have been carrying out critical humanitarian work, supporting hundreds of thousands of civilians severely affected by the conflict. Guterres emphasised that all military operations must respect and prioritise civilian protection.

“**The Secretary-General stresses the need for the ceasefire to be respected to bring an end to the suffering of the people**."

 members of his coalition to resume war against the Gaza Strip.[\[28\]](#cite_note-PBS20250318-28)

 and the [Trump administration](/wiki/Second_presidency_of_Donald_Trump "Second presidency of Donald Trump")
 insisted on renegotiating the overall terms.[\[14\]](#cite_note-BBC20250318-14)
 Israel also refused to withdraw from sites in the Gaza Strip, despite the fact that it had agreed to do so in the ceasefire agreement.[\[14\]](#cite_note-BBC20250318-14)
 Further, during the ceasefire, Israel killed more than 140 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.[\[14\]](#cite_note-BBC20250318-14)
 In March, Israel prevented all food and medicine from entering Gaza;[\[15\]](#cite_note-Time20250318-15)
 later it shut off electricity to the Gaza Strip's main desalination plant, effectively cutting off water.[\[16\]](#cite_note-Mahase2025-16)

Hamas condemned the strikes as a violation of the ceasefire, accusing Israel of endangering the remaining Israeli hostages.[\[19\]](#cite_note-Telegraph20250318-19)

Journalists among 20 Palestinians killed in Israeli strike on Gaza hospital – video

Israel bombed Gaza hospital a second time, killing rescuers, say health officials
=================================================================================

At least 20 people, including five journalists, died as they rushed to help those wounded in the first strike

Israel bombed the main hospital in southern Gaza on Monday and then struck the same spot again as rescuers and journalists rushed to help the wounded, killing at least 20 people including five journalists, health officials said.

The first strike hit the top floor of a building at the Nasser hospital, killing the [Reuters](https://www.theguardian.com/media/reuters)
 journalist Hussam al-Masri and others. A second video showed the aftermath of the bombings, with the bodies of the first responders and journalists lying on top of one another, bloody and covered in dust.

The [“double tap” strike](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/25/israel-attack-gaza-hospital-may-constitute-war-on-many-fronts)
 and killing of journalists prompted a wave of international condemnation, including from the UK foreign secretary, David Lammy. We need an immediate ceasefire,” Lammy wrote on X.

The US president, Donald Trump, told reporters: “I’m not happy about it,” when asked about the attack, while the French president, Emmanuel Macron, described it as “intolerable”.

Meanwhile, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said Israel deeply regretted what he described as a “tragic mishap” at the Nasser hospital.

Israel has regularly struck hospitals, claiming without evidence that Hamas uses them for military purposes. A [report](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/02/idf-no-fault-conclusion-alleged-war-abuse-cases-report)
 published this month showed that 88% of investigations into war crimes allegations in Gaza were shut down or left unresolved. She left behind a letter for her 13-year-old son, Ghaith, telling him: “Make me proud … become successful and excel.”

Abu Aziz was based in the Nasser hospital, where he covered the impact of Israel’s attacks on people across Gaza. Israel launched its assault after the 7 October 2023 attack on Israel by Hamas-led militants in which about 1,200 people were killed and 250 taken hostage.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that there was Israeli bombardment in Deir al-Balah in March 2025. The UN News article mentions an explosion at UN guesthouses, and the Wikipedia article discusses Israeli attacks in the Gaza Strip, including Deir al-Balah, during that period. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the bombardment killed at least four Palestinians. Therefore, the claim is partially supported but lacks specific confirmation of the casualty count.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

الصحفي محمد العويد

##### الصحفي محمد العويد ابن محافظة درعا، يتحدث لدرعا 24 عن تحديات وآفاق الإعلام السوري: نحو بناء إعلام حر ومستقل في مرحلة ما بعد النظام

**يشهد الإعلام السوري اليوم مرحلة مفصلية بعد سقوط النظام الذي أحكم قبضته على الصحافة ومؤسساتها لعقود طويلة**، ولا سيما خلال السنوات الثلاث عشرة الأخيرة. ومع هذا التحوّل، انفتح الباب أمام أفقٍ جديدٍ يطمح إليه الصحفيون والمؤسسات الإعلامية في سوريا، لتمكين العمل الإعلامي الحر والمستقل. ومع ذلك، فإن الطريق نحو تنظيم هذا القطاع وضمان حرية التعبير لا يزال مليئاً بالتحديات.

في هذا السياق **أجرت شبكة درعا 24 مقابلةً خاصّة مع الصحفي [محمد العويد](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100002329474787)
 من أبناء محافظة درعا**، للحديث عن هذا المشهد والكثير من الأمور المتعلقة به وتحديات وأولويات العمل الإعلامي في هذه المرحلة. يتناول الحوار قضايا مثل واقع الاتحادات التي أُنشئت مؤخرًا، وظروف الناشطين والصحفيين في البلاد، وأداء الحكومة في الجانب الإعلامي، والدور الذي يجب أن تضطلع به المؤسسات الصحفية لدعم التحول الإعلامي في سوريا.

**ينحدر الصحفي محمد العويد، من بلدة معربة في الريف الشرقي من محافظة درعا.** وهو خريج جامعة دمشق قسم الصحافة. عمل مديراً لفرع وكالة سانا في درعا، وفي صحف سورية أخرى قبل اندلاع الثورة في 2011. وعمل بعدها في تلفزيون “سوريا الشعب” الذي أُنشئ في عمّان في الأردن، حيث كان يقيم هناك. بعدها في تلفزيون “18 آذار” للمعارضة السورية. وفي عام 2014، هاجر إلى فرنسا. عمل من هناك مع تلفزيون “أورينت” كمراسل، وكذلك في موقع “زمان الوصل”. كما تعاون مع “تلفزيون سوريا”. وحالياً، ينشر مقالاته في عدد من المواقع الإلكترونية بصفة مستقلة، وليست دائمة.

كيف تُقيّم المشهد الإعلامي في سوريا اليوم بعد سقوط النظام الذي كان يُحكم قبضته بشكل كبير على الإعلام الرسمي وكل وسائل الإعلام في مناطق سيطرته؟ وما هي الآفاق التي تتطلع إليها من الإعلام السوري في المستقبل؟
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

أعتقد أن المشهد الإعلامي يعني – مرحليّاً – خلال هذه المرحلة لا يمكن تقييمه بالأدوات الطبيعية المعتادة؛ لأن الكل يشعرون أن هذه المرحلة هي مرحلة انتقالية، مرحلة تأتي بعد انهيار نظام الأسد وهروبه، وحل أكبر مؤسسات الدولة الأمنية والعسكرية. وبالتالي، **حالة الحرية – إذا جاز التعبير – في أوجها، في ذروتها، بدون أي ضوابط، بدون أي قواعد، في حالة من عدم المسؤولية الإعلامية.** لأن هناك سعة أفقية في انتشار الشائعات والمصادر غير المسؤولة، وعدم التأكد من الأخبار في حالة متناقضة بالقدر الذي نرى فيه الوجه الإعلامي الإيجابي من الحريات التي سادت في سوريا بعد فترة كبت طالت أكثر من عقود، نرى أيضاً غياب أدوات الدولة أو مؤسساتها التي يفترض أن تكون هي المصدر الرئيسي لفهم هذه التحولات، أو المصدر الرئيسي للأخبار التي تخاطب الناس أو تكون مصدراً للمعلومات منها.

كيف يمكن بناء إعلام يتمتع بالحرية في سوريا؟ وما هي التحديات التي تعيق تحقيق ذلك في المرحلة القادمة؟
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

بتقديري، أولاً، يفترض أن يتحمل الجميع المسؤولية كشارع، كصحفيين، كنخب سياسية، وأن تكون على قدر المسؤولية. لأن المرحلة لها خصوصيتها، وثانياً، الشكل الطبيعي أن تبادر الناس، أن تبادر هذه القوى المجتمعية في الإعلام والسياسة إلى إعادة ترتيب أوراقها، إعادة ترتيب أولوياتها. وأن تكون إذا لم تكن الشراكة متاحة الآن مع أدوات الدولة أو سلطة الدولة، فلتكن في الجهة المقابلة. لكن تقديري أنها تحتاج بعض الوقت، لأنه الأسباب الموضوعية لغياب هذه الكتل التي يفترض أن تكون صلب أو مقومات الحريات الإعلامية، إن واقع المعارضة بعد العام 2011 لم يكن خاضعاً بالمعنى الحقيقي لبنية المؤسسات. وإذا شاءت ووجدت مؤسسة، فهي تحكم جمهورها السوري المنتشر في أصقاع العالم، في كل دول العالم. **فالآليات التي كانت سائدة خلال فترة المعارضة وإعلامها هي أقرب لمرحلة الفوضى وليس التنظيم**، لأنه أنت لا تحكم في جغرافية محددة، أنت توجّه خطاباً، وردّ هذا الخطاب من الجمهور لا تخضع لأي قواعد.

الآن الفرصة الاستثنائية هي أنه **أصبح للسوريين وطن وجغرافيا يمكن الالتزام بقواعدها وآلياتها،** كما هو في بقية البلدان، بدءًا من الجوار السوري في الأردن أو الشمال التركي، وصولًا إلى دول العالم الآخر. فبتقديري أنه **يجب أن نكون صريحين مع أنفسنا وتتحمل هذه القوى الجديدة مسؤولياتها وأولوياتها وواجباتها ووظيفتها**، من خلال أولاً تنظيم صفوفها، ومن خلال أن تكون هي الرافع الحقيقي للحريات. ولا نعول وننتظر حتى تمنحنا السلطة الحريات على طبق من ذهب.

ما هي الأولويات العاجلة التي يجب على المؤسسات الإعلامية والجهات الفاعلة تحقيقها لضمان حرية الصحافة في سوريا الجديدة؟
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

أعتقد أن ترتيب هذه الأولويات سيكون مرهوناً بوجه السلطة القادمة. على الأقل خلال شهر آذار، سيتم إعلان تشكيل الحكومة، ومن المفترض أن يصدر عن هذا التشكيل لاحقاً – بالتوازي مع المؤتمر الوطني – البيان الدستوري. كما يُفترض أن يصدر معه بعض التعاميم أو القرارات التي تُحدد وتشرح وتؤطر مجموعة القوانين الناظمة للحياة السياسية والإعلامية. لأنه بدون هذا الجانب السياسي أولاً، لا يمكن للقوى السياسية أن تعمل.

بمعنى آخر، في الجانب الإعلامي، ما هي الأطر التي أعمل كصحفي بموجبها؟ هذه الأمور غير واضحة حالياً، لأنه ليس لدي أُطر ولا قوانين، والأمور متروكة الآن. لكن ا**لعاجل، بتقديري، هو أن تتولى القوى السياسية، ومن ضمنها القوى المدنية في الجانب الإعلامي، المسؤولية وأن تتهيأ لهذا الدور**. يجب أن تكون هذه القوى جاهزة، وأن تكون قادرة على ضم كوادرها والاستعداد للمرحلة القادمة. إذا لم تكن المؤسسات الإعلامية متاحة حالياً، فعلى الأقل في المرحلة القادمة، **يجب أن تكون هذه المؤسسات جاهزة إلى جانب المعارضة، وأن يكون لديها خطابها وبنودها التي ستطلبها من السلطة وتتناقش معها حولها،** سواء ما يتعلق بالإعلام أو بحريات الصحافة أو بالقانون الإلكتروني. كل هذه الأشياء يجب أن تبادر الجهات المدنية والصحفيين والنخبة الثقافية إلى تهيئة أوراقها، حتى تكون جاهزة في المرحلة القادمة.

**أعتقد أن أبرز تحدي حالياً هو تأخر السلطة السياسية في إعلان موقفها، على الأقل إعلامياً**. ما هي الأجواء التي ينبغي على الصحافة أن تعمل بموجبها. هل تترك بهذا الشكل غير المنضبط، ولكن في حدود معقولة؟ أم نعود إلى حالة من التنظيم؟ لأن أهم ما في الإعلام – إذا جاز التعبير بين هلالين – هو “لعبة المُشاكسة” مع الحكومة، وكل مُشاكسة تستوجب أن يكون هناك قواعد ضبط بين الطرفين. **للأسف، حتى الآن، غير واضح تماماً ما هي القواعد بين الطرفين. هل هو دستور 2012؟ هل هو قانون المطبوعات السوري؟** يبدو أن الأمور تُركت بهذا الشكل.

**لذلك، أعتقد أن أول الأولويات التي يجب أن تكون حاضرة وهو أن تتهيأ الأطراف المدنية لتلعب هذا الدور، وأن تكون على الأقل جاهزة فيما إذا ذهبت السلطة السياسية إلى اعتماد قانون ما. يجب أن يكون لديها النموذج المقنع والحضور الجماهيري.**

كيف يمكن للإعلام أن يساهم في بناء مستقبل سوريا الجديد؟ وما هو الدور الذي يجب أن تلعبه الحكومة لدعم هذا التوجه؟
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

جزء من وظيفة الإعلام دوماً أن يلعب دوراً محورياً في أي مجتمع، سواء في سوريا أو غيرها. وبالتأكيد، في الحالة السورية، هذا الدور مُضاعف بسبب الظروف الاستثنائية التي تمر بها البلاد. **في المجتمعات المستقرة، عادةً ما يلعب الإعلام دوراً ضمن قواعد السوق، حيث يكون الدافع هو السبق الصحفي، الشهرة، التسريبات، والعناوين المغرية** التي تجذب الجمهور وتزيد من انتشار المؤسسات الصحفية. هذه الممارسات تعتبر جزءاً من لعبة “العرض والطلب” في السوق الإعلامي.

لكن في الحالة السورية، الوضع مختلف تماماً. **أحد التحديات الرئيسية هو أن الإعلام يجب أن يضع القيمة الأخلاقية في أولوية عمله – أي خبر قد يخلق بلبلة كبيرة في المجتمع السوري -، خاصةً أن بنية الدولة ما زالت هشة وغير مستقرة.** لذلك، أعتقد أن سلم الأولويات في الحالة السورية يجب أن يختلف قليلاً، وأن يُراعى في الحالة السورية **أن تكون الأولوية للبناء وليس فقط للممارسات الإعلامية التي نراها في المجتمعات المستقرة**، والتي لديها باع طويل في تحمّل أعراف الصحافة الجديدة وحقها في السوق. في الحالة السورية، الوضع يحتاج من الإعلامي أن يرتب أولوياته بشكل مختلف، مع **التركيز بشكل خاص على الأولويات الأخلاقية للمهنة.** يجب أن يكون المقياس الأخلاقي والحالة الوطنية، أي: هل تتحمل الناس هذه الأنشطة الصحفية؟ التي عادةً ما تكون حق للصحفي.

بالتالي، لا بأس بتقديري من تعزيز هذه التوصيفات والبنية الأخلاقية في الصحافة، على الأقل مرحلياً، حتى يستقيم بنيان المجتمع السوري وتعود الصحافة إلى دورها الطبيعي.

ما تقييمك للخطوات التي اتخذتها الحكومة الجديدة فيما يتعلق بالإعلام؟ وكيف يمكن للإعلام أن يلعب دوراً رقابياً على أداء الحكومة في هذه المرحلة؟ وهل تتقبل الحكومة هذا الدور؟
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

بالنسبة للخطوات التي اتخذتها الحكومة، **حتى الآن لم تتخذ خطوات حقيقية**. ما نراه هو الطبيعي. بعد تحرير دمشق، حيث أن دمشق بأهميتها، التي تعتبر مأساة القرن، نحن أمام مشهد بالغ الأهمية من الطبيعي أن يستقطب كل الإعلام العالمي والمؤسسات الإعلامية. **أعتقد أن الإدارة المؤقتة ربما سهلت – إذا جاز التعبير – أو تعاطت مع الأمر بإيجابية، لأنها تريد إيصال رسالة مفادها أن هذه المرحلة تختلف عن مرحلة الأسد، التي كانت تتطلب الموافقات الأمنية وزيارات الفروع الأمنية،** وكانت هناك محدودية في قدرة الصحف والمؤسسات على العمل بحرية.

**الإدارة الجديدة قدمت رسالة سياسية أكثر من كونها إعلامية**، لأن الناس في الإعلام تنتظر بنية إعلامية وقانونية واضحة حتى تستطيع أن تستمر، وحتى تعرف ما هي الأرضية الصلبة التي تقف عليها. هذا الأمر ضروري حتى تستطيع أن تلعب دورها الرقابي على الإعلام، وهذا هو المطلوب. لكن موقف الحكومة حتى الآن – وهذا نعزوه للظرف الذي تمر به الإدارة الجديدة، وهي مرحلة انتقالية أو حتى ما قبل الانتقالية – لأنها استلمت بلداً ينوء من الخراب في كل هياكله، بما فيها الهياكل الإعلامية.

**سواء قبلت الحكومة الدور الرقابي للإعلام أم لم تقبله، فاعتقد أنه إذا استطاعت القوى الإعلامية والمنظمات الصحفية وكتلة الصحفيين والمثقفين أن تكون جاهزة ومنظمة لهذا الدور**، فسيقوم الإعلام بأداء دوره الرقابي بشكل طبيعي، ولكن ضمن الأطر والشروط التي سيتم الاتفاق عليها في المرحلة القادمة.

ما هي أبرز الأولويات التي يجب على الإعلاميين السوريين التركيز عليها خلال الفترة الانتقالية؟
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

فيما يتعلق بالأولويات، أعتقد أنه من الصعب أن أكون جزءاً من الحالة الصحفية وفي نفس الوقت أطالب بإنهاء حالة الفردية وتعزيز القيم الأخلاقية لمهنة الصحافة. أفهم أن الأمر ليس سهلاً، لأن الصحفي يعيش كما الشاعر ليقول فيها للناس: “ها أنا هنا كصحفي، لدي سبق، لدي تحقيق، لدي… إلخ”. لكن الحالة السورية، بما أنها حالة وطنية استثنائية، تستوجب سلم من الأولويات مختلفة قليلاً.

بدلاً من أن تكون الأولوية لدي كصحفي أو كمؤسسة إعلامية هي السبق الصحفي، يجب أن تكون الأولوية للقيمة الأخلاقية والمسؤولية الوطنية (كما أسلفت). هذا لا يعني إنهاء دوري كصحفي، بل يعني الانتقال من الحالة الفردية إلى حالة من المشاورة والتعاون مع زملائي في العمل ومع المؤسسة الإعلامية التي أنتمي إليها، ومؤسستي لديها تشبيك مع مؤسسات أخرى، وبالتالي نعيد ترتيب الأولويات بما يتناسب مع خصوصية الحالة السورية.

وهذا يعزز الدور المؤسساتي للإعلام ويعطي صورة أفضل من الصورة السابقة. قبل 13 سنة، **كنا نعيش حالة فردية، بل وحتى حالة فصائلية في الإعلام. الآن، نحن أمام حالة وطنية تستوجب الدقة والتعاون مع الآخرين أكثر من أي وقت مضى**. هذه الحالة تستوجب التركيز على القيم العليا، وأولها القيمة الوطنية وقيمة المواطنة والحريات. كل هذا يتطلب تخفيف حالة التفرد والذاتية التي نمارسها عادةً كصحفيين.

ما هو رأيك بالأفكار التي تدعو لإلغاء وزارة الإعلام – أسوةً بكثير من دول العالم – كخطوة لدعم حرية الصحافة؟ وهل تعتقد أن هناك بدائل أفضل لتنظيم القطاع الإعلامي؟
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

في قضية **الدعوة لإلغاء وزارة الإعلام، أعتقد أن هذا الطرح مبكرٌ جداً، خصوصاً في الحالة السورية**. صعوبة الأسئلة المطروحة اليوم، سواء كانت إعلامية أو سياسية أو دينية، وكل البرامج المقدمة، لا تراعي بشكل كافٍ الحالة الاستثنائية التي تمر بها سوريا. إذا نظرنا إلى دولة مستقرة مثل المملكة الأردنية، يمكن أن يثار نقاش حول إلغاء وزارة الإعلام، لأن هناك بنى مدنية ومؤسساتية قائمة منذ أكثر من خمسين سنة. لكن في الحالة السورية، الوضع مختلف تماماً.

**يجب أن نفهم خصوصية الحالة السورية البالغة الحساسية. القوى القادمة من المعارضة، والتي ستُدير البلد بشكل أو بآخر، لم تكن منضبطة خلال السنوات الـ13 الماضية**. كانت هذه القوى مشتتة. لكن لأول مرة الجغرافيا السورية ستتعامل معها ضمن أطر قانونية. أنا في فرنسا، ملتزم بقانون الإعلام الفرنسي، لكني لست ملتزماً بالقانون التركي. الآن، في سوريا، أصبحت ملتزماً بالحالة السورية ككل. لأول مرة، تتاح فرصة لأن يكون المرسل والمستقبل في جغرافية واحدة تحكمها القواعد نفسها. هذا يحتاج إلى تأطير وإنهاء المرحلة السابقة التي كانت قائمة على الفوضى وعدم الانضباط.

ليس هناك قانون يحكم العلاقة بين تلفزيون سوريا في تركيا (الذي يعمل في المنطقة الحرة ولا يخضع للقوانين التركية) وبين جمهوره في أمريكا أو لبنان أو الأردن أو حتى داخل سوريا. الآن، لأول مرة، يفترض أن تتاح لعبة إعلامية مهمة جداً، حيث **يلتزم كل من المرسل والمستقبل بقواعد تندرج تحت قانون الإعلام السوري والقانون العام السوري بضوابطه وقواعده وتعريفاته**. هذا يحتاج إلى جهد كبير حتى نعتاد عليه.

في المراحل القادمة، بعد استقرار الدولة، **إذا رأى أهل التشريع أن البلد لم تعد بحاجة إلى وزارة الإعلام، فليكن ذلك. أنا مع دعاة توسيع مجال الحرية بلا حدود أمام المؤسسات الإعلامية، لكن في الحالة السورية، أقف وأشعر بالخوف. هذه الحالة هي أكثر الحالات التي تستوجب الضبط والقوننة، وليس العكس.**

كيف ترى الخطوات التي تُتخذ اليوم التي تهدف لتوحيد الإعلاميين والصحفيين في عدة مناطق في سوريا وتأسيس اتحادات؟ هل ترى أن هذا يساهم في توحيد الخطاب الإعلامي وتنظيم العمل، أم أنها قد تؤدي إلى تهديد حرية التعبير وطمس التنوع الإعلامي؟
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

مسألة توحيد الإعلاميين وتأسيس اتحادات، الأصل في ذلك أنه مباح والضروري والمهم، **لكنني شخصياً متخوف من جملة المشهد الإعلامي ومعطيات المشهد السياسي**. عادةً، في بلاد الشتات، اعتدنا أن أي مجموعة تعمل اتحاداً، وهذا الاتحاد يشابه – للأسف – الحالة السياسية أو أي حالة أخرى من التجمعات السورية. السبب في ذلك هو إنّه لم يكن لدينا “بيت” بالمعنى الحقيقي، فكنا نلجأ إلى وسائل التواصل الاجتماعي والتعميمات المفتوحة، مع غياب القواعد الحقيقية.

**الخوف الآن هو من الاستسهال في المشهد السوري. بمعنى أنه غداً أو بعده، سنرى اتحادات صحفية في كل محافظة، وفي العاصمة دمشق، ستظهر اتحادات بأسماء متعددة**. المشكلة أن هذه الاتحادات، للأسف، هي استمرار للحالة السابقة، واستمرار للحالة التي كانت قائمة في الشتات. 

وهنا لا أريد أن يفهم كلامي كهجوم على أحد من زملائنا، **لكني أرى أن الإشكالية الحقيقية هي أننا نحاول صناعة “نمور من ورق” مجدداً، في حين أن الفرصة اليوم متاحة في دمشق لصناعة “نمور حقيقية”**.

بمعنى أن الراغبين في العمل السياسي والإعلامي، إصبح لدينا الآن وطن وبيت يمكننا اللقاء فيه، ولم نعد بحاجة إلى الأساليب القديمة التي تركت آثاراً سلبية. هذه فرصة حقيقية لبناء اتحادات قائمة على قواعد واضحة وفهم مشترك للآليات والدوافع.

النقطة الأهم هي أننا الآن أمام بيت، لكن الواجبات كثيرة. يجب أن نبدأ بتأثيث هذا البيت، تجميله، وتقديمه للجمهور. هل كل من في هذا البيت متوافق معك على الرؤية والقواعد والشروط والأولويات؟ من فهمي، أرى أن إشكالية الاتحادات التي تعلن عن نفسها بشكل متسارع تشبه إلى حد كبير القوى السياسية. ربما هذا بسبب خصوصية المرحلة، أو الظروف الراهنة، أو الرغبة في المشاركة، وهذا كله صحيح. لكن شخصياً، **أميل إلى أن قواعد وآليات تأسيس الاتحادات والروابط يجب أن تكون مختلفة عما يجري على أرض الواقع. لأنه لأول مرة سنكون أمام بُنى ستعتمد على ذاتها، وليس على دعم أو رعاية من هنا أو من هناك**. هذا البيت يجب أن يعتمد على اشتراكات الأعضاء. **هل الأعضاء في الحالة السورية جاهزون لهذا؟** أتمنى ذلك. هل الأعضاء سيكونون في حالة من الانضباط المؤسسي؟ أتمنى ذلك أيضاً.

بمعنى أن الاتحاد بهيكليته سيكون صاحب الموقف، وليس كل عضو بمفرده. الاتحاد سيكون ممثلاً للأعضاء، وهذه الجزئية لم نعتد عليها خلال السنوات الـ13 الماضية، حيث كانت الاتحادات التي نشأت عبارة عن صفحات تواصل اجتماعي، وبالتالي كانت أدوات ضبط الأعضاء غير ممكنة، فكيف تضبط أنا في فرنسا والآخر في تركيا والثالث في أمريكا والرابع في سوريا. الفرصة الآن هي أن أصبح هناك بيت يجمع الجميع، وهي فرصة تاريخية. لكن يجب أن نبادر كصحفيين إلى استثمار أقصى طاقاتنا في هذا الجانب.

ما أبرز التحديات التي تواجه الصحفيين في درعا في المرحلة الحالية، وكيف يمكن للإعلام المحلي أن يساهم في إيصال صوت المجتمعات المحلية للحكومة وللعالم؟ وما هو مستقبل العمل الصحفي في درعا وسوريا؟
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

فيما يتعلق بوضع درعا، هي جزء من الكل السوري. إذا استطاعت درعا أن تواكب الحالة الإعلامية السورية العامة، فهذا أمر جيد ويُحسب لها. بالتأكيد، أ**ي إعلام محلي يساهم في وصول صوت جمهوره أو المجتمع المحلي الذي يحاول أن يكون صوته.**

التحديات في درعا تشبه التحديات في المشهد الإعلامي السوري ككل. مرة أخرى، نحن أمام لحظة فارقة: أصبح لديك بيت بعد أن كان أعضاء هذا البيت، من الأب إلى الأبناء، مشتتين في كل أنحاء العالم. ولأول مرة، يستوجب بناء هذا البيت حضور الجميع ومشاركة الجميع. لكن يبدو أن ثمة ظروفاً أو معيقات ستكون عائقاً أمام اكتمال هذه العائلة. هذه المشكلة تنطبق على الحالة الصحفية في درعا، كما تنطبق على الحالة الصحفية في عموم سوريا.

بمعنى، ماذا عن الزملاء الآخرين؟ هل سيعودون؟ هذا غير واضح. وماذا عن المؤسسات القائمة وكوادرها؟ ما هي الخيارات ؟ هذا أيضاً غير واضح. وماذا عن النشطاء الذين هم جزء كبير من المشهد الإعلامي السوري اليوم؟ حملوا أرواحهم على أيديهم وضحوا، ولدينا تضحيات جسيمة، نقف أمامها بإجلال. لكنه سؤال مرّ يحتاج إلى وضوح وإجابة: **ماذا تفعل أمام كتلة لا يستهان بها من الشباب من النشطاء الإعلاميين؟ ما هي الخيارات؟ هل تقول لهم “كفيتم ووفيتم”؟ بالتأكيد، هذا لا يستقيم. يجب أن نستفيد من تجربتهم، أولاً هذا حقهم أن يكونوا جزءاً من المشهد القادم، لكن ضمن أي شروط؟ ضمن أي معطيات؟**

كل هذه الأسئلة تشكل تحديات كبيرة تحتاج إلى إجابات. وأنا بتقديري أن الأهم هو أن تكون هذه المجموعة أو هؤلاء الصحفيين هم من يثيروا هذه الأسئلة، وهم من يعبر عن أدواتهم، ويعرفوا عن هويتهم. كل هذه الأسئلة يفترض أن يصوغوها هم، بمساعدة الآخرين، بمساعدة زملائهم السابقين، وبالتشبيك بين بعضهم. لكن عليهم هم أن يثيروا هذه الأسئلة.

ما هي رسالة محمد العويد للصحفيين في درعا؟ وكيف يمكنهم أن يكونوا أكثر فاعلية في المشهد؟
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

أعتقد أن المهم جداً هو أن يعمل كل ناشط، كل مواطن صحفي، وكل مهتم بالشأن الإعلامي في المحافظة، ويبادر بالتشبيك مع الآخرين من زملائه. **المهم الآن هو أن يفهم الجميع أن الأصوات الفردية لن يكون لها جدوى في المرحلة القادمة**، حتى لو كان مشهور أو ذو باع طويل لن يحقق شيئاً، لأن الأصوات الفردية لن تكون ذات جدوى أمام هذا المشهد بالغ التطور والمتسارع، والذي يعاد بناؤه في سوريا.

المشروع بهذا الحجم، على مستوى الوطن السوري، يحتاج بالمقابل إلى أن يكون هناك روافد أو أجنحة، وليس حالات فردية. **أنا من دعاة الحالة الجماعية في هذا المعنى. للصحفيين في درعا، وللمهتمين بالشأن الإعلامي**، أن تكون الدعوة دائمة إلى لقاءات دائمة على مدار الشهر أو الأسبوع، يتم فيها طرح هذه الأسئلة، تبدأ من الهوية: من نحن؟ ماذا ينتظرنا؟ ما هي حقوقنا؟ كيف نعمل؟ ما هي مصلحتنا؟ أن نشبك مع بعضنا البعض؟ هل نعمل كأفراد؟ كل هذه الأسئلة واستحقاقاتها مهمة، وأعتقد أنه يجب أن يكون هناك محاولات للحصول على أجوبة لها، وليس أن تبقى مجرد أسئلة في الفضاء المفتوح. لأن التحديات كبيرة، والحقوق كثيرة. بدلاً من الحالة الفردية، التي من مشاكلها أنها تقبل أحياناً باللا شيء (مثلاً، أن تكون مراسلاً في درعا لمؤسسة في دمشق وأن يُقبل)، لكن بالحالة الجمعية أن يسأل ويكون خلفه مؤسسة أو مجموعة تسأل ما هي حقوقه.

يجب أن نعي أن المرحلة القادمة، حتى في حالة المواطن الصحفي، لم يعد من المقبول التطوع. العمل الإعلامي يجب أن ينتهي بهذه الطريقة. **العمل الإعلامي هو عمل يومي، مضني، إشكالي، بجوانبه المتعددة قانوني، وأحياناً يضعك في مواجهة السلطة أو الشارع.** كل هذه الأشياء يجب أن يكون ما يحميها، بدءاً من الجانب التعويض المالي وصولاً إلى الحقوق داخل المؤسسة التي تعمل بها.

لذلك، أنا أميل إلى ضرورة الحالة الجمعية بين الناس والتكاتف فيما بينها، وإثارة كل هذه الأسئلة. في المشهد السابق، **هناك متطوعون، وشهدنا مئات وعشرات الشهداء الذين لا نعرف الآن من هي المؤسسات أو الجهات التي ستعنى بهم أو بعوائلهم أو بأبنائهم**. مرحلة الاستقرار في سوريا اليوم تختلف. إذا كنت مواطناً صحفياً، يجب أن تسأل أولاً: ما هي حقوقي لدى المؤسسة التي أتعامل معها أو التي أتطوع لأجلها؟ هذا أبسط الأسئلة. لم يعد المشهد كما في السابق، حيث كنا نعتمد على العفوية أو النخوة. الآن، انتقلنا إلى مرحلة المأسسة. المأسسة تختلف، لأنك تتعامل مع مؤسسة، وأولى الأشياء التي يجب أن تُطرح هي: ما هي حقوقي؟ ما هي واجباتي؟ ماذا عليّ؟ وماذا لكم؟ هذه الأسئلة تريح الطرفين وتساعد على بناء علاقة مستقرة وطويلة الأمد.

**من وجهة نظري، يفترض أن يتعاون الجميع في هذه المرحلة. هذه واحدة من التحديات، وربما أهمها.**

قصف إسرائيلي على أهداف سورية - صورة أرشيقية من موقع المرصد السوري

أعلنت وزارة الدفاع السورية تفاصيل العدوان الجوي الذي شنته قوات الاحتلال، اليوم السبت، على العاصمة دمشق.

وقالت وزارة الدفاع السورية، في ما نشرته على لسان مصدر عسكري عبر صفحتها الرسمية على موقع فيسبوك، أنه في «حوالي الساعة 1:35 من فجر اليوم السبت، نفذ العدو الإسرائيلي عدوانا جويا من اتجاه الجولان السوري المحتل مستهدفا بعض النقاط في محيط مدينة دمشق».

وأضاف المصدر: «تصدت وسائط دفاعنا الجوي لصواريخ العدوان وأسقطت معظمها، واقتصرت الخسائر على الماديات».

بيان وزارة الدفاع السورية

وفي وقت سابق، اليوم السبت، ذكرت وسائل الإعلام الرسمية السورية أن إسرائيل شنت هجوما جويا على محيط العاصمة السورية دمشق.

كما أفادت وسائل الإعلام السورية بسماع دوي انفجارات متتالية في دمشق.

وذكر موقع روسيا اليوم أن الدفاعات الجوية السورية نجحت في التصدى لأهداف معادية في أجواء محيط العاصمة دمشق، موضحا أن الانفجارات القوية بدأت في الساعة 01:35 بتوقيت دمشق، مشيرا إلى أنها استمرت دقائق عدة.

#### **غزة تواجه الإبادة**

ولليوم الـ57، يواصل الاحتلال عدوانه على قطاع غزة الذي بدأ في السابع من أكتوبر/ تشرين الأول، بعد قيام المقاومة الفلسطينية بتنفيذ عملية طوفان الأقصى، بمنطقة غلاف غزة، وبعد انتهاء الهدنة الإنسانية المؤقتة في القطاع، صباح يوم الجمعة، وهو اليوم الـ56 للعدوان.

وتتواصل الغارات التي تشنها مقاتلات الاحتلال، مما أدى إلى ارتقاء آلاف الشهداء والجرحى.

وأعلن المكتب الإعلامي الحكومي في غزة، أمس الجمعة، ارتفاع عدد الشهداء إلى 15 ألفا و110 فلسطينيين، بينهم 6150 طفلا و4000 سيدة.

وذكر المكتب الحكومي، في بيان، أن عدد شهداء الكوادر الطبية بلغ نحو 207 أطباء وممرضين ومسعفين، كما استشهد 73 صحفيا.

وزاد إجمالي عدد الإصابات عن 37 ألف حالة، أكثر من 75% منهم من الأطفال والنساء.

وأوضح أن إجمالي عدد البلاغات عن المفقودين تحت الأنقاض بلغ 6500 بلاغ، فيما بلغ إجمالي عدد الوحدات السكنية التي تضررت كليا أو جزئيا 300 ألف وحدة، إلى جانب استهداف 266 مدرسة، وخروج 26 مستشفى من الخدمة فضلا عن تدمير 56 سيارة إسعاف.

Israeli warplanes hit the town of Kiswa, approximately 20km (12 miles) south of Damascus, as well as the southern province of Deraa late on Tuesday, residents, security sources and local broadcaster Syria TV said.

The Israeli army said it struck “military targets in southern Syria, including command centres and multiple sites containing weapons”, without specifying exact locations.

Residents of Damascus reported hearing the sound of planes flying several low passes over the capital and a series of blasts.

“The Air Force is attacking strongly in southern Syria as part of the new policy we have defined of pacifying southern Syria – and the message is clear: we will not allow southern Syria to become southern Lebanon,” Defence Minister Israel Katz’s spokesperson said in a statement.

“Any attempt by the Syrian regime forces and the country’s terrorist organisations to establish themselves in the security zone in southern Syria will be met with fire,” the statement added.

The bombardment came hours after Syria condemned Israel’s incursion into the country’s south and demanded it withdraw, according to the closing statement of a [national dialogue summit](/news/2025/2/26/key-takeaways-from-syrias-national-dialogue-conference)
. The summit, organised by Syria’s new government, aimed to outline the country’s political roadmap after the toppling of President [Bashar al-Assad](/news/2025/2/12/syrias-leader-russias-putin-make-first-contact-since-al-assads-fall)
 in December.

Israel moved forces into a United Nations-monitored demilitarised zone within Syria after al-Assad’s removal, a move that violated the 1974 disengagement agreement with Syria.

On Sunday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called for the [“demilitarisation” of southern Syria](/news/2025/2/23/israel-wont-allow-syria-military-forces-south-of-damascus-netanyahu)
, saying Israel “will not allow the new Syrian army to move into territory south of Damascus”.

Jordan’s King Abdullah told Syria’s interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa after a meeting in Amman on Wednesday he condemned Israeli attacks on Syria, a palace statement said.

Palestinian group Hamas also condemned the air strikes in the “strongest terms”, calling them “a blatant attack on Syrian sovereignty” and a continuation of Israel’s aggression against Arab nations.

The attacks complicate efforts by Syria’s new administration to reunify the country, said Qutaiba Idlbi, a resident senior fellow for Syria at the Atlantic Council.

He said the air raids coincided with the national dialogue summit on Syria’s political transition, which has already faced challenges, particularly in negotiations with the Druze community in the south and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces in the northeast.

“The strikes on Damascus are only going to serve to delay such agreement, as the powers in northeast and southern Syria will feel more empowered to seek deals and perhaps military support from external actors to increase their leverage in negotiations with Damascus,” Idlbi told Al Jazeera.

Military sites hit as Tel Aviv says it ‘will not allow southern Syria to become southern Lebanon’

Israeli warplanes have carried out several airstrikes on military targets outside Damascus and in southern Syria, as Israeli officials warned the country’s army not to move south of the capital city.

Israeli jets struck military sites late on Tuesday in the town of Kiswah, south of Damascus, as well as in the southern province of Deraa, local [Syrian media](https://www.syria.tv/%D8%B7%D8%A7%D8%A6%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A5%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%87%D8%AF%D9%81-%D8%AC%D9%86%D9%88%D8%A8%D9%8A-%D8%AF%D9%85%D8%B4%D9%82-%D9%88%D8%AA%D9%88%D8%BA%D9%84-%D8%A8%D8%B1%D9%8A-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%B9%D8%A7-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%B7%D8%B1%D8%A9)
 reported.

The Israeli defence minister, Israel Katz, confirmed the strikes in southern [Syria](https://www.theguardian.com/world/syria)
 and warned that Israel “will not allow southern Syria to become southern Lebanon”.

Katz added that “any attempt by the Syrian regime forces and the country’s terrorist organisations to establish themselves in the security zone in southern Syria will be met with fire”.

On Sunday the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, demanded the complete demilitarisation of southern Syria.

Shortly after a Syrian rebel offensive led by Islamist opposition group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham [toppled the Assad regime on 8 December](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/08/syrians-celebrate-fall-of-bashar-al-assad-after-five-decades-of-dynastic-rule)
, Israeli forces entered the UN buffer zone between Israel and Syria. Israeli airstrikes in Syria had mostly stopped since the new year.

Hours before the Israeli bombings on Tuesday, Syria condemned Israel’s invasion of the buffer zone and called for it to withdraw its forces from Syrian territory. <image:6632>

----------- Israeli forces have remained there ever since, despite protests by Syria’s new government and the UN, which monitors the demilitarised zone between the two countries.

[Israel’s air force also carried out hundreds of airstrikes](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/10/israel-strikes-hundreds-of-military-targets-in-syria)
 against weapons depots, naval bases and Syrian military infrastructure in the weeks after the fall of the Assad regime in an attempt to prevent the weaponry from falling into rebel hands. The statement was issued at the end of a national dialogue conference which gathered hundreds of Syrian activists and leaders to plan the country’s post-Assad political transition.

Besides verbal condemnations, the new Syrian government has not confronted Israeli forces in Syria."

Some on X are calling it the ‘Israeli Motorola massacre,’ blaming Motorola for manufacturing the deadly Hezbollah pagers that exploded in Lebanon. For years, the American mobile company has faced boycotts, accused of supplying the Israeli army with communication and bomb equipment devices. We tell you more in this edition of Truth or Fake.

Israeli airstrikes have devastated southern Lebanon, and Hezbollah has launched hundreds of missiles into Israeli territory. However, some viral images claiming to show the aftermath are fakeImage: Gil Nechushtan/AP Photo/picture alliance

Advertisement

Since the past weekend, Israel and Hezbollah have engaged in the [most intense exchange of fire](/en/middle-east-idf-prepares-for-possibility-of-lebanon-entry/live-70318800)
 one year into the Israel-Hamas war in [Gaza](/en/gaza/t-19074241)
. The armed wing of the Iran-backed Shiite political party and militant group, which is considered a terrorist organization by the US, Germany and several Sunni Arab countries, fired projectiles deeper into Israeli territory than ever before.

On Saturday, Israel launched waves of strikes against Hezbollah targets, describing the action as preemptive to thwart a planned attack. Hezbollah, in turn, fired a barrage of rockets and other projectiles at Israel, claiming it was in retaliation for Israeli strikes in [Lebanon](/en/lebanon/t-19131661)
.

Lebanon's Health Ministry reported at least 569 people killed, including 50 children, and more than 1,800 wounded since Monday.

The recent escalation between [Israel](/en/israel/t-19067044)
 and [Hezbollah](/en/hezbollah/t-41508807)
 has also fueled a surge of misleading content. A recurrent theme in social media posts involves manipulated visuals claiming to show Hezbollah's attacks on Israel. Often out of context or entirely unrelated, these videos have gone viral on social media platforms. [DW Fact check](/en/fact-check/t-56584214)
 investigated some of these viral claims.

Does this image show the aftermath of a Hezbollah attack on Ramat David airbase?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Claim:** "_Despite Israel's hermetic military censorship. A photograph was leaked of the Ramat David base, which was attacked by Hezbollah at dawn today. Israel does not acknowledge that anything has happened at this air base,_" reads [the caption of a viral image](https://archive.is/uwdRN "External link — the caption of a viral image")
 circulating on social media. The image shows a large aircraft engulfed in flames, surrounded by vehicles at an airport, with military trucks and personnel scattered in the scene.

The Hezbollah attack targeted the Ramat David airbase near Haifa on Sunday, but this picture is fakeImage: Reddit

The image has been shared across multiple platforms, including  [X](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/OH9Ef "External link — X")
 (formerly Twitter), [Reddit](https://archive.is/uwdRN "External link — Reddit")
, and [Threads](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/wjvSK "External link — Threads")
, reaching users in several languages, including Arabic.

**DW Fact check:** Fake.

Israeli media have [reported](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-821267 "External link — reported")
 on the attack at Ramat David airbase in the North of the country, which occurred on Sunday morning. However, there are clear indications that the image being shared is AI-generated.

One of the most prominent signs of this being AI-generated content is the blurry and indecipherable text. The vehicle in the middle, closer to the camera, shows what appears to be writing on its side, but the text is distorted and unreadable. Some characters resemble Hebrew letters, but others don't make any sense. This is a common AI flaw, known as a "hallucination," which occurs when the system creates elements that don't exist or don't make sense in the real world.

Some details in the image are distorted, unrealistic or blurred which are indicators of it being AI-generatedImage: Reddit

The image also shows multiple visual distortions, particularly in the shapes and outlines of objects. The truck in the foreground has an awkward curve in its loading section. The vehicles closest to the plane seem fused, with their outlines merging unnaturally, making them difficult to distinguish. Most military vehicles in the image look unrealistic. Such errors are typical in AI-generated images.

Also, the aircraft's wing appears misaligned, and its body has an odd bump. Even more telling is the unrealistic clarity of the flames in the image, which contrasts with the somewhat blurry and distorted vehicles and other surrounding details.

The inconsistencies strongly indicate that the image is AI-generated rather than an authentic photograph of a real attack on the Ramat David airbase.

DW Fact check conducted an analysis using Truemedia, a nonprofit tool specialized in detecting political deepfakes on social media. The tool's digital analysis uncovered substantial signs of manipulation, which the platform later corroborated by human experts.

Footage of fireworks in Algeria and fire in Indonesia claimed to show Israel under attack
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Claim:** A viral [post](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/x9SDs "External link — post")
 shared on September 22 reads, "_Hezbollah turned Israel to Isra-Hell_," accompanied by a minute-long video. The video is a compilation of several unrelated clips, with sounds of gunfire, sirens, and screaming added throughout the video to create a sense of continuity. The first few seconds show glowing lights illuminating the night sky in a public space, while the second part depicts scenes of chaos, with areas engulfed in flames at night.

The post has been widely circulated in multiple languages, including [English](https://archive.is/gvqGS "External link — English")
, [Arabic](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/bxOb7 "External link — Arabic")
, [Urdu](https://archive.ph/omoFJ "External link — Urdu")
 and [Hindi,](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/Amha5 "External link — Hindi,")
all suggesting the video shows the aftermath of a Hezbollah missile attack on Israel.

A quick search of a screenshot from the video reveals it is old and unrelated to the current tensions. In many cases, fake videos and misinformation can be debunked through a reverse image search.Image: X

**DW Fact check:** False.

A reverse image search of a screenshot from the first part of the clip reveals that the video is not from the recent conflict. It originates from Algeria and shows the [celebrations of the 103rd anniversary](https://archive.is/B6E0I "External link — celebrations of the 103rd anniversary")
 of the Mouloud d'Alger soccer club — not military action.

There are [more videos](https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/vFs3bALRF1 "External link — more videos")
 of the same event online, which show the police officers in uniforms labeled "G.I.P," consistent with those of [Algerian law enforcement.](https://archive.ph/VtzUB "External link — Algerian law enforcement.")
 And these celebrations took place at the beginning of August.

The same applies to other parts of the clips. They are also unrelated to the current conflict between Hezbollah and Israel and have been circulating for at least two years, [previously claiming](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/rD9EW "External link — previously claiming")
 to [show a fire](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/06ytm "External link — show a fire")
 in an Indonesian rural area. 

DW could not verify the exact locations where the videos were filmed. However, the fact that the clips are at least two years old confirms they have no connection to the ongoing hostilities. 

Some clips have been mirrored from original versions, making reverse image searches more difficult and complicating efforts to track down the original sources of the images.

We were unable to track down prior publications for one segment of the clip. 

Footage of Russian oil refinery attack misrepresented as Hezbollah drone strike
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Claim:** "_Hezbollah drones reached the oil refineries in the north of occupied Palestine_," claims a [post on X](https://archive.ph/qP3YN "External link — post on X")
. Hezbollah and other anti-Israeli groups refer to Israel as "occupied Palestine" because they do not recognize it as a legitimate country. Attached to the post is a video purportedly showing a drone flying over an industrial site, striking part of the facility, and exploding. The footage has been shared by numerous accounts on X with similar claims.

This footage has been verified to show a Ukrainian drone strike on a Russian oil refinery in July 2024Image: X

**DW Fact check:** False.

A reverse image search of a screenshot from the video reveals it dates back to the end of July. The footage actually shows a [Ukrainian drone attack on an oil refinery in Tuapse](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/a5NSXybWbWk "External link — Ukrainian drone attack on an oil refinery in Tuapse")
, located in the Krasnodar region of Russia, approximately two months ago.

Hezbollah [has claimed](https://archive.ph/r9iC5 "External link — has claimed")
 it targeted several Israeli military installations on Tuesday, including an explosives factory 60 kilometers (37 miles) into Israel. 

The militant group also reportedly launched a ballistic missile at Tel Aviv. While the Israeli military intercepted the surface-to-surface missile, there were no reports of casualties or damage. This marked the first time a projectile fired from Lebanon had reached central Israel, according to the Israeli military.

However, many images circulating online that claim to show the aftermath of these attacks are fake.

I løpet av det siste året har volumet av manipulert informasjon fra Midtøsten blitt stadig større. Her kan du se hvordan de prøver å lure deg.

Brennende fly, enorme missilangrep og menn uten kjønnsorganer.

Helt siden Hamas-terrorister kjørte over grensen til Israel 7. oktober 2023, har sosiale medier vært fylt med grufulle videoer og bilder fra krigen i Midtøsten.

De dagene krigen er på sitt mest intense, kan mengden av bilder være overveldende, og mengden feilinformasjon som deles har også vokst siden krigsutbruddet.

Konflikten har fått et eget digitalt liv, hvor mange av deltakerne ikke lenger ser ut til å være interessert i å etablere en presis forståelse av hva som skjer. I stedet angriper de bare hverandres synspunkter på nettet.

Og det er nå nesten umulig å fastslå hva som er sant og usant hvis du kun får informasjonen din fra medier som X, Instagram, WhatsApp, Telegram og Facebook.

Hvordan oppdage falskt innhold?
-------------------------------

Hvis du stiller deg selv de riktige spørsmålene, er det mindre sannsynlig at du blir et offer for manipulerte bilder og historier.

Hvem er kilden?

Undersøk hvem avsenderen er. Se hva annet kilden deler, og sjekk om vedkommende vil stå ved informasjonen med navn og ansikt.

Hvorfor ble materialet delt?

Manipulert materiale er ofte designet for å skape en følelsesmessig respons og for å spille på folks fordommer.

Er det tegn på AI?

Bilder generert av kunstig intelligens kan fortsatt ofte avsløres ved å zoome inn på detaljer. Noen ganger mangler detaljer som fingre og tær, eller det er for mange.

Stemmer datoen?

Ser du egentlig på et gammelt innlegg? Sjekk om været, årstid og tid på døgnet stemmer overens med hendelsen som avsender sier bildet er fra.

Hvem delte den først?

Bruk et bildesøkeprogram som Google Lens for å finne ut om andre også deler bildet og i hvilken sammenheng det deles.

Nedenfor har vi samlet fem eksempler på noen av de manipulerte historiene og videoopptakene, der sannheten igjen og igjen blir et av krigens mest involverte ofre.

Skadene til Hizbollah-folket
----------------------------

  ![FEIL: En rekke pro-israelske profiler på X delte disse bildene kort tid etter angrepet. Foto: X / @hamasatrocities](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063502.webp?imageId=17063502&x=1.71&y=1.63&cropw=96.00&croph=95.71&width=675&height=669 "Foto: X / @hamasatrocities")

Da Israel startet sin aksjon mot Hizbollah-militsen i Libanon 17. september 2024, skjedde det med et angrep der militsmennenes personsøkere plutselig eksploderte.

Angrepet drepte 12 mennesker og skadet over 2700, og det tok ikke lang tid før sosiale medier ble fylt med bilder av ofrene og restene av de eksploderte personsøkerne.

Noen av bildene viste til og med – ifølge avsenderne – at flere mannlige Hizbollah-medlemmer mistet kjønnsorganene under eksplosjonene.

  ![FEIL: Ifølge en israelsk soldat som kaller seg Daniel Hanukha på X, er dette skader forårsaket under personsøkerangrepet. Foto: X / @israelifihther](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063525.webp?imageId=17063525&width=978&height=551 "Foto: X / @israelifihther")

FEIL: Ifølge en israelsk soldat som kaller seg Daniel Hanukha på X, er dette skader forårsaket under personsøkerangrepet. Foto: X / @israelifihther

Bildene, som er vannmerket på arabisk, ble delt blant annet av den proisraelske profilen [Hamas Atrocities](https://x.com/HamasAtrocities/status/1837121304517898265)
 med teksten «konsekvenser».

De ble delt av flere israelske soldater, som profilen [Daniel Hanukha](https://x.com/israelifihther/status/1837535641690595627)
, som skrev:

– Israels siste offensiv mot Hizbollah påførte ikke bare fysisk skade, men er også et alvorlig slag for moralen og organisasjonens operative evne. Angrepet etterlot 5000 sårede og 500 i kritisk tilstand, hvorav mange sannsynligvis ikke vil overleve.

Tallene i innlegget er ikke den eneste overdrivelsen.

For ingen av de tre underkroppene på bildene har faktisk noe med personsøkerangrepet å gjøre.

Og hvis du søker etter fotografiene ved hjelp av Google Lens bildesøk, kan du enkelt finne to av dem.

En av dem har allerede blitt delt vidt og bredt i en helt annen sammenheng.

Bildet, der penis tydelig er borte, stammer faktisk fra den 65 år gamle ikke-binære amerikanske arkitekten [Lewin Wertheimer](https://x.com/lewinmodified_)
.

Han gjennomgikk en operasjon i april hvor penis ble fjernet og erstattet med en kunstig vagina, og etter operasjonen delte han stolt bildet på X, mens han holdt de fjernede testiklene i hendene.

  ![KJØNNSSKIFTE: Lewin Wartheimers innlegg på X 10. april 2024, hvor han nettopp har blitt operert. Foto: X / @lewinmodified](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063551.webp?imageId=17063551&x=0.00&y=0.00&cropw=100.00&croph=100.00&width=675&height=675 "Foto: X / @lewinmodified")

Bilde nummer to har heller ingenting med konflikten i Midtøsten å gjøre.  

Bildet av den bandasjerte penisen kommer faktisk fra en japansk profil på [X.](https://x.com/ayanetyaaaaaan/status/1189503012714057729)

Her skriver profilens eier, Ayane, i et innlegg fra 30. oktober 2019 at han hadde en ulykke med en kopp ramennudler og måtte til legen.

  ![SKADE: Innlegget med ramennudlene er fra 2019 og er illustrert av dette bildet. Foto: X / @ayanetyaaaaaan](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063620.webp?imageId=17063620&x=0.00&y=0.00&cropw=100.00&croph=100.00&width=675&height=912 "Foto: X / @ayanetyaaaaaan")

I den tredje underkroppen krever det litt mer innsats for å finne ut hvem personen er.

Et bildesøk gir bare et litt større utsnitt av det samme bildet, og her kan du se en mann som mangler både bein og høyre øye.

Hvis du oversetter den arabiske teksten på det større bildet, ser det ut til at mannen sannsynligvis heter Raja Awida.

Et søk på navnet hans fører til flere artikler i palestinske medier hvor man kan [se bilder](https://english.palinfo.com/Zionist-Terrorism/2024/09/13/325293/)
 av samme mann som mangler høyre øye og begge beina.

  ![FRA GAZA: Foto: Det fremgår av den arabiske teksten at bildet deles for å samle inn penger til en mann Raja Awida. Flere israelske kilder deler også dette bildet som dokumentasjon på skader etter personsøkerangrepet.

Og så kan du lese at han er offer for et israelsk bombeangrep i Gaza og derfor ikke offer for personsøkerangrepet.

Bildene av de påståtte skadene er et godt eksempel på at materiale er tatt ut av kontekst og misbrukt til å fortelle en helt annen historie.

En veldig stor del av de manipulerte historiene som vi i TV 2 Danmark har vært borti på sosiale medier det siste året er av den typen.

Men også kunstig intelligens begynner å bli involvert.

Den ødelagte basen
------------------

  ![KI-BILDE: Bildet her ble delt 23. september 2024, etter at Hizbollah utførte et rakettangrep mot Israel. Foto: X / @drhossamsamy65](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063718.webp?imageId=17063718&x=0.00&y=0.00&cropw=100.00&croph=100.00&width=675&height=743 "Foto: X / @drhossamsamy65")

KI-BILDE: Bildet her ble delt 23. september 2024, etter at Hizbollah utførte et rakettangrep mot Israel. Foto: X / @drhossamsamy65

22\. september 2024 ble Israel utsatt for et stort rakettangrep fra Hizbollah.

Like etterpå gikk bildet ovenfor viralt som «dokumentasjon» på at rakettene hadde forårsaket store skader på militærbasen Ramat David i den nordlige delen av landet.

Bildet ble delt av de propalestinske profilene på X [SilencedSirs](https://x.com/SilentlySirs/status/1837936858652725379)
 og [Dr. Sam Youssef](https://mobile.x.com/drhossamsamy65/status/1838022636841979974)
, og i skrivende stund er den sett over 500.000 ganger.

– Bilde fra Ramat David-basen i det okkuperte Palestina, etter at basen ble rammet av Hizbollahs angrep, skriver SilencedSirs i den medfølgende teksten til innlegget.

Ifølge Dr. Sam Youssef sier bildet ble lekket gjennom israelsk sensur, og ifølge ham beviser det at det er omfattende skader på basen.

Men hva beviser egentlig bildet?

Zoomer du inn, er det flere mistenkelige ting ved motivet.

Flyet har en mystisk pukkel nær haleroret, lastebilen til venstre har en enorm dør, og bilen nederst har to frontender.  

  ![FEIL: Bildet er fullt av tegn på at det ble generert av kunstig intelligens. X / @drhossamsamy65 Foto: X / @drhossamsamy65](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063728.webp?imageId=17063728&x=0.00&y=0.00&cropw=100.00&croph=100.00&width=675&height=783 "Foto: X / @drhossamsamy65")

FEIL: Bildet er fullt av tegn på at det ble generert av kunstig intelligens. X / @drhossamsamy65 Foto: X / @drhossamsamy65

Samtidig er det brennende flyet av en type som ikke eksisterer i virkeligheten, og det ser ut til å være satt sammen av et Hercules-fly og en Boeing 707.

Hvis du blar raskt forbi det falske bildet, kan det være vanskelig å se at det er fabrikkert, og de som ser det uten å ha mistanke om det, kan tro at Israel ble hardt rammet av angrepet fra Hizbollah, selv om bildet ikke dokumenterer noe i den retningen.

Bildet av det brennende flyet tilhører de mer sofistikerte AI-genererte bildene fra konflikten i Midtøsten.

Det brukes ofte mer upraktiske løsninger, hvor gamle bilder er forkledd som nye, eller hvor bildene kommer fra helt andre steder.

Dataspill fra Iran
------------------

  ![SPILL: Ifølge flere pro-iranske kilder på sosiale medier så oppskytingen av de mange missilene slik ut. Foto: Focus Home Interactive / TV 2 DK](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063730.webp?imageId=17063730&x=0.57&y=0.26&cropw=96.00&croph=95.97&width=675&height=905 "Foto: Focus Home Interactive / TV 2 DK")

SPILL: Ifølge flere pro-iranske kilder på sosiale medier så oppskytingen av de mange missilene slik ut. Foto: Focus Home Interactive / TV 2 DK

Israel ble utsatt for et stort luftangrep fra Iran om kvelden 1. oktober, med rundt 200 missiler som utfordret det israelske luftforsvaret, slik at flere av de iranske våpnene kunne slippe gjennom og treffe målene sine.

Under og etter angrepet ble det delt mange spektakulære bilder av missiler på himmelen over Israel – men hvordan så det ut da de ble skutt opp?

Det er spørsmålet den propalestinske X-profilen [Zainabzehra](https://mobile.x.com/ZAINABALI_72/status/1841182994595565706)
 prøvde å svare på til følgerne sine.

Profilen publiserte en video som i skrivende stund er sett 5,4 millioner ganger, og der den tilhørende teksten lyder:

– Iransk stats-TV har nettopp vist dette.

På bildene kan du se hundrevis av mobile utskytningsramper som sender ut så mange missiler at de nesten dekker himmelen.

Men zoomer man inn på de mobile rampene, viser det seg at det er gamle jugoslaviske kjøretøy, som i dag kun brukes av Bosnia, Serbia og Kroatia.

  ! <image:2151>

Hvordan havnet de i Iran?

Det har de ikke.

For når man ser nærmere på bilene, viser det seg at de ikke er ekte.

Bildene kommer faktisk fra dataspillet [Wargame: Red Dragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wargame:_Red_Dragon)
, utgitt av Focus Home Interactive i 2014.

En moské i brann
----------------

Noen av de fabrikkerte videoene og bildene som florerer på sosiale medier, deles ikke nødvendigvis for å lure folk, selv om de ser naturtro ut ved første øyekast.

13\. august [delte](https://x.com/TheTempleMoun/status/1823370869021831312)
 for eksempel den høyreekstreme israelske gruppen Sons of the Temple Mount en video som viser den muslimske helligdommen Al Aqsa-moskeen i flammer.

[https://twitter.com/TheTempleMoun/status/1823370869021831312](https://twitter.com/TheTempleMoun/status/1823370869021831312)

– Absolutt seier, heter det i den tilhørende teksten.

Heldigvis er det et [webkamera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niaaMHL3Mak)
 som peker direkte mot Al Aqsa-moskeen, så det er ganske enkelt å forsikre seg om at helligdommen fortsatt er der.  

Men intensjonen med den naturtro videoen, som ble laget med kunstig intelligens, var nok også annet enn å spre falske nyheter.

Nemlig å provosere.

Videoen har i skrivende stund kun blitt vist noen hundre ganger på gruppens egen profil på X, men til gjengjeld ble den raskt plukket opp av et stort antall palestinske profiler som raser mot den jødiske trusselen.

Videoen har blitt sett rundt 100.000 ganger på propalestinske profiler som [Eye on Palestine](https://x.com/EyeonPalestine/status/1834146323953574201)
, [DOA Muslims](https://x.com/doamuslims/status/1834198658570449027)
 samt den antisionistiske kanalen [Torah Judaism](https://x.com/TorahJudaism/status/1834245765624938637)
.

Og hvis formålet med videoen var å provosere, lyktes det.

For 15. september kunne den israelske avisen [Haaretz](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-09-15/ty-article/.premium/hamas-warns-grave-consequences-after-jewish-extremists-threaten-al-aqsa-mosque-in-video/00000191-f5e0-d570-ab95-fdedbd340000)
 fortelle at den palestinske terrorbevegelsen Hamas advarte om «alvorlige konsekvenser» på grunn av videobildene av den brennende moskeen.  

De «digitale» skyene
--------------------

Ett år inn i krigen er mengden manipulert informasjon i konflikten så alvorlig at selv relativt ubetydelig informasjon nå møtes med mistillit.

For eksempel etter Irans missilangrep mot Israel 1. oktober.

Her har israelerne i ettertid holdt informasjonen om hva iranerne traff tett inntil brystet.

Så langt har ikke Israels militære publisert noen bilder av mål som er truffet, og pressen har ikke tilgang til de berørte basene.

Derfor ventet lenestolekspertene på internett, som følger krigen tett, lenge på at det skulle komme nye satellittbilder etter angrepene.

Men da de kom, var det en skuffelse.

[Den anonyme X-profilen Ayden](https://x.com/squatsons/status/1841548683566821424)
 publiserte 2. oktober et satellittbilde av en av de israelske basene som var målet for det iranske angrepet, og her er det ikke mulig å se basen på grunn av skydekket.

[https://twitter.com/squatsons/status/1841548683566821424](https://twitter.com/squatsons/status/1841548683566821424)

Ayden publiserer sin egen analyse av materiale fra konfliktområder til sine 149.000 følgere, og profilens eier konkluderte med at skyene var digitalt plassert slik at publikum ikke kan se ettervirkningene av angrepet.

I skrivende stund har den oppsiktsvekkende påstanden blitt sett 1,7 millioner ganger på Aydens profil alene.

Påstanden ble også umiddelbart plukket opp av en rekke propalestinske [profiler](https://x.com/ShaykhSulaiman/status/1841533871587836034)
 som den britiske journalisten Sulaiman Ahmed, som delte det som et faktum med sine 598.000 følgere på X.

– Breaking. Israel legger falske digitale skyer over Nevatim-basen. De vil ikke at du skal se skadene, skrev han.

Det er imidlertid ingen indikasjoner på at satellittbildene har blitt manipulert.

Det var spredt skydekke over store deler av Israel de dagene de ble tatt.

På bildet med de «digitale skyene» kan man se en brå overgang mellom bakke- og skydekke, men dette er fordi bildet er en mosaikk bygd opp av bilder fra ulike satellittpasseringer til forskjellige tider.

Påstanden om at Israel utplasserte digitale skyer for å dekke over skadene varte ikke mer enn noen få dager, og det er nå offentlig tilgjengelige satellittbilder som viser skader og kratre i bakken ved den israelske basen.

An excavator removes a charred car in Kiryat Bialik in the Haifa district of Israel following a Hezbollah attack \[Jack Guez/AFP\]

Hezbollah has announced that it launched dozens of rockets at Israel’s Ramat David Airbase, east of Haifa, in response to a series of [Israeli attacks](/news/2024/9/19/lebanese-people-talk-about-fears-after-pager-and-walkie-talkie-explosions)
, prompting the UN to war of an “imminent catastrophe” if the tit-for-tat violence continues.

Sirens were activated across northern Israel in the early hours of Sunday.

If confirmed, the assault would be Hezbollah’s farthest-reaching attack inside Israel since the start of the ongoing cross-border clashes in October last year.

The Israeli military said more than 100 projectiles were fired early on Sunday from Lebanon, forcing hundreds of thousands to take cover and prompting school closures in Israel’s north.

Educational activities would not be permitted across northern Israel until at least Monday at 6pm (15:00 GMT), the military’s Home Front Command said, affecting “hundreds of thousands of children”, according to military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Nadav Shoshani.

“In Haifa, a lot of schools are closed … and offices are empty,” said resident Patrice Wolff, who works in the medical industry.

The Israeli military also issued restrictions on large gatherings in northern Israel, including Haifa – the country’s third-largest city.

There were no reports of casualties or any significant damage by rockets in Israel on Sunday.

On Saturday, the Israeli army said it carried out hundreds of air raids across southern Lebanon. It also claimed attacks on 110 other locations in the early hours of Sunday morning.

In a statement issued by his office on Sunday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged that Israel “inflicted a series of blows” against Hezbollah.

“If Hezbollah has not understood the message, I promise you, it will understand the message.”

Meanwhile, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant vowed that Israeli operations against Hezbollah will continue until residents of northern Israel can return home safely.

‘Imminent catastrophe’
----------------------

The latest violence could lead to an “imminent catastrophe” in the Middle East, the United Nations special coordinator for Lebanon, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, warned on Sunday, saying a military solution was not the answer.

“With the region on the brink of an imminent catastrophe, it cannot be overstated enough: there is NO military solution that will make either side safer,” she said in a post on X.

Reporting from Beirut, Al Jazeera’s Ali Hashem also highlighted the significance of the Lebanese group’s attack.

“This is the first time since the 2006 war \[between Israel and Hezbollah\] that Hezbollah’s missiles crossed” 20km (12 miles), Hashem said.

“This is the first time that they’re hitting targets towards 45km \[30 miles\], 50km \[31 miles\], because we’re hearing reports of impacts or interceptions in several areas, including above the Ramat David Airbase to the east of Haifa.”

Al Jazeera’s Zeina Khodr, also reporting from Beirut, said Hezbollah’s message is that despite the blows that they have received in the past few days, “it’s still able to fight and launch rockets and missiles across the border”.

In its statement, Hezbollah said it carried out the attack with so-called Fadi 1 and Fadi 2 rockets, not the World War II era, Soviet-made Katyusha rockets that it has been using over the past several months.

The latest barrage of rocket fire comes after a week of Israeli attacks across Lebanon.

On Tuesday and Wednesday, wireless [communication devices](/news/2024/9/18/chk_exploding-pagers-psychological-warfare-israels-attack-on-hezbollah)
 associated with Hezbollah exploded across Lebanon, injuring thousands and killing dozens, including civilians. Hezbollah has said it is not seeking an all-out war, but it is ready for one should it occur.

Israeli leaders have promised to push Hezbollah off Israel’s border and return its citizens to communities in the north, including through war if necessary.

Death toll in Beirut strike rises
---------------------------------

Israel also conducted an air strike in the southern suburbs of Beirut on Friday that [killed at least 45 people](/news/2024/9/21/death-toll-from-israeli-strike-on-beirut-suburb-rises-to-31)
 and injured dozens more.

Senior Hezbollah commander Ibrahim Aqil was among those killed in the attack that levelled an entire residential building.

Hezbollah and Israel have engaged in daily clashes since the outbreak of the Israeli war on Gaza.

The Lebanese group says it will continue its attacks on Israeli bases in the north of the country until Israel ends its Gaza offensive.

The violence has displaced tens of thousands of people on both sides of the border.

Hezbollah launched dozens of rockets at an Israeli military base in the northern region of the country on Sunday, as Israel and the militant group continue to exchange fire amid escalating tensions in the Middle East.

The militant group said the attack, which targeted the Ramat David airbase, near the northern city of Haifa, was “in response to the [repeated Israeli attacks](https://www.politico.eu/article/senior-hezbollah-commander-killed-in-israeli-strike-on-beirut/)
 that targeted various Lebanese regions and led to the fall of many civilian martyrs," the Associated Press [reported](https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-rocket-attack-mideast-tensions-0584727974096d98d1b5b132dfd1d218)
.

"We have entered a new phase, the title of which is the [open-ended battle of reckoning](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/hezbollah-israel-exchange-heavy-fire-after-deadly-israeli-strike-2024-09-22/)
," Hezbollah deputy chief Naim Qassem said on Sunday.

Israel Defense Forces [confirmed](https://x.com/IDF/status/1837680273405702296)
 on social media that "large areas of northern Israel are being targeted by Hezbollah’s rockets." It was unclear whether there were any casualties.

The attack came after a massive Israeli air strike on the Lebanese capital Beirut [killed](https://www.politico.eu/article/senior-hezbollah-commander-killed-in-israeli-strike-on-beirut/)
 at least 37 people on Friday, including a top Hezbollah military commander.

These missile and rockets exchanges are just [the latest escalations](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/20/israel-hezbollah-escalation-00180299)
 in the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah militants, which are fanning fears of a wider war in the region. Israel earlier [said](https://x.com/IDF/status/1837501170182483984)
 it launched a series of airstrikes targeting Hezbollah missile launchers in southern Lebanon.

"In recent days, we have inflicted a [series of blows](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/netanyahu-examining-siege-plan-hamas-north-gaza-israeli-media-report-2024-09-22/)
 on Hezbollah that it never imagined," Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a [video statement](https://x.com/netanyahu/status/1837815933340971071)
 on Sunday. "If Hezbollah has not understood the message, I promise you, it will [understand the message](https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-says-hezbollah-will-get-the-message-after-strikes-it-never-imagined/)
."

Hezbollah last week [blamed](https://www.politico.eu/article/lebanon-hezbollah-injured-by-exploding-pagers/)
 Israel for two waves of attacks where the explosion of [pagers](https://www.politico.eu/article/lebanon-hezbollah-injured-by-exploding-pagers/)
 and other [communications devices](https://www.politico.eu/article/lebanon-second-wave-tech-pager-explosions-beirut-nabatieh-tyre-saida/)

Content: "<image:6675>!Reuters A distressed-looking woman draped in an Israeli flag holds another person (20/02/25) <image:6676>Reuters

Israelis gathered at Hostages Square in Tel Aviv mourned the return of the bodies

On a bleak late winter's day, under leaden skies and occasional driving rain, this was the moment all Israelis had been dreading.

The return of the dead.

It began, as all the handovers so far have begun, with a politically charged display by Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups involved in holding Israeli hostages for over 500 days.

Once again, there was a stage, flanked by huge posters highlighting the catastrophic consequences of Israel's military campaign in Gaza and the Palestinian determination to stay put.

But instead of haunted, sometimes emaciated, survivors, there were four black coffins, each bearing a photograph and a name – Oded Lifschitz, Shiri Bibas and her two young sons, Ariel and Kfir - accompanied by the image of Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.

Missile casings bore the slogan: "They were killed by US bombs". In a rare public statement on the matter, they had urged Hamas to conduct the handover in a private, dignified fashion.

Their efforts had clearly been in vain, but they attempted to screen the coffins from public scrutiny, draping each one in a white sheet before driving them away.

The watching crowd was smaller than usual, perhaps because of the heavy rain.

After Thursday morning's handover, at a military ceremony on the edge of the Gaza Strip, the coffins carrying the hostages were draped with Israeli flags and prayers offered by the army's chief rabbi.

A convoy of vehicles then made its way north towards the Abu Kabir forensic institute, in Jaffa, where formal identification of the bodies is taking place.

Along the route, small groups of Israelis stood silently in the rain, carrying Israeli flags and yellow banners - the colour associated with the hostages and their supporters.

In Karmei Gat, where displaced members of kibbutz Nir Oz are living, waiting to go home, the vigil was particularly sombre.

All four of Thursday's released hostages were seized from Nir Oz on 7 October 2023.

Tel Aviv's Hostages Square was a study in grief, with people crying or sitting on the ground, heads in hands.

The faces of the red-headed Bibas boys - Ariel and Kfir - are plastered on walls, road signs and in windows up and down the country. <image:6675>!EPA Red Cross vehicle drives through lines of Palestinians in Khan Younis, Gaza (20/02/25) <image:6678>EPA

Some Gaza expressed bitterness that bodies of Israelis had been released

Meanwhile, back in Gaza, some Palestinians expressed their anger that Israeli bodies had been handed over, while an unknown number of Palestinians killed in Israel's military campaign remain buried in the apocalyptic wreckage of the Gaza Strip.

In addition, as many as 665 bodies are being held by Israel in numbered cemeteries, according to a Palestinian protest group, The National Campaign to Recover the Bodies of the Martyrs.

Return of bodies marks day of anguish for Israel
================================================

! Hamas has long argued that all four were killed by Israeli air raids on Gaza, something which has not been verified.

As previously, Red Cross officials were on hand to oversee the process. Fearing the worst, Israelis have nevertheless clung to the hope that the brothers might have survived, along with their mother, Shiri.

"We were devastated by the news," Orly Marron said, outside Abu Kabir.

"I have red-headed grandchildren and seeing the photographs is really very heartbreaking."

Oded Lifschitz's son, Yizhar, meanwhile told Israel Radio that he had always feared for his father's health, since his violent abduction in October 2023.

Oded was 84 years old at the time. Israel allowed the equipment to enter, in exchange for Thursday's handover and the release of six more living hostages this coming Saturday.

Protesters demanding a deal freeing hostages in Gaza gather around 27 mock coffins at Tel Aviv's Habima Square on September 5, 2024. (Noam Lehmann/Times of Israel)

About 300 people are marching from Tel Aviv’s Habima Square to the IDF headquarters on Begin Street to demand a ceasefire deal in Gaza to free hostages, kicking off a fifth straight night of protests after the IDF said Sunday it had recovered the bodies of six Israelis in Hamas hands slain days earlier.

The group carries 27 mock coffins, representing 27 hostages killed in captivity in Gaza.

Speaking ahead of the march, Gil Dickmann, whose cousin Carmel Gat was one of the six slain hostages whose remains were recovered over the weekend, accuses Netanyahu of “sentencing my cousin to death.”

Some members of the crowd shout: “Murderer!”

“She was abandoned to her death by a government that could have saved her,” Dickmann says, noting the number of days she was held captive. [Skip to main content](#main-content)

! It is [a move that other Jewish and Israeli events have made](https://www.jta.org/2024/03/18/ny/to-evade-pro-palestinian-protests-some-jewish-and-israeli-events-are-keeping-their-locations-low-profile)
 to evade pro-Palestinian protests during the war in Gaza.

“It is deeply unfortunate that after enduring the horrific June 1 firebomb attack that resulted in the death of a community member, participants now face such persistent harassment that they must keep their gatherings secret to simply stay safe,” [tweeted](https://x.com/ADLMtnStates)
 the Anti-Defamation League of the Mountain States.

Boulder City Council member Tara Winer, who is Jewish, told 9News that she had been marching with the group several weeks ago but decided to leave after experiencing the antisemitic chants.

“I have to deal with the agitators every two weeks, if not more, and my weekend is my weekend, so I did not want to have to stand there and listen to that again,” Winer told 9News, referencing the open comment at City Council meetings. (Chet Strange/Getty Images)

The Boulder, Colorado chapter of Run For Their Lives, the Israeli hostage awareness event that was firebombed in June, will no longer publicize its demonstrations after weeks of continued threats, including from a local political candidate.

“​​Participants are facing a level of harassment that makes it impossible to continue safely in public view,” Brandon Rattiner, senior director of the local Jewish Community Relations Council, said in a statement.

The Boulder march, one of [more than 230 chapters](https://www.jta.org/2025/06/05/israel/run-for-their-lives-the-israeli-hostage-solidarity-movement-presses-on-after-colorado-firebombing)
 around the world held weekly to draw attention to the Israeli hostages being held by Hamas in Gaza, was attacked on [June 1](https://www.jta.org/2025/06/01/united-states/multiple-people-injured-in-boulder-colorado-attack-on-demonstration-for-israeli-hostages)
 by a man who threw Molotov cocktails at participants. Thirteen people were injured and [one 82-year-old woman later died](https://www.jta.org/2025/06/30/united-states/boulder-firebombing-victim-karen-diamond-82-dies-of-her-injuries)
.

The man accused of the attack, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, was arrested at the scene and indicted on [12 hate crime counts](https://www.jta.org/2025/06/26/united-states/man-who-firebombed-boulder-march-for-israeli-hostages-indicted-on-hate-crime-charges)
.

Since then, anti-Israel counter-demonstrators have targeted the group, according to local Jewish leaders. Protesters have called Run For Their Lives participants “genocidal c–t,” “racist,” and “Nazi,” and mentioned the lead organizer’s children, according to videos reviewed by JCRC.

Video posted to social media by a pro-Palestinian counter-demonstrator show clashes. This individual’s comment in no way reflects the views of Run For Their Lives.” The group also said the woman accused of having made the comment did not in fact make it and that she had faced threats as a result of the video.

Aaron Stone, who is running for Boulder City Council, has been one of the more vocal counterprotesters, and allegedly called Rachel Amaru, the founder of the Boulder chapter of Run for Their Lives, a “Nazi,” according to [CBS Colorado](https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/boulder-marchers-attacked-location-walks/)
.

Amaru told [9News](https://www.9news.com/article/news/local/boulder-run-for-their-lives-group-antisemitism/73-0decca37-c088-4d6e-b200-c8f827705026)
 that “100% I’m being attacked because I’m Jewish,” adding that, “calling a Jew in Boulder right now a ‘Nazi’ is so over the top.”

When asked if he regretted calling Amaru a “Nazi,” Stone told CBS Colorado that he agreed “it is a very strong word to use.” But he defended protesting against the group.

“I’m not seeing a Jewish person,” Stone said. Yes, absolutely.”

The BBC News article from February 20, 2025, discusses the return of Israeli hostages' bodies, including Oded Lifschitz, Shiri Bibas, and her two sons, Ariel and Kfir (<image:6675>, <image:6676>, <image:6678>). The Times of Israel published an article on September 5, 2024, about a protest in Tel Aviv where protesters carried 27 mock coffins to represent hostages killed in Gaza, which includes the image in the claim (<image:49>). The JTA article from August 29, 2025, discusses the relocation of an Israeli hostage awareness event in Boulder, Colorado, due to harassment.



## Elaboration
The claim is inaccurate. The image depicts a protest in Tel Aviv on September 5, 2024, where protesters carried mock coffins to represent hostages killed in Gaza, not dead Israeli soldiers. The image was taken by GALI TIBBON and is available on Getty Images.


## Final Judgement
The image shows mock coffins used in a protest in Tel Aviv on September 5, 2024, representing hostages killed in Gaza, not dead Israeli soldiers. The image is from a protest and not from a reburial ceremony.

`false`

Why did Barcelona reverse its decision to cut ties with Israel?
===============================================================

In-depth: In February, Barcelona broke off ties with Israel, citing the systematic violation of Palestinian human rights. Seven months later, and with a new mayor in office, the twin city agreement with Tel Aviv has been restored.

On 1 September, the new mayor of the city of Barcelona - Jaume Collboni - signed a decree suspending a [decision by the previous administration](https://www.newarab.com/news/barcelona-cuts-ties-israel-over-palestinian-rights)
 to halt a twinning agreement with Tel Aviv and cut ties with Israel.

The initial decision in February to suspend relations represented a huge milestone for solidarity with Palestine from [city councils](https://www.newarab.com/analysis/how-local-politics-europe-driving-change-palestine)
 around the world.

After progressive Mayor Ada Colau declared it would cease cooperation with Israel and support Palestinians, other cities joined the call, such as the [Belgian city of Liege](https://www.brusselstimes.com/475641/city-of-liege-votes-to-boycott-the-state-of-israel)
 in April and [Brazil’s Belem](https://www.newarab.com/news/brazilian-mayor-declares-city-apartheid-free-zone)

The move came after a campaign by more than a hundred civil society associations which, a few months after being launched, had not just reached but [surpassed](https://twitter.com/proucomplicitat/status/1603728347774816256)
 the number of signatures they needed for the request to be presented to the city council. 

After being approved, a [letter signed by dozens of prominent figures](https://www.lavanguardia.com/local/barcelona/20230214/8755440/cuatro-premios-nobel-medio-centenar-personalidades-internacionales-apoyan-ruptura-barcelona-israel-colau-tel-aviv.html)
, including four Nobel Prize winners and musicians, actors, and intellectuals from around the globe, praised the decision.

But just seven months on and following a contested May election campaign which saw the leader of the centre-left Socialist Party Jaume Collboni obtain a majority in the city council, the tide has turned.

**Legal harassment against institutions and activists**

On the same day that Ada Colau announced the temporary suspension of Barcelona’s twinning agreement with Tel Aviv and its ties to the state, the pro-Israel group ACOM - Action and Communication for the Middle East - [announced](https://a-com.es/acom-anuncia-acciones-legales-contra-ada-colau-y-el-ayuntamiento-de-barcelona-por-su-discriminacion-antisemita/)
 it would take legal measures against the mayoralty’s alleged “hate agenda and its unhealthy obsession against Jews and their state”. 

ACOM, founded in 2004, is the largest of a series of groups that claim their objective is to fight “discrimination against Jews and harassment towards Israel and its citizens”.

Although [self-defined](https://a-com.es/dossier/)
 as a secular and independent entity – reportedly supported by the help of civil society and private donors – the organisation is part of an umbrella of international [pro-Israel groups](https://a-com.es/somos-acom/)
 ranging from MEMRI, the Israeli Allies Foundation, and other influential groups in the United States and beyond.

“ACOM has engaged in intimidating activists and city councils since the Spanish Solidarity Network Against the Occupation of Palestine launched its Apartheid Free Spaces campaign back in 2015,” a Spanish activist and academic who requested anonymity due to a history of reprisals by these groups told _The New Arab_.

As ACOM details in its [press releases](https://a-com.es/acom-presenta-recurso-legal-contra-ayuntamiento-de-barcelona/)
, legal actions by the group have resulted in the annulation of 86 institutional agreements in solidarity with Palestine, and in 2016, ACOM’s sister association sought the prosecution of [eight activists](https://law4palestine.org/spain-acquits-8-bds-activists-of-hate-crimes-against-us-jewish-singer-matisyahu/)
 that called for the boycott of Jewish-American reggae artist Matisyahu at the Rototom Sunspalsh Festival, accused by a local BDS group of supporting Israel’s occupation.

In Barcelona, these groups carried out a huge legal campaign against the former mayor and her team, referring complaints to the [administrative courts](https://a-com.es/acom-presenta-recurso-legal-contra-ayuntamiento-de-barcelona/)
 and launching criminal proceedings for alleged hate crimes.

Marc Serra, a councillor in Barcelona’s city council and part of Ada Colau’s party ‘Barcelona En Comú’, told _The New Arab_ that despite the first complaint being filed, these groups have tried to use different legal pathways to achieve their objective.

“There is a pattern in which they file complaints in the courts, in the public prosecutor's office, in the national audience… until they find a judge who ends up agreeing with them or at least opens a way to investigate”.

As a lawyer himself, Serra claims that “we can talk about it as an abuse of the judicial system”. He adds that “what they have achieved is what they were looking for, the opening of criminal proceedings against the Mayor of Barcelona, who took a stand against apartheid towards the Palestinian people, as well as questioning any authority that could take a similar stand”.

**The Socialist Party and renewing ties**

For new Mayor Jaume Collboni and his team, the decision to renew Barcelona’s ties with Israel was not economically driven nor influenced by any interest group, according to officials.

Pau Solanilla, city promotion commissioner under Collboni’s administration and the person who announced the move, told _The New Arab_ that “there has been no pressure or encouragement because it was not necessary, we have been clear that dialogue, cooperation and city diplomacy are useful instruments to contribute to peace in the region”. 

On the same day that Ada Colau broke ties, Jaume Collboni [visited Barcelona’s synagogue](https://www.elperiodico.com/es/barcelona/20230215/maragall-llama-jaume-ii-provocador-83017210)
 to declare that, were he to be elected Mayor, he would reverse Colau’s decision. Yet, only two months later, the facts speak for themselves,” they said.

A man with a Palestinian flag pictured during a protest in Barcelona in 2015. “I think it is a very serious thing that these associations are using the discourse on human rights and the fight against discrimination after having ties with the extreme right, which is the one that goes against fundamental rights”.

In his official X account, and on behalf of his party, the city councillor also [reminded the Spanish public](https://twitter.com/MarcSerraSole/status/1697649555452440667)
 of the dangers to fundamental rights within Israel itself.

“Collboni has decided to "embrace" Israel when the state is going through its worst democratic crisis: governed by the far right, with a judicial reform that undermines the separation of powers and an increase in violence against the Palestinian population,” he wrote.

> "The signal being sent to Israel following Barcelona's recent decision is that 'everything is fine, and that there will be no retaliation for the daily and repeated violations against the Palestinians'"

**Impunity for Israel's occupation**

For Pau Solanilla, who speaks for his party’s recent decision to renew ties, the composition of Israel’s far-right government is concerning. They added that, “these crumbs do not provide a political solution to the Palestinian cause".

Israeli forces have killed at least [219 Palestinians](https://www.ochaopt.org/data/casualties)
 since the beginning of 2023 in the occupied West Bank, East Jerusalem, and Gaza Strip, making it the deadliest year since the UN began recording deaths in 2005.

For Laurent Cohen, a Jewish member of the Catalan Association of Jews and Palestinians, the signal being sent to Israel following Barcelona’s recent decision is that “everything is fine, and that there will be no retaliation for the daily and repeated violations against the Palestinians”. 

**Bianca Carrera is a freelance writer and analyst specialising in Middle Eastern and North African politics, as well as environmental matters, at Sciences Po Paris. Some days later, the party also headed a [proposal to re-establish ties](https://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/ca/mandat-2019-2023/accio-de-govern/el-consell-municipal/acords-del-plenari/35184)
 in a council plenary session. He made clear that the move was on his agenda, but associations claim they were not told it would be a priority within his mandate. 

The group that was behind Barcelona’s solidarity campaign with Palestine, ‘Prou Complicitat’, or ‘Enough Complicity’, told _The New Arab_ that Collboni’s Socialist Party later met with the Palestine solidarity movement.

“In this meeting, they acknowledged that their reaction to the suspension was hasty and that they overreacted. \[Getty\]

**Pro-Israel interest groups and the Spanish right**

ACOM was founded in 2004 by businessman David Hatchwell, and is now presided over by the CEO of the international insurance company AmTrust Europe, Angel Mas."

Following the end of Barcelona's twin-city partnership with Tel Aviv earlier in February by Mayor Ada Colau, the Spanish soccer team FC Barcelona sent a statement of support for Israel on Thursday.

The president of the Barcelona football club, Joan Laporte, decided to convey a message of support for Israel after Colau cited claims that Israel was guilty of “[apartheid](https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/international/europe/1674201215-barcelona-to-vote-on-severing-ties-with-tel-aviv-over-israeli-apartheid "https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/international/europe/1674201215-barcelona-to-vote-on-severing-ties-with-tel-aviv-over-israeli-apartheid")
" as well as “flagrant and systematic violation of human rights.” The choice was made less than a year after [Barcelona's](https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/international/europe/1675943226-barcelona-s-mayor-against-twinning-her-city-with-tel-aviv "https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/international/europe/1675943226-barcelona-s-mayor-against-twinning-her-city-with-tel-aviv")
 twinning program with St. Petersburg was stopped in opposition to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Laporte invited the representatives of the Israeli Embassy in Spain to the soccer match against the Manchester United team as part of the European League and to give the embassy representatives Barcelona shirts.

 left-wing Colau’s decision, with only her party voting in support.

On Thursday, the president of FC Barcelona invited representatives from Israel’s embassy to Spain to the soccer match against England’s Manchester United, in a sign of support for the Jewish state, according to a statement from the Israeli mission.

The statement said Joan Laporta stressed during a ceremony before the game that his team — which is popular among many Israelis — has long been committed to having good ties with Israel.

“The gesture of the Barcelona soccer team joins the wave of protests in Barcelona, Catalonia and all of Spain against the mayor’s decision,” the embassy said.

MADRID — The Spanish government on Friday criticized a decision by Barcelona’s mayor to cut the city’s ties with Israel, calling it a “unilateral move” that would not bring “anything good.”

In a letter last week to Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week, Barcelona’s leftist mayor Ada Colau said she had taken the step due to Israel’s “systemic violation” of the rights of the Palestinian population.

Colau, a former anti-eviction activist, cited several Israeli policies including its construction of settlements on lands claimed by the Palestinians for a future state.

“It would be a severe mistake to apply a policy of double standards and turn a blind eye to a violation that has been, for decades, widely verified and documented by international organizations,” she added.

The largely symbolic measure, which had been requested by dozens of local groups, includes the end of a twinning agreement with Tel Aviv.

Speaking at an event in Barcelona on Friday, Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares called the move a “unilateral decision, and I understand an almost personal decision, by the mayor.”

“I believe that Barcelona’s vocation is to be an open city, as Spain is,” he added.

“I do not believe that anything good is achieved by suspending, cutting, expelling, nor is a dialogue built between Israel and Palestine,” he added.

After Colau announced last week she was suspending the twinning agreement, Madrid’s conservative Mayor José Luis Martínez-Almeida accused her of antisemitism and tweeted that he has written to Tel Aviv’s Mayor Ron Huldai to share “Madrid’s commitment to democracy and freedom.”

### Evidence from `web_search`
FC Barcelona's president, Joan Laporte, invited representatives from the Israeli Embassy in Spain to a soccer match and was presented with an Israeli flag as a sign of support for Israel, according to an i24NEWS article from February 16, 2023 ([https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/israel/diplomacy/1676623454-barcelona-soccer-team-sends-message-of-support-for-israel](https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/israel/diplomacy/1676623454-barcelona-soccer-team-sends-message-of-support-for-israel)). The Times of Israel also reported on this event ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/spanish-fm-swipes-at-barcelona-for-cutting-ties-with-israel/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/spanish-fm-swipes-at-barcelona-for-cutting-ties-with-israel/)).

The image in the claim (<image:52>) appears to be the same as the one in the i24NEWS article (<image:6691>).


# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that the image shows FC Barcelona's president, Joan Laporta, with representatives from the Israeli Embassy. This event occurred on February 16, 2023, not in September 2024. The evidence also does not confirm whether the Gaza war was ongoing at the time of the meeting.

Therefore, the claim is inaccurate regarding the date and the context of the Gaza war.

Screenshot of the false post, taken August 22, 2024

The posts emerged online after the United States [urged](https://www.barrons.com/news/us-urges-israel-to-probe-video-of-prison-sex-abuse-6316ea67)
 Israel to investigate and implement accountability following the circulation of a video that appeared to show soldiers sexually abusing a Palestinian prisoner on August 7 ([archived link](https://web.archive.org/web/20240822070528/https://www.barrons.com/news/us-urges-israel-to-probe-video-of-prison-sex-abuse-6316ea67)
).

The leaked surveillance video, broadcast on Channel 12, showed Israel soldiers hiding behind shields in what online commentators suggested was sexual acts performed on a prisoner the Sde Teiman base.

The Israeli military said it has opened an [investigation](https://www.barrons.com/news/israel-army-opens-probe-into-suspected-abuse-of-detainee-cf341d85)
 into “suspected abuse” of a detainee at the facility, known to be holding Palestinians arrested from Gaza during the war ([archived link](https://perma.cc/JAJ6-FJ6U)
).

Channel 12 hosted a [controversial debate](https://www.the7eye.org.il/526413)
 on August 7 in which panellists discussed whether the rape and abuse of Palestinian prisoners should be legalised ([archived link](https://perma.cc/A49R-S47W)
).

The war was triggered by Hamas’s unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians, according to an [AFP tally](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20240903-israel-pm-unbowed-by-pressure-as-gaza-war-rages-on)
 based on Israeli official figures ([archived link](https://web.archive.org/web/20240904021154/https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20240903-israel-pm-unbowed-by-pressure-as-gaza-war-rages-on)
).

Israel’s retaliatory military campaign to destroy Hamas has killed 40,819 people, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.

The altered image was shared on Facebook by users based in [Malaysia](https://web.archive.org/web/20240822013834/https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fzinnirahmuthalif%2Fposts%2Fpfbid023SwxWmk3NXhVA2xDdnruaXAqhSAH7y6FNtfppVPESkD7YZbhuyLyJ2n5nEcHWexNl&show_text=true&width=500)

A reverse image search on Google found the [original footage](https://www.mako.co.il/news-channel12?subChannelId=b91e54300a2ef710VgnVCM200000650a10acRCRD&vcmid=622e1dba8a601810VgnVCM200000650a10acRCRD)

).

The two-minute, six-second video shows an anchor presenting the news alongside the survey results that read in Hebrew: “Do you agree with the claim that the government relies on supporters of terrorism?”

The video’s Hebrew-language title translates to English as: “A year for the government: a survey of mandates”.

The timestamp for the clip screenshot used in the misleading post can be seen at the one-minute 46-second mark.

In the manipulated image, a blue box covered the screen, hiding the original question that was displayed with the results on a screen behind the news anchor.

Channel 12 subsequently apologised for the poll, Israeli newspaper Haaretz [reported](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-10-02/ty-article/.premium/leading-israeli-news-channel-apologizes-for-terror-supporters-poll/0000018a-f13e-dfa2-a99e-f97fd6ea0000)

 on August 11.

The image appeared to show a news presenter from Israel’s Channel 12 standing next to a poll graphic with a Hebrew-language question that translates as: “Do you agree that a soldier is allowed to rape a “terrorist”?”

Various X users later claimed the image was a doctored version of a 2022 Channel 12 poll, which asked respondents about the Israeli government's relationship with "terrorist supporters."

WASHINGTON (TND) — Rep. Erakat's now-deleted X post contained a doctored image of a poll seemingly conducted by Israel's Channel 12, according to [screenshots](https://x.com/yashar/status/1821337704711516313 "https://x.com/yashar/status/1821337704711516313")
 shared by users. Tlaib trusted me & posting this \[without\] cross checking was my mistake."  

"But surely u understand how one would take this poll to be true in light of video of gang rape of a Palestinian detainee & Knesset + public debate on whether such rape should be ok," she added. "THAT is the disgrace, Alex."  

When reached for comment, Erakat reiterated to TND that it is "not a leap or a stretch" to believe such a poll would have been published by Channel 12. She noted the image circulated shortly after video was released of an alleged gang rape of a Palestinian prisoner by Israeli soldiers at detention facilitySde Teiman.

State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller on Wednesday called for an investigation related to the video, emphasizing claims of sexual abuse atSde Teiman are "horrific." Israel's Supreme Court has repeatedly convened to consider closingthe facility.

Erakat told TND it is "devastating" for Palestinian-Americans to see such footage, adding both a lack of media coverage and the outrage she and Rep. <image:6699>](https://komonews.com/game-center#/games/guessword)

65% of Israeli Jews oppose criminal prosecution for soldiers suspected of raping Palestinian detainees
======================================================================================================

A shocking new poll shows that almost two out of three Jewish Israelis oppose criminal prosecution for soldiers suspected of gang-raping Palestinian detainees at the Sde Teiman torture facility.

A shocking [poll](https://www.inss.org.il/he/publication/august-2024/)
 published on August 18 by the Israeli Institute for National Security Studies surveys attitudes concerning various aspects of what Israel calls “Swords of Iron” — the genocide of the last ten months and counting. 

The poll asks, among else, how people would want to handle the soldiers suspected of [gang-raping Palestinian detainees at the Sde Teiman torture facility](https://mondoweiss.net/2024/08/israeli-medias-coverage-of-the-rape-of-palestinian-detainees-shows-support-for-sexual-violence-in-service-of-genocide/)
 if it turned out that the suspicions were strong. It confirms what we saw last week when Israeli journalist Yehuda Shlezinger lamented on Israel’s mainstream Channel 12 [how gang rape is not an approved and regulated policy](https://mondoweiss.net/2024/08/israeli-medias-coverage-of-the-rape-of-palestinian-detainees-shows-support-for-sexual-violence-in-service-of-genocide/)
 in Israeli detention centers. 

That figure, 65%, also echoes the February [poll](https://mondoweiss.net/2024/02/over-2-3-of-jewish-israelis-oppose-humanitarian-aid-to-palestinians-starving-in-gaza/)
 saying that 68% of Jewish Israelis  “oppose the transfer of humanitarian aid to Gaza residents at this time,” even if Hamas or UNRWA were out of the picture in terms of distribution. 

The same INSS poll citing the 65% opposing criminal prosecution of the gang rapists incidentally cites an identical percentage of Israeli Jews as having “high trust” in the reports of the military spokesperson “throughout the war in Gaza” — an institution which generates incessant [genocide propaganda](https://mondoweiss.net/2024/03/the-real-reason-israel-stormed-al-shifa-hospital-yet-again/)
. There, they only offer a data tracker on six points, but it doesn’t include the Hebrew survey with its 23 points. 

So this is yet another unbelievable data point — gang rape as a weapon of war is not considered criminal by two out of three Jewish Israelis when it’s Israeli soldiers doing it to Palestinians (in the much-publicized gang rape case, the victim happens to be a civil servant, a policeman for the drug control department in Jabalia). 

When it comes to Palestinians, the blanket suspicion of affiliation with Hamas generates a rationale for revenge by which Palestinians are assumed to be involved with sexual violence, and when we speak about “disciplinary measures” here, it is not just systemic torture and sexual violence, it also reaches the level of murder through torture. Two-thirds of Jewish Israelis are saying that there is simply nothing criminal here — only “bad behavior,” at worst. 

And this seems to strengthen the pattern that has been documented: not only do Israelis seem to generally enjoy watching [snuff videos](https://mondoweiss.net/2024/03/we-are-the-masters-of-the-house-israeli-channels-air-snuff-videos-featuring-systematic-torture-of-palestinians/)
 of this systemic torture — they generally support the sexual violence, including rape, that has accompanied it. In addition to wishing a “regulated policy” of rape existed in Israeli prisons, Shlezinger also advocated that the “terrorists” be “executed according to law.” And he shared that belief during his _apology_ for his rape advocacy.

It is a whole other world of impunity for Israeli soldiers. 65%, almost two out of three Jewish Israelis, opposed criminal prosecution, and would prefer them be “handled in a disciplinary manner, by the commanding level only.”

The survey asked the question:

> “Recently, the military prosecution requested to extend the arrest of the five soldiers suspected of gross abuse, and clarified that there is added evidence which strengthens the suspicion against them. In your opinion, if it turns out that there is basis for the suspicion against the suspects, in which way should they be handled?” 

Only 21% of Jewish Israelis answered that “they should stand criminal trial”; 14% of Jewish Israelis didn’t know.  

It is now clear, that the torture of Palestinians in this network of torture camps is systemic, as also documented by B’tselem in their report “[Welcome to Hell: The Israeli Prison System as a Network of Torture Camps](https://www.btselem.org/press_releases/20240805_welcome_to_hell)
.” High brass is involved in this, so the idea that the gang rapists would be disciplined by their own commanders is tantamount to letting them off the hook. They can trust the military to protect the rapists. 

The full INSS survey in Hebrew is not on the [English version](https://www.inss.org.il/publication/war-data/)
 of the site. There is almost nothing they can do to Palestinians that the Jewish Israeli public would consider criminal, and hardly any Israelis would consider them “human animals” for thinking like that. 

_Correction: The story originally incorrectly said that “28% of Jewish Israelis answered that ‘they should stand criminal trial.'” The correct percentage is 21%. The story has been updated._

Content: "(Ayal Margolin/Flash90)

Israel is “ready to support” Lebanon’s efforts to disarm Hezbollah and will implement a phased reduction of its military presence in Lebanon as a “reciprocal measure,” the Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement on Monday.

If the Lebanese Armed Forces “take the necessary steps to implement the disarmament of Hezbollah, Israel will engage in reciprocal measures, including a phased reduction of IDF presence in coordination with the US-led security mechanism,” the statement reads.

“Israel stands ready to support Lebanon in its efforts to disarm Hezbollah and to work together towards a more secure and stable future for both nations,” it continued.

The comments issued by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office come nine months after Israel and Lebanon reached a ceasefire deal following a year of cross-border fighting that escalated in September 2024 before the agreement was signed in November. On Monday, Hezbollah leader Naim Qassem reaffirmed the group’s refusal to disarm.

The Prime Minister’s Office statement praised leaders in Beirut for their “momentous decision,” calling the move “a crucial opportunity for Lebanon to reclaim its sovereignty and restore the authority of its state institutions, military, and governance—free from the influence of non-state actors.”

The statement came a day after top US envoy Tom Barrack, accompanied by US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, reportedly met in Jerusalem with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other senior officials to discuss Syria and Lebanon.

Barrack said in Beirut last week that [Israel should honor its commitments](https://www.timesofisrael.com/us-envoy-israeli-withdrawal-from-lebanon-next-step-as-beirut-agrees-to-disarm-hezbollah/)
 under a November 2024 ceasefire, in light of Beirut’s decision to work toward Hezbollah’s disarmament.

“I think the Lebanese government has done their part. Israel has maintained a military presence in five key points in southern Lebanon and continues to strike Hezbollah targets in the country.

On Monday, alongside the comments from Netanyahu’s office, a Hezbollah operative was killed in an Israeli drone strike in the southern Lebanon town of Tebnine, the military said.

According to the IDF, the operative was involved in restoring Hezbollah military infrastructure in the nearby town of Beit Lif, which the IDF called a violation of the ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon. <image:6710>](https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/08/AFP__20250807__692M8AA__v1__HighRes__LebanonIsraelConflictHezbollahArms-1.jpg)

Supporters of Lebanon’s Hezbollah terror group block the streets with burning tires as they rally in cars and motorbikes to protest the government’s endorsement of a plan to disarm it, in Beirut’s southern suburbs, early on August 8, 2025. The US also reportedly pressed Israel to consider withdrawing from one of five outposts the IDF has established inside Lebanon.

Under the November 2024 truce agreement, weapons in Lebanon were to be held only by the state, and Israel was to fully withdraw its troops from the country; however, Israel has remained in those five outposts, and Hezbollah has refused to disarm.

In his Monday speech, Qassem said that the Lebanese government must first ensure Israel complies with the November ceasefire before talks on a national defense strategy can take place. Sign in to stop seeing this](//crm.timesofisrael.com/sign-in)

Netanyahu says attacks on Hezbollah in Lebanon ‘not the end of the story’
=========================================================================

This article is more than 1 year old

Israeli air raids on rocket sites are part of dangerous rise in hostilities, increasing fears a major conflict could erupt

Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed that Israeli air raids targeting Hezbollah rockets in southern Lebanon in the early hours of Sunday morning were “not the end of the story”, after the two sides [exchanged their heaviest fire](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/25/israel-hezbollah-attacks-what-we-know-so-far)
 since the war in Gaza began, raising fears of an all-out regional conflict.

The Israeli prime minister did not specify what further action, if any, was planned after the intense exchanges but he suggested Israel’s moves would be aimed at “changing the situation in the north”.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) used 100 jet fighters that [hit more than 40 target sites inside Lebanon](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/25/israel-pre-emptive-strikes-lebanon-huge-hezbollah-drone-and-rocket-attack)

----------- Hezbollah launched hundreds of rockets and drones at Israel.

According to Netanyahu, the raids “destroyed thousands of short-range rockets, all of which were designed to attack our citizens and our forces in the Galilee” in northern Israel.

He also said the IDF had “intercepted all of the drones that [Hezbollah](https://www.theguardian.com/world/hezbollah)
 launched at a strategic target in the centre of the country”.

Netanyahu did not name the target but the Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, described it as “a military intelligence base 110km inside Israeli territory” just outside Tel Aviv, an apparent reference to the Glilot military base, home to the Mossad spy agency and military intelligence agencies such as the Unit 8200 electronic surveillance section.

Two [Hezbollah](https://www.theguardian.com/world/hezbollah)
 fighters and a militant from an allied group were killed in the strikes on Lebanon. “And I reiterate – this is not the end of the story.”

Military observers in Israel believe that some IDF generals and the defence minister, Yoav Gallant, are in favour of further sorties against Hezbollah military positions following Sunday’s apparent success.

Moment of strike in Lebanon as Israel and Hezbollah exchange heavy fire – video

Gallant told IDF officers that Hezbollah had been thrown off balance by pre-emptive Israeli action minutes before the Lebanese militia was due to launch its rocket and drone attack.

“We have destabilized Hezbollah, and their operation failed,” he said, according to [Haaretz newspaper](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-08-25/ty-article-live/idf-launches-wave-of-lebanon-strikes-as-israel-braces-for-major-hezbollah-escalation/00000191-8715-d632-add9-b7778aa50000?liveBlogItemId=373173373#373173373)
. He added that all the drones involved had been successfully launched and had entered Israeli airspace, but did not say how many, if any, had reached their intended target.

The Hezbollah secretary general claimed the Lebanese Shia militia had decided not to respond to the [killing in late July of its commander](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/30/beirut-suburbs-hit-in-airstrike-targeting-hezbollah-commander-israel-says)
, Fuad Shukr, with attacks on Israeli civilians or infrastructure but to focus on exclusively military targets.

He added that Hezbollah’s arsenal of guided missiles had not been used and had not been damaged by Israeli airstrikes, so could be used in the future. Israel’s foreign minister, Israel Katz, also stressed his country did not want an all-out conflict, though it would “act according to developments on the ground”.

[Map](https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/08/israel_lebanon_strikes-map/giv-13425f8aHmj5xK1D8/)

However, Netanyahu’s government is under persistent political pressure to create conditions in northern Israel for 80,000 displaced residents to return to their homes. They had been driven out by Hezbollah rocket and artillery fire in solidarity with Hamas, after the Palestinian militant group launched its surprise attack on Israel on 7 October last year.

“Nasrallah in Beirut and \[Iranian supreme leader\] Khamenei in Tehran need to know that this is an additional step in changing the situation in the north, and returning our residents securely to their homes,” Netanyahu told a cabinet meeting on Sunday. He argued that Israel was at a “strategic crossroads” between possible negotiated solutions to the conflict in Gaza and the confrontation with Hezbollah in [Lebanon](https://www.theguardian.com/world/lebanon)
.

“We need to use the negotiations to bring about the release of hostages, and through the release of the hostages, also open the possibility of creating a resolution in the north, and later, to calm the region,” the defence minister said.

Meanwhile, Israel was “operating militarily and preparing as if we will not reach a resolution, and we are ready at any moment for war in the north, whatever may come”, Gallant said. The French press agency AFP quoted an unnamed US military official as saying that Washington had helped track incoming Hezbollah attacks but “was not involved in Israel’s pre-emptive strikes”.

Gallant’s office reported that the minister had talked by phone to the UK defence secretary, John Healey, to brief him on the pre-emptive airstrikes and the thwarted Hezbollah attack.

“Minister Gallant discussed the important cooperation with Britain in ensuring Israel’s security,” the ministry statement said. An Israeli navy officer was killed and two other service members injured on a patrol boat off the coast of northern Israel that was hit by shrapnel from an Iron Dome interceptor missile.

On Sunday evening the armed wing of Hamas said that it had fired an “M90” rocket at Tel Aviv in response to what it said was the “Israeli massacres against civilians”.

The IDF said sirens sounded in Rishon LeTsiyon, about 15 miles south of Tel Aviv, but the rocket landed “in an open area”.

A Hamas official also said on Sunday evening that it rejected new Israeli conditions put forward in [Gaza](https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza)
 ceasefire talks, casting further doubt on the chances of a breakthrough in the latest US-backed effort."

War with Hezbollah was inevitable, given the Sword of Damocles it held over Israel’s head, but, as in the case of Gaza, Netanyahu was risk-averse.

His security doctrine rested on deterrence — managing the threat rather than eliminating it — because an all-out war was expected to bring massive destruction and thousands of civilian casualties. Hoping to avert a wider war, the president convinced Netanyahu to call off the attack (Netanyahu denied the report).

Hezbollah intensified its bombardment with rockets that Iron Dome could not intercept, forcing tens of thousands of Israelis in more than 40 communities along the border to evacuate. 11, which “could have changed the course of the war” and “eliminated all the chain of command of Hezbollah immediately.” However, Netanyahu opted for delay.

Even that success did not end the fighting. By year’s end, Hezbollah had fired 15,400 rockets.

As he would repeatedly, Netanyahu chose placating his right-wing coalition members over working with former President Joe Biden by rejecting a cease-fire proposal the Americans had coordinated with Israel. I said it because I firmly believe that the Lebanese people do not want war and can no longer bear its consequences or even the language of war.”

In August, Lebanon’s government decided to decommission Hezbollah’s weapons and assert full sovereignty over Southern Lebanon for the first time in more than 50 years.

Yet Hezbollah vows to resist. Most damning, as in Gaza, he misled Israelis into believing that “total victory” was possible.

A [photo published on X](https://archive.is/0PvDl)
 (formerly Twitter) claiming to show Israeli Prime Minister (PM) Benjamin Netanyahu being surveilled by Iran from inside his office is ALTERED.

The post alleges that Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) captured and published the image, accompanied by a warning reading, “Do not test our capabilities — we intend to keep you living in a state of constant anxiety!”

However, a reverse image search revealed that the photo has [been online](https://archive.is/JmjZG)
 since 2019 and was not shared by IRGC in 2025, as the post claims.

Furthermore, a Yandex image search showed that the photo was [edited](https://www.malumatfurus.org/netanyahu-makam-odasi/)
 to make it appear as though Netanyahu was under surveillance. The [original image](https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/in-this-handout-photo-benjamin-netanyahu-head-of-the-right-news-photo/84719768?adppopup=true)
, taken on 8 February 2009, in Jerusalem, shows Netanyahu with his father, Ben Zion Netanyahu.

A FotoForensics Error Level Analysis (ELA) reveals that the photo has been altered, as indicated by inconsistencies and noise in the image.

PesaCheck has looked into a photo on X (formerly Twitter) claiming to show Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu being surveilled by Iran from inside his office and finds it to have been ALTERED.

The first phase of the war, he [writes](https://twitter.com/netanyahu/status/1710796924092129517)
 on X, involves “destroying most of the enemy forces” that have infiltrated into Israel and have killed civilians and soldiers.

Israel has also begun an offensive into Gaza “and it will continue without hesitation and without respite – until the goals are achieved.”

“We will restore security to the citizens of Israel and we will win,” he writes.

A senior Biden administration official says on a call with reporters that the US “will treat Hamas for what they are. They are an international terrorist organization.”

Washington’s focus is currently on “ensuring that the Israelis have what they need to respond appropriately,” says the official.

The White House official says the US is ready “to offer all appropriate means of support to the people and government of Israel.”

“Israel has a right to defend itself and its people. Full stop.”

“We remain deeply aligned,” said the official, adding that Israel’s response is likely to continue “for some time.

The official says that that US will continue to “work with parties throughout the region” to make sure the fighting doesn’t spread from Gaza.

The official also speaks about the potential of a normalization deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia, saying that it is “premature to say the impact” that the war will have on those efforts.

“That process has a ways to travel,” says the official, adding that “terrorist groups like Hamas will not derail any such outcome.”

In a statement to Hamas’s Al-Aqsa TV, the terror group’s military spokesman Abu Ubaida claims that the number of hostages taken into Gaza is “many times greater than what Netanyahu thinks,” and that they are being held in various locations throughout the coastal strip.

The spokesman also urges Israel not to make “miscalculations,” adding that “whatever happens to the people of the Gaza Strip, will happen to \[the hostages\].”

Israel is now facing a deep crisis after witnessing the heroism of Hamas militants, Abu Ubaida says, adding that Israeli soldiers fell before them “like locusts.”

He vows that Hamas will continue the ongoing operation on all fronts.

The Israel Defense Forces says that earlier today it struck two “operational infrastuctures” in Gaza that were housed inside mosques and were being used by Hamas to direct terror toward Israel.

The IDF slams Hamas for using “holy sites” and exploiting the civilian population in the Gaza Strip.

Maj.-Gen. (retired) Noam Tibon describes to Channel 12 going to Kibbutz Nahal Oz and, together with IDF troops, “saving my family” whose home was surrounded by terrorists from Gaza.

He tells Channel 12 that the troops killed several terrorists and rescued his son and grandchildren.

His son, Amir, a journalist for Haaretz, posts on the social media platform X that his “heroic” father came from Tel Aviv, “led the troops” to the family’s home and “helped kill the terrorists.”

Amir also praises his daughters for staying quiet in the house for hours before they were rescued. “We are praying for the neighbors who are missing and injured.”

Eleven Nepalese agricultural students have been injured, two of them seriously, in the Hamas attack on southern Israel, according to a statement by the Nepalese Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Nepal’s ambassador to Israel tells CNN that when the attack began, the students were working on a farm in the area. They hid in a bomb shelter but that building was taken over by Hamas.

Separate unconfirmed reports in the Hindustani Times and India Today state that some Nepalese students are also among those who have been taken hostage by Hamas.

The Israel Defenses Forces provides details on a number of airstrikes it carried out in the Gaza Strip in the last few hours.

The IDF says it carried out a drone strike on a rocket launcher, and killed two terrorists standing next to it.

In other drone strikes, a terror cell was hit while attempting to infiltrate into Israel via Zikim beach, and another cell was hit while trying to infiltrate from central Gaza, the IDF says.

Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan speaks with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to urge a halt to the violence in and around Gaza.

A Saudi Foreign Ministry statement says the two discussed “the necessity of working toward an immediate halt to the escalation.”

Prince Faisal emphasizes “the kingdom’s rejection of the targeting of civilians and the need for all sides to respect international humanitarian law.”

The Saudis have been in talks with the White House over potentially forging diplomatic relations with Israel, efforts which have now been thrown into question.

Germany and France move to reinforce security around Jewish temples, schools and monuments after the surprise attack by Hamas against Israel.

Germany tightens police protection of Jewish and Israeli institutions, as some supporters of the Palestinians took to the streets of Berlin to celebrate the attack.

France is focusing on Jewish temples and schools in cities across the country, as one Jewish leader expresses concern at the possibility the conflict might be imported there.

“In Berlin, police protection has been immediately stepped up,” Germany’s Interior Minister Nancy Faeser tells Bild newspaper. “The federal government and the regions are closely coordinating their actions.”

Germany’s authorities are also closely watching “potential supporters of Hamas in the Islamist sphere,” she adds.

In France, security had already been stepped up at synagogues in Paris, Marseille, Lyon and Strasbourg because of the holiday period being observed since late September.

Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin sends an urgent message to prefects running the country’s regions asking them to reinforce surveillance even further.

“At a time when terrorist attacks from Gaza are hitting Israel, I ask you to immediately step up vigilance, security and protection of Jewish community sites in France,” he writes in a message seen by AFP.

He called for a “visible and systematic static presence,” and the use of soldiers from France’s Operation Sentinelle, a special force deployed across the country since the 2015 terror attacks. The interior ministry will review the security situation at a special meeting tomorrow.

#### [Hamas official: Our attack has only just begun](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/hamas-official-our-attack-has-only-just-begun/)

By [Gianluca Pacchiani](https://www.timesofisrael.com/writers/gianluca-pacchiani/ "Gianluca Pacchiani")

Hussam Badran, a member of the political bureau of Hamas, says the terror group’s onslaught is only in its early stages.

Badran says the attack, called the “Al-Aqsa Deluge” by the terror group, comes after careful preparation aimed at catching Israel by surprise.

The terror leader says this battle is different from all previous rounds of conflict, and calls on Arab mediators to convey to Israel that it must “leave our occupied lands.”

He adds that Hamas does not expect them to be mediators but rather supporters of its position.

Like a number of Hamas leaders who have issued statements today, Badran claims the attack is motivated by Israeli control over the flashpoint Al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem.

The mosque, the third holiest site for Muslims, sits atop the Temple Mount, the holiest site for Jews as the location of the biblical temples. Israel has long maintained a delicate status quo at the site, in which Jews are allowed to visit during limited hours, but not pray. Terror groups have repeatedly used baseless claims of Israeli intentions to take over the mosque as a pretext for violence.

Badran also blames Israeli policies in the West Bank and its treatment of Palestinian prisoners for the attack, adding that “we are the owners of this land, and this occupation will not last forever.”

The surprise onslaught against Israel has killed at least 250 Israelis, including many civilians, and injured over 1,000. An unspecified number of Israelis, living and dead, are held hostage by terrorists in Gaza.

By [AFP](https://www.timesofisrael.com/writers/afp/ "AFP")

Irish deputy premier and foreign affairs minister Micheal Martin condemns the attack by Hamas on Israeli citizens, and says it is “vital that the voice of moderation comes to the fore.”

Martin says he could “see tensions rising” during a recent trip to the region, and that the scale of today’s attack is “quite shocking.”

“We believe a two-state solution remains the only sensible and rational solution to this issue and it needs political momentum behind it,” he says.

“My sense is that the hardliners are growing in influence, and that’s why I believe the need to have moderate voices in the center is key,” he says.

“So what we need really is a political peace process to get on track in a serious way. That will mean I think, international intervention as well to facilitate that, but it’s a very, very complex and difficult situation and there will be many consequences to today’s attack.”

Israel’s courts will operate on an emergency footing tomorrow and will only hold hearings on urgent matters due to the Hamas invasion of southern Israel and the war with Gaza, it announces.

A statement put out by the Israel Courts Administration says the decision was made by Justice Minister Yariv Levin “with the knowledge of and \[in accordance with the\] opinion of Supreme Court President Justice Esther Hayut and Director of the Courts Administration Judge Michael Spitzer.”

The decision applies to Israel’s magistrates, district and labor courts, as well as the Supreme Court and the rabbinical courts.

Hearings scheduled for parole committees on Sunday will be postponed to a later date.

The statement condemns “the recent unprovoked and continuous attacks by Israel on Palestinian towns, cities, and refugee camps” as well as “the inhumane siege imposed on the nearly 2 million inhabitants of Gaza,” which the organization says is “an implied declaration of open war on the Palestinians which oblige them to be in constant self-defense.”

The organization calls on the US government “to exert pressure on the occupation regime to immediately cease these atrocities” and criticizes any Arab and Muslim nations that have normalized relations with Israel.

According to the US State Department, Blinken calls “on all leadership in the region to condemn” the Hamas attacks on Israel, and also urges the PA to “enhance steps to restore calm and stability in the West Bank.”

Today in Ramallah, Abbas chaired an emergency leadership meeting of the Palestinian Authority, and according to the official news agency Wafa, “gave instructions to provide protection for the Palestinian people, stressing the right of the Palestinian people to defend themselves against the terrorism of settlers and the occupation forces.”

Abbas also “gave directions to provide all that is necessary to bolster the resilience and steadfastness of the Palestinian people in facing the crimes committed by the Israeli occupation and settler gangs.”

Netanyahu says the army is currently clearing Hamas terrorists from everywhere they infiltrated, going house to house, “restoring control to our hands.”

He sends love and condolences to all the bereaved families that lost loved ones “brutally murdered in cold blood.” He prays for the recovery of the injured.

And he warns Hamas that Israel will hold it responsible for the hostages it has taken. “Israel will avenge anyone who is harmed,” he says, “in so much as a hair on their head.”

He says Israel stands in solidarity with residents of the south, who stood firm and fought bravely.

He praises the security forces, calling them the latest in the long history of Israel’s war heroes.

“You are fighting now for all of our homes, for all of our futures,” he says.

“We are all with you, we all love you, we all salute you.”

He praises the members of the emergency services, and says their spirit will help overcome our enemies.

He says he spoke with President Biden and other world leaders from France, Britain and beyond, thanks Biden for his “unreserved support,” and says he secured international backing for “freedom of action” for Israel.

Netanyahu says all Israelis “are in this together. It will take time. It will be hard. We have challenging days ahead of us.”

But he promises that “with God’s help, with our combined strength, and with our belief in an eternal Israel, we will win.”

In an address to the nation, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vows to use “all the power” of the IDF to destroy Hamas’s capabilities, and tells Gaza’s residents to “get out now.”

Calling today’s events something “never before seen in Israel,” he vows to ensure “it will never happen again.”

He begins by saying Hamas “invaded Israeli territory this morning,” and started a “cruel and evil war,” targeting innocent civilians young and old.

“We will win this war, but the price will be unbearably heavy,” he says.

“Hamas wants to murder us all,” Netanyahu says, “murdering children and mothers in their homes, in their beds.

“It is an enemy that kidnaps elderly people, children, young girls,” an enemy “that massacres and slaughters our civilians, our children, who simply wanted to enjoy the festival.”

“What happened today has never been seen before in Israel and I will ensure it never happens again. The entire government supports this decision. The IDF will immediately use all its power to destroy Hamas’s capabilities,” he says. “We will fight them to the bitter end and avenge this black day they plotted for Israel and its people.”

Israel will target Hamas everywhere — turning the places it “hides and operates” into “cities of ruin.”

He tells the “residents of Gaza” to “get out now because we will operate everywhere and with full force.”

New York State and New York City police have stepped up their protection of Jewish communities and synagogues, Governor Kathy Hochul says.

There are no known threats to New York Jews, she says, adding that local authorities are in touch with the FBI and other federal partners after the terror onslaught in Gaza.

Jewish security organizers have also said there are no known threats to US Jews, but are urging vigilance.

The death toll from the Hamas terror group’s massive attack on Israel rises to more than 250, Hebrew-language media reports say, citing medical officials.

The toll is expected to continue to rise.

At least 1,450 have been wounded, many seriously.

Dozens of civilians as well as IDF soldiers are believed to have been abducted and brought into Gaza; the IDF has confirmed that soldiers and civilians have been taken hostage, but has not specified a number.

Thousands of rockets have been fired at the south and center of the country, killing a number of people.

US President Joe Biden backs Israel’s right to self defense, warns other parties in the region against joining the attack against the Jewish state, and says he is in contact with leaders around the region.

“Today the people of Israel are under attack orchestrated by a terrorist organization, Hamas. In this moment of tragedy, I want to say to them and to the world and to terrorists everywhere, the United States stands with Israel. We will not ever fail to have their back, we’ll make sure that they’ll have the help their citizens need and they can continue to defend themselves,” Biden says in a broadcast, while flanked by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken.

“The world has seen appalling images of thousands of rockets in a space of hours raining down on Israeli cities… Hamas terrorists crossing into Israel, killing not only Israeli soldiers but Israeli civilians in the streets, in their homes, innocent people murdered, wounded, entire families taken hostage by Hamas, just days after Israel marked the holiest of days on the Jewish calendar. It’s unconscionable.”

“Israel has the right to defend itself and its people, full stop. There’s never justification for terrorist attacks and my administration’s support for Israel’s security is rock solid and unwavering.”

“This is not a moment for any party hostile to Israel to exploit these attacks to seek advantage. The world is watching.”

“It’s also a terrible tragedy on a human level, hurting innocent people, seeing the lives that have been broken by this, the families torn apart. It’s heartbreaking.”

Biden says he has spoken to the king of Jordan and members of Congress, and told his national security team to engage with their Israeli counterparts for military, diplomatic and intelligence cooperation to “make sure Israel has what it needs.”

Biden has directed his team to be in constant contact with leaders around the region, including in Saudi Arabia, the Palestinian Authority, Turkey, Egypt, Qatar, Oman, the UAE and Europe.

He says he will remain in close contact with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whom he spoke to earlier today.

“Let there be no mistake, the United States stands with the State of Israel,” Biden says.

Magen David Adom names the senior paramedic and ambulance driver who was killed this morning as Aharon Haimov.

He died after being shot in an MDA ambulance by Palestinian terrorists as he was on his way to treat victims in his hometown of Ofakim as the coordinated attack on Israel by Hamas from Gaza unfolded.

Haimov was a 25-year-old married father of two. He also leaves behind parents, siblings and an extended family.

Haimov began his career with MDA as a post-high school volunteer. He later joined the organization in a professional capacity as an emergency medicine paramedic and ambulance driver.

In a statement, MDA says that Haimov always performed his duties in an exemplary way and was the first to respond to emergency events.

“He was a person who put the good of others and the value of life ahead of everything else — including today, on this tragic morning,” says MDA director-general Eli Bin.

Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has decided to extend an emergency situation to the entire State of Israel, his office says.

Earlier, Gallant declared the “special situation” within a range of 80 kilometers from the Gaza Strip.

The “special situation” allows the military’s Home Front Command to restrict gatherings and close off areas.

By [Luke Tress](https://www.timesofisrael.com/writers/luke-tress/ "Luke Tress")

The UN Human Rights Council official tasked with investigating the Israeli-Palestinian conflict refrains from condemning Palestinian terrorists after they launch a devastating surprise attack on Israeli civilians and soldiers.

UN special rapporteur for the Palestinians Francesca Albanese says, “I unequivocally condemn attacks on civilians. Whoever launches them.”

“Today’s violence must be put into context. Almost six decades of hostile military rule over an entire civilian population… are in themselves an aggression,” Albanese says. Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005.

Albanese has a history of antisemitism and tends to place sole blame for the conflict on Israel, which she views as a “colonial” entity.

The US, Israel and other authorities have demanded her removal due to her bias, but the UN has not taken any action against her.

Martin Griffiths, UN under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, also hedges in his condemnation of terror.

“I am extremely alarmed by the rapidly escalating events in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory. The number of civilian casualties on both sides is reportedly already in the hundreds,” he says. “Violence is never the answer. I appeal to all sides to stop the fighting immediately and protect civilians everywhere and at all times.”

The UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker Türk, condemns the terror attacks.

“I am shocked and appalled at reports this morning that hundreds, possibly thousands, of indiscriminate rockets have been fired by Palestinian armed groups towards Israel, and that at least 22 Israelis have been killed and hundreds injured,” Türk says.

More recent figures indicate at least 200 Israelis have been killed, over 1,400 wounded, and others taken hostage.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and Tor Wennesland, the UN’s special coordinator for the Middle East peace process, both issue condemnations of the terror attacks.

By [Jessica Steinberg](https://www.timesofisrael.com/writers/jessica-steinberg/ "Jessica Steinberg")

Hersh Goldberg-Polin, 23, hasn’t been heard from since 8:11 a.m. this morning, when he sent two messages to his parents: “I love you” and “I’m sorry.”

At the time, Goldberg-Polin’s parents, Jon Polin and Rachel Goldberg, didn’t understand the cryptic meaning of the message.

They’d last seen Hersh at 11 p.m. the previous night, after he attended Simhat Torah holiday services with them at their local Jerusalem synagogue and then joined them for dinner with family friends.

“He had a backpack and left at around 11 to join his friend,” said Polin, who didn’t know anything specific about his son’s plans.

The family is religiously observant and doesn’t usually use phones on Shabbat, but after Polin came home early from synagogue Saturday morning, the two reached out to a good friend of their son’s who confirmed that Goldberg-Polin was at an all-night “nature party” near Kibbutz Re’im.

The community is close to the Gaza Strip, in an area where Hamas terrorists attacked civilians, including at the party.

Within several hours, photos of handwritten lists began circulating on social media with the names of party attendees and the locations where some had escaped to, Polin says.

“One list said Yishuv Saad, and his name was on that list, and then it was on the Ofakim list,” Polin says. “But he wasn’t at any of those places.”

Friends were at the couple’s home all day, calling and checking with people they knew in each location, but Goldberg-Polin and his friend haven’t been found anywhere. They called hospitals in the south, including Soroka and Barzilay, without any success.

The Jerusalem police are involved, Polin says, and are taking responsibility for reporting the two missing young men to all police units. Pictures of Polin-Goldberg and his friend are also being circulated on social media.

“They think there’s still a bunch of people hiding in the area,” Polin says, adding that the mother of his son’s friend is inclined to drive down south to look for them, but he advises against it, having heard that roads are closed. “Every time we hear information, we turn over everything we can to find out anything. There’s very little we can actually do.”

The Israel Defense Forces says it struck another two high-rise towers in the Gaza Strip, used by Hamas.

The “Palestine” building was used by a number of Hamas units, including intelligence, weapon production, and offices of senior members, the IDF says.

Another office building served as the headquarters of Hamas’s general security, the IDF says.

Earlier today, the IDF hit two other multistory buildings in the Gaza Strip that the military says housed Hamas assets.

Hamas commander Saleh al-Arouri (YouTube screenshot)

In an interview with Al Jazeera, Saleh al-Arouri, deputy head of the political bureau of Hamas, calls the terror group’s onslaught against Israel an “open battle” aimed at achieving the liberation of the Palestinian people and their holy places, following the perceived “desecration” of the Temple Mount in Jerusalem — known as the Al-Aqsa compound to Muslims — by Jewish worshipers over the holiday of Sukkot.

Al-Arouri alleges plans by Israel to impose an unspecified “new reality” at the flashpoint site after the holiday. Hamas has repeatedly accused Israel of seeking to alter the sensitive status quo at the holy site as a pretext for violence.

Al-Arouri adds that Palestinian detainees in Israeli jails are “about to be freed,” anticipating the liberation of security prisoners in exchange for dozens of Israeli hostages the group has reportedly taken, including both civilians and soldiers.

Al-Arouri says some of the Israeli hostages are “senior officers.” He falsely says Hamas does not kill or harm civilians, claiming that there are videos showing how the terror group treats civilians “humanely.” Hamas terrorists slaughtered civilians in southern Israel today, took others captive, and fired hundreds of rockets at civilian population centers.

“We have a plan for all stages of this conflict,” al-Arouri says, “both in case of an Israeli request for a ceasefire, and in case of a continuing escalation of the violence. We are prepared for all options.” He adds that an Israeli ground invasion would be the “best scenario” for Hamas.

Al-Arouri also expresses his “hope and trust” that Palestinians outside Gaza will join the fight “to defend Al-Aqsa,” especially terror groups in the West Bank. Al-Arouri is considered the de facto leader of Hamas in the West Bank.

“We entered this battle not just for a few hours. We entered it knowing that there will be consequences, and we have no choice but to fight it to achieve our high goals,” he says.

He adds that Hamas is in communication with international and regional parties, and implies that it has received offers for mediation. He also accuses the US of providing financial and military aid to Ukraine but neglecting Palestinians.

Al-Arouri touches on the possible participation of Hezbollah in the attack on Israel, saying Israel is right to fear violence on the Lebanese front in the north, claiming that Israel occupies part of Lebanon’s territory.

Yair Lapid (L), Benny Gantz (C) and Benjamin Netanyahu (R) (Flash90)

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu proposes that opposition parties Yesh Atid and National Unity enter an emergency government following Hamas’s devastating surprise attack Saturday morning.

Netanyahu makes the offer during a meeting with Yesh Atid leader Yair Lapid and National Unity party leader Benny Gantz held earlier today, saying such a government would be the same in format as the Levi Eshkol government then-opposition leader Menachem Begin joined before the Six Day War in 1967.

Gantz says he is considering entering such a government for the duration of the war but insists that government would “deal with security challenges alone” and in a manner that would allow “substantive partnership and influence over decision-making in relevant forums” for his party.

The National Unity party leader tells Netanyahu that regardless, the current government will receive full backing “for any responsible and determined security action.”

Lapid said earlier this evening that he would join “a reduced, professional, emergency government” and says it would be impossible to manage a war with “the extreme and dysfunctional composition of the current cabinet,” essentially calling on the prime minister to remove the far-right Religious Zionism and Otzma Yehudit parties from the government in order for him to bring his Yesh Atid party into the coalition.

The death toll from the Hamas terror group’s massive attack on Israel rises to more than 200, Hebrew-language media reports say.

The toll is expected to rise higher.

At least 1,100 have been wounded, many seriously.

Hundreds of Hamas gunmen infiltrated into Israel this morning, crossing at multiple points and overwhelming what the IDF considered to be the highly sophisticated border fence.

Hamas claims to have abducted dozens of Israelis to Gaza; the IDF has confirmed that soldiers and civilians have been taken hostage, but has not specified a number.

Thousands of rockets have been fired at the south and center of the country, killing a number of people.

The Hamas rocket barrage on central Israel a short while ago has wounded at least nine civilians, medics say.

The Magen David Adom ambulance service said in Rishon Lezion, medics treated two men aged 28 who were seriously hurt.

In Yavne, a 73-year-old woman was seriously hurt and a 77-year-old man was lightly hurt, MDA says.

In Bat Yam, a 24-year-old man was moderately hurt, MDA says.

In Tel Aviv, four people were wounded, including one in moderate condition, MDA adds.

The victims are being taken to hospitals in the area.

Hamas claimed to have launched 150 rockets from the Gaza Strip at Tel Aviv in the barrage.

A coalition of organizations behind the anti-judicial overhaul protests announce a general aid effort for residents of Israeli communities near the Gaza border, including hosting for citizens fleeing the fighting, transportation services, equipment logistics, assistance from mental health professionals, and more.

“At this difficult hour for our brothers and sisters in the south and the entire Jewish nation, the protest organizations are putting their complete organizational infrastructure and logistical capabilities toward the aid and support of the residents in the line of fire,” the organizations say in a social media notice.

The organizations also call for a freeze on all protest activities until further notice and said that while the “gigantic failure” of the security establishment in regards to the surprise Hamas attack must be addressed, “at this time all efforts must be directed toward aid of the southern residents, IDF soldiers and security forces.”

The White House slams a Republican “disinformation” campaign blaming the Biden administration for today’s Hamas attack on Israel.

Prominent Republican lawmakers as well as former president Donald Trump have claimed the US deal to release hostages from Iran gave Tehran access to funds that it is using to support Hamas.

“Not a single cent from these funds has been spent, and when it is spent, it can only be spent on things like food and medicine for the Iranian people,” says White House National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson.

“These funds have absolutely nothing to do with the horrific attacks today and this is not the time to spread disinformation,” she adds.

Magen David Adom thanks the Israeli public for its huge response to the call for blood donations for treating war victims at Israel’s hospitals. Thousands of units of blood were donated at the many MDA donation sites around the country.

As of 7:30 p.m. on Saturday, MDA says it has enough blood supply for the time being and has asked people to hold off on donating until tomorrow or later in the week.

At Ichilov Hospital in Tel Aviv alone, 650 individuals showed up to donate blood. Overwhelmed by the turnout, Ichilov announced that it had closed its blood donation station until further notice.

Israel’s Ambassador to the UN Gilad Erdan sends a letter to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and Sérgio França Danese, the Brazilian diplomat who holds the Security Council presidency this month, calling on the Security Council to immediately condemn Hamas.

“It is now time for the international community including the Security Council to unequivocally condemn the appalling terror attacks carried out by Hamas and all terrorist organizations against the civilians of Israel,” Erdan writes.

“Israel expects and demands the solidarity and support of all those in the international community who oppose this barbaric terrorism and the targeting of innocent men, women and children for slaughter. It will not tolerate moral equivalence between those defending against this terrorism and those perpetrating it. There can be no option other than zero tolerance for Hamas’ war crimes and genocidal agenda.”

Erdan also places blame on Iran for, in his words, funding and directing Hamas.

“The State of Israel will act in any way necessary to protect its citizens and sovereignty from the ongoing terrorist attacks originating from the Gaza Strip and carried out by Hamas and other terrorist organizations,” he writes. “We will not stand idly by as Israelis are attacked and killed.”

Defense Minister Yoav Gallant just got off the phone with his US counterpart Lloyd Austin during which the latter “reaffirmed that the \[Pentagon’s\] commitment to Israel’s security and its absolute right to defend itself from acts of terrorism is unwavering.”

“Secretary Austin has directed his team to ensure that DoD is closely consulting with all of our Allies and partners who share a commitment to peace and oppose terrorism,” the US readout says. “Secretary Austin will continue to consult with Minister Gallant in the coming days and weeks to ensure that Israel has the support it needs.”

The Israel Defense Forces claims to have killed hundreds of Palestinian terrorists in southern Israel and the Gaza Strip in the last few hours.

Among the counter-attacks is a drone strike against two terrorists attempting to breach the security barrier near the disused Karni crossing; nine terrorists killed during clashes with troops in the town of Nirim; and four terrorists targeted by a fighter jet at the Erez Crossing.

Other terror squads were killed by troops in the southern towns of Sufa, Kfar Aza, and Kerem Shalom, the IDF says.

The IDF also carried out several drone strikes against terrorists in the area.

The military publishes footage showing one of the strikes near the southern town of Be’eri.

Four terrorists are still holding two Israelis hostage in an apartment in Ofakim, some 12 miles (20 kilometers) from the Gaza border.

The incident has been playing out all day, since several carloads of terrorists drove into the city, Channel 12 reports.

When rocket alarms sounded, and residents of the city descended into bomb shelters, the gunmen opened fire on them, killing several people. Many terrorists have been killed in the hours since.

Four terrorists went up into an apartment in the city, where two Israelis remained, and they have been holding them hostage ever since.

Security forces have made several attempts to find a way to break in and rescue them, but to no avail thus far.

Magen David Adom’s Shai Kadosh says two people he knows were killed in the city during the day and that he and his colleagues have been treating casualties all day.

In light of the high number of injuries due to the war, the Health Ministry announces that all ambulatory and elective medical services will be canceled on Sunday at hospitals within 80 km of the Gaza border. Well-baby clinics will also be closed within that area.

Some hospitals in the center of the country, including Hadassah in Jerusalem and Meir in Kfar Saba, have also announced that they will only accept patients in need of urgent medical care.

Hospitals throughout the country will continue to provide critical and timely care, such as oncological and hematological treatments, dialysis, in vitro fertilization treatment, and emergency cardiological procedures.

If patients are scheduled for a hospital procedure or clinic visit on Monday, they should double-check with the hospital whether they should come in or not.

The Meuhedet health maintenance organization has asked its members to seek service from their primary physicians via hybrid (online) medicine appointments as much as possible.

All medical system employees have been ordered to cancel plans to travel outside the country, and all medical staff currently outside Israel have been asked to return.

The European Union “condemns in the strongest possible terms” the Hamas attacks on Israel, and stressed Israel’s right to self defense.

“The EU calls for an immediate cessation of these senseless attacks and violence,” says EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell in a statement issued on behalf of all 27 member states, “which will only further increase tensions on the ground and seriously undermine Palestinian people’s aspirations for peace.”

Borrell says the EU “stands in solidarity with Israel which has the right to defend itself in line with international law, in the face of such violent and indiscriminate attacks.”

A man says his wife, two young children and mother-in-law have been taken to Gaza and that he has seen them in a video from the coastal enclave.

Yoni Asher tells Channel 12 news that his wife and children aged three and five were visiting his mother-in-law at Kibbutz Nir Oz near the Gaza border when they were taken during an infiltration by Hamas terrorists.

Earlier this afternoon, he told the outlet that he had not spoken to his family for a number of hours but that he had tracked his wife’s phone to the Gaza Strip.

Asher issued desperate pleas for help in finding his family, speaking to multiple outlets in the hope that he could get the message out.

“I have seen my wife’s phone in \[Gaza city\] Khan Yunis,” he told the Kan public broadcaster. “I contacted the police, the Home Front Command and I don’t know what’s going on. I need your help so that I can contact my wife, my daughters and my mother-in-law.”

Israeli activists in the US launch a crowdfunding campaign to assist residents of southern Israel.

The activists from the anti-overhaul protest movement leverage their network of thousands of Israelis and US Jews in the US to respond to the Palestinian terror onslaught in Israel.

The funds will go to medical, psychological and physical support for the victims, [the campaign](https://www.americaisraeldemocracy.org/southunderattack)
 says.

“We join hands to support the needs of Israelis under attack. This is what we can do from here now,” organizers say. “This is exactly the same solidarity from which we stand in rallies every week.”

All protest activities are suspended.

With some flights to Israel canceled, the activists are also organizing local hosts who can house Israelis who are unable to return home.

Activists from the UnXeptable protest group urge Israelis who are in the US and need assistance to contact them.

An open support gathering will take place at the Jewish Community Center of Manhattan at 76th Street and Amsterdam Ave. between 2-4 p.m. this afternoon.

The Israeli consulate in New York also says it is accepting all offers of help and support.

The Secure Community Network, which coordinates security for Jewish communities in North America, urges vigilance but says there are no known threats to US Jews related to the terror onslaught in Israel.

The group says it is coordinating security measures with law enforcement and other partners.

“SCN recommends Jewish facilities review and enforce security protocols, and maintain coordination with law enforcement,” the group says in a statement.

Police in the New York town of Ramapo, which has a significant Jewish population, increase patrols to “ensure our residents’ safety during this crisis,” town supervisor Michael Specht says.

The Israel Defense Forces says it carried out airstrikes against two high-rise towers in the Gaza Strip that were used to house Hamas assets.

“The Hamas terrorist organization deliberately places its military assets in the heart of the civilian population in the Gaza Strip,” the IDF says.

“Prior to the strike, the IDF provided advance warning to the occupants of the building and asked them to evacuate,” the military adds.

Opposition Leader Yair Lapid calls for an “emergency government” to manage “the difficult and complex operation ahead of us” after more than 100 Israelis have been killed, close to 1,000 wounded and an unknown number of soldiers and civilians abducted by Hamas terrorists into Gaza.

“The State of Israel is at war. It won’t be easy and it won’t be short. It has strategic consequences which we haven’t seen for many years. There is a serious risk that it will become a multi-front war,” Lapid says in an announcement.

“A short while ago, I met with Prime Minister Netanyahu. I told him that in this emergency situation I’m willing to put aside our differences and form an emergency, narrow, professional government with him to manage the difficult and complex operation ahead of us.”

Netanyahu, he says, “knows that with the current extreme and dysfunctional security cabinet, he can’t manage a war. Israel needs to be led by a professional, experienced, and responsible government. I have no doubt that former Defense Minister \[Benny\] Gantz would also join a government like this.”

“Forming an emergency professional government will make clear to our enemies that the vast majority of Israeli citizens stand behind the IDF and security forces. It will make clear to the world, in the international community, that the people of Israel stand united against this threat,” says Lapid.

“The State of Israel suffered a hard blow today. We are all hurting, we are all angry. However, wars and countries aren’t managed with pain and anger but with calm and a strategic understanding of the situation. We need to put politics to one side for the sake of an emergency government that will manage this situation with determination and won’t deal with anything else until we achieve victory over our enemies.”

Lapid made his offer for an emergency government in person to Netanyahu after receiving a security update, says a source close to the opposition leader.

The source says that “the offer is real, this isn’t a political thing. The offer is there.”

Netanyahu has not responded and a source close to Lapid declines to comment if fellow opposition party head, National Unity leader Gantz, was consulted before or after the unity government offer was made.

During the call, which was requested by Secretary Austin, Gallant details recent events in Israel and operations carried out by the IDF and defense establishment, his office says.

Gallant says Israel is currently at war, and has been facing terror attacks against its citizens since this morning – this includes men, women, children and elderly individuals.

“The State of Israel will win this war, and Hamas will be held responsible for its actions,” his office says.

Gallant thanks Austin and the US Administration for their support for Israel.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has condemned Hamas’s surprise attack on southern and central Israel this morning.

“The secretary-general is appalled by reports that civilians have been attacked and abducted from their own homes,” says a statement from his spokesperson.

Guterres “is deeply concerned for the civilian population and urges maximum restraint. Civilians must be respected and protected in accordance with international humanitarian law at all times.”

“The secretary-general urges all diplomatic efforts to avoid a wider conflagration,” the statement continues. “He stresses that violence cannot provide a solution to the conflict, and that only through negotiation leading to a two-state solution can peace be achieved.”

The clips appear to show Israelis being abducted on foot and in vehicles, and were apparently filmed inside Israel and inside Gaza.

Many of the clips are too gruesome to broadcast.

By [Amanda Borschel-Dan](https://www.timesofisrael.com/writers/amanda-borschel-dan/ "Amanda Borschel-Dan")

Middle East analyst Avi Issacharoff tells The Times of Israel on Saturday that the unprecedented assault on Israel by land, sea and air is an inadvertent benchmark for the Israel-Hamas relations, as significant as the September 11, 2001 attacks on the US.

“I think that they wanted to kidnap a few people, to negotiate over them, and not to get into the threat of their collapse — of their ending” — that this coordinated attack will inevitably bring, Issacharoff says. “Everyone knows that Gaza will pay a very heavy price.”

Any former policies of cooperation with the Gaza-based terrorist organization are “not even relevant anymore,” he says, and negotiations “under or over the table” will no longer take place.

Asked whether he believes Israel’s northern border will become another front in the current war, he says it is as yet unclear whether Hezbollah is planning a coordinated attack.

“Either they’re going to jump in and be very stupid, or not,” he says.

“Starting another front with Israel may bring more \[Israeli\] casualties… but at the end of the day, we might end up with the end of Hamas and Hezbollah.”

“It’s the 9/11 \[for Israel\], and if this doesn’t go into a major ground operation, it’s the end of this government’s political life,” says Issacharoff.

The Israel Defense Forces’ top spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, confirms the Hamas terror group has taken Israelis as hostages to the Gaza Strip.

In a briefing with reporters, Hagari says Israeli soldiers have also been killed in the fighting.

No numbers are given on the number of hostages or soldiers killed.

Hagari says there are still 22 locations of ongoing fighting in southern Israel, including hostage situations in Be’eri and Ofakim.

He says Israeli troops have reached all towns on the Gaza border, and are working to scan each and every one.

Four divisions are being deployed to the Gaza border, joining 31 battalions that are already there, Hagari says.

Benny Gantz, the leader of the opposition National Unity party, pledges support for the security and emergency forces and says Israel is “completely unified.”

“I want to say clearly, in a way that resonates from Gaza, via Beirut, to Tehran: The entire people of Israel are united,” he says. “All Israel’s citizens stand behind the security forces, and the government has the backing to charge a heavy, painful and effective price in order that an event like this is not repeated.”

“There is no coalition and opposition now,” Gantz adds, “just a single fist that will pound the enemy.”

He says all those involved in this attack are destined to die, and that any other terror groups that decide to take part “will be making a terrible mistake.”

“It must be honestly said: the results of this attack are grave. Soon, some of the rumors will be confirmed as bad and painful news for us all. I send my condolences to the families of the fallen… and pray for the recovery of all the injured.”

He hails the bravery of civilians, the emergency services and soldiers. “Israel can be taken by surprise, but it cannot be beaten, as we will prove this time as well,” Gantz says.

“The soldiers opened fire toward the terrorists and thwarted dozens of them, as well as two rubber boats and two additional vessels,” the IDF adds.

The death toll from the Hamas terror group’s attack on Israel rises to more than 100, Hebrew-language media cite medical officials as saying.

The number is seen as certain to rise further.

Some 800 people have been wounded in the attacks, which have included hundreds of Hamas terrorists infiltrating into Israel and gunning down soldiers and civilians. Others were wounded in rocket attacks.

Ra’am’s Mansour Abbas urges Arab Israelis not to respond to rumors or incitement

Abbas, leader of the Islamist Ra’am party, is the first Arab Israeli political leader to publish a statement reacting to the ongoing deadly Hamas assault on Israel.

The party leader writes in Hebrew: “In light of the sad, tragic events since this morning, and the situation assessments saying that the situation may devolve into a regional war, I call on Arab citizens of Israel and on all citizens, Arabs and Jews alike, to exert restraint and behave responsibly and patiently, to obey the law and maintain public order.”

“I urge \[Arab Israeli citizens\] to restrain from any type of violence or damage to public or private property, and not respond to rumors or incitement aimed at causing an escalation inside or outside Arab towns, or in mixed cities.”

Abbas further calls for unity and mutual support and to give hospitality to families fleeing the areas under attack, particularly in the Negev and in unrecognized villages, many of which are not equipped with anti-rocket shelters.

Ella, a resident of Kibbutz Be’eri, tells Channel 12 that she is in a safe room at her home in the kibbutz and is hearing “lots of gunfire” nearby.

She speaks amid unconfirmed reports that Hamas gunmen are holding hostages at the kibbutz dining hall.

Meanwhile, another resident of the south says his wife and daughters have disappeared, and that he has traced his wife’s phone — which doesn’t answer — to Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip. He says he fears his family has been kidnapped to Gaza.

Hamas claims to have kidnapped dozens of Israeli civilians and soldiers to Gaza.

These reports are not officially confirmed by Israel. Channel 12 news reports, however, that Hamas has kidnapped men and women, young and old, civilians and soldiers to the Gaza Strip. The infiltration is proving “far more successful” from Hamas’s perspective than it would have expected, the TV station’s Ohad Hemo says, and Hamas almost certainly doesn’t know itself how many Israelis it has kidnapped.

In turn, though, Hemo says, the Israeli response in Gaza is likely to be much more far-reaching than Hamas would have expected.

A senior adviser to Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei expresses support for an attack Hamas launched against Israel, calling it a “proud operation.”

“We support the proud operation of Al-Aqsa Flood,” Yahya Rahim Safavi says at a meeting held in support of Palestinian children in Tehran, quoted by ISNA news agency.

“We support this operation, and we are sure that the resistance front also supports this issue,” says Safavi, who is a senior general in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.

Safavi expressed backing for the Palestinian terrorists “until the liberation of Palestine and Jerusalem.”

Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman Nasser Kanani also hailed the Palestinian terror assault on Israel.

“Today’s operation marked a new page in the field of resistance and armed operations against the occupiers,” he says.

“The resistance has so far achieved brilliant victories during this operation, and this is a bright spot in the history of the Palestinian people’s struggle against the Zionists.”

At a parliament session on Saturday, Iranian lawmakers chanted “Down with Israel,” “Down with America,” and “Welcome Palestine,” according to a video published by Tasnim news agency.

Iran, which hosted leaders of Hamas and Islamic Jihad in June, considers Israel its arch-enemy.

Over nine hours since the Hamas terror group launched a deadly assault on Israel with terrorists infiltrating from land, air and sea, there are still gunmen in a number of Israeli communities.

In addition, there is still near-continuous rocket fire — while the center of the country was targeted by projectiles earlier in the day, the fire is now mainly toward southern towns.

By [Gianluca Pacchiani](https://www.timesofisrael.com/writers/gianluca-pacchiani/ "Gianluca Pacchiani")

Saudi Arabia calls for an “immediate halt to the escalation between the two sides, the protection of civilians, and restraint” amid the ongoing assault by the Hamas terror group.

Riyadh says it ‘repeatedly warned’ of an explosive situation with Palestinians.

In a statement, the Kingdom recalls its “repeated warnings of the danger of the explosion of the situation, as a result of the continued occupation, the deprivation of the Palestinian people of their legitimate rights, and the repetition of systematic provocations against its sanctities.”

The Saudi Foreign Ministry further calls on the international community to lead a “credible peace process” to achieve a two-state solution.

The kingdom has been conducting negotiations to achieve a normalization deal with Israel. According to recent leaks, the Saudi negotiators, while insisting on concessions for the Palestinians, do not see the creation of a Palestinian state as a precondition for a possible deal.

President Isaac Herzog calls for the international community to unite in its condemnation of Hamas after the Gaza-based terror group launched a deadly attack.

“Today we saw the true face of Hamas. A terrorist army whose only goal is the cold-blooded murder of innocent men, women, and children. Supported and directed by their proxy commanders in Iran, they carried out an unprovoked, heinous attack against the Jewish state on a Jewish holy day. Innocent civilians were massacred and wounded, and many are still under attack,” Herzog says in a statement.

“The State of Israel will take all measures necessary to eliminate this clear and immediate danger to our citizens. Israel will overcome in the face of all challenges,” he says.

“I call upon the family of nations – this war waged against us marks a line in the sand. Now is the time to hear clear, unequivocal condemnation of Hamas, its allies, and its backers in Iran. Now is the time to stand firm with Israel in support of its just and moral battle in the face of an abhorrent enemy,” he says.

Shoval Kahlon, a resident of Sderot, describes the situation in the border town which was infiltrated by Hamas terrorists.

“There are Hamas troops walking around. We see videos of them. They’re walking round with impunity,” she tells the Kan public broadcaster from the bomb shelter of her home.

Security forces are fighting terrorists in at least four areas in the town, the broadcaster reports.

“We woke up at 6:30 a.m. to alarms, we thought it was the usual rocket attacks but we started hearing gunshots on the street, sounded like it came from the parking of our building. Then we realized something was unusual. We then started seeing Hamas people in pickup trucks. They knocked on the homes of residents, who thought they were Israeli soldiers. They took them hostage,” says Kahlon.

The United States “unequivocally condemns the unprovoked attacks by Hamas terrorists against Israeli civilians,” says White House National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson.

“There is never any justification for terrorism. We stand firmly with the government and people of Israel and extend our condolences for the Israeli lives lost in these attacks,” Watson says.

US “National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan has spoken to Israeli National Security Advisor Tzachi Hanegbi and we remain in close contact with our Israeli partners,” Watson adds.

A baby has been found at Kibbutz Kfar Aza near the Gaza border, and the parents are nowhere to be seen, Channel 12’s Tamir Steinman reports.

The baby is alive. Kibbutz residents are pleading for anyone who has information on the baby’s family to come forward.

The kibbutz is one of several places where Hamas gunmen are still believed to be on the loose.

Steinman, speaking a few minutes later, also says several of his friends and contacts who live in areas close to the Gaza border, including some he was talking to earlier today, “are no longer answering… and it’s clear why they’re not answering.”

The UN’s Middle East envoy Tor Wennesland “vehemently condemns” today’s multi-front Hamas assault of Israeli towns near Gaza and the firing of rockets into central Israel.

“These events have resulted in horrific scenes of violence and many Israeli fatalities and injuries, with many believed to be kidnapped inside the Strip. These are heinous attacks targeting civilians and must stop immediately,” Wennesland says in a statement.

“I am deeply concerned for the well-being of all civilians. I am in close contact with all concerned to urge maximum restraint and call on all sides to protect civilians.”

“This is a dangerous precipice and I appeal to all to pull back from the brink,” he adds.

The mayor of Sderot, Alon Davidi, says his city is still under attack.

“Don’t open the doors, stay inside, close the windows… we’re still searching the area,” he tells local residents via Channel 12.

He says the Hamas leadership, from Ismael Haniyeh on down, are “animals” who “must be harmed and killed.”

The people of Israel “haven’t yet seen” what’s happened in the city, he says — “inhuman acts” against innocent people. The terrorists have to be “wiped out,” he says.

Israel has given Gazans food, water and electricity, and allowed Gazans into work, he notes, but the Gaza Hamas leadership are “murderers who must be buried under the ground. Not because we are cruel, but because those who are merciful to the cruel, ultimately are cruel to the good.”

“People still don’t understand the numbers” and the extent of the attacks, he says.

A Channel 12 reporter in the city says there are many “bodies on the ground… terribly grave pictures, scenes that are hard to describe.”

These fatalities, the reporter stresses, are victims of gunfire by Hamas terrorists who infiltrated from Gaza into the city, not rocket attacks.

In addition, thousands of rockets have been fired at the center and south.

The assault has been ongoing since approximately 6:30 a.m.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu makes a statement at the start of the security cabinet meeting, calling for all the citizens of the country to unite.

“Since this morning, the State of Israel has been at war. Our first goal is first of all to cleanse the area of the enemy forces that have infiltrated, and restore security and peace to the settlements that were attacked,” Netanyahu says.

“The second goal, at the same time, is to exact a huge price from the enemy, also in the Gaza Strip,” he says.

“The third goal is to fortify other arenas so that no one makes the mistake of joining this war,” Netanyahu says.

“We are at war, in war, you have to keep calm. I call on all citizens of Israel to unite in order to achieve our highest goal – victory in the war,” the premier says.

The official name for the campaign by the Israel Defense Forces amid the devastating Hamas attack is Operation Swords of Iron.

Ukraine’s President writes a long post condemning the devastating Hamas terror assault on Israel and says that all its details should be revealed to the world.

Here is the post in full:

“Horrible news from Israel. My condolences go out to everyone who lost relatives or close ones in the terrorist attack. We have faith that order will be restored and terrorists will be defeated.

“Terror should have no place in the world, because it is always a crime, not just against a specific country or this terror’s victims, but against humanity in general and our entire world.

“Anyone who resorts to terror commits a crime against the world. Whoever finances terror is committing a crime against the world. The world must stand united and in solidarity so that terror does not attempt to break or subjugate life anywhere and at any moment.

“Israel’s right to self-defense is unquestionable.

“All details surrounding this terrorist assault must be revealed so that the world knows and holds accountable everyone who supported and helped carry out the attack.

“All Ukrainian citizens who remain in the risk zone must carefully obey all orders issued by local security services and remain vigilant. Please be cautious. The Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and our embassy in Israel are ready to assist in any situation.

“To support Ukrainians in Israel, we established an operational headquarters. If you require assistance, please contact any of our diplomatic or consular offices in any convenient and accessible manner.

Every life is valuable! We condemn all forms of terrorism.”

Channel 12 broadcasts footage from earlier this morning apparently showing a bulldozer breaking through the border fence between Israel and the Gaza Strip.

Dozens of terrorists from the Hamas terrorist group infiltrated into Israel by land, air and sea, going on deadly rampages through border communities.

The Hamas terror group has published footage showing its members capturing a number of Israeli soldiers during an attack on a military base on the border with the Gaza Strip this morning.

Other clips circulated online have purported to show Israeli civilians taken hostage by the terror group.

The IDF has yet to comment on the allegations.

EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell calls for the immediate release of Israeli hostages who were kidnapped and taken to Gaza amid a massive assault by the Hamas terror group.

“News of civilians taken as hostages in their homes or to Gaza are appalling,” Borrell writes on X, the social media site formerly known as Twitter.

“This is against international law,” he writes. “Hostages must be released immediately.”

The Hamas terror group has published footage showing its members capturing a number of Israeli soldiers during an attack on a military base on the border with the Gaza Strip this morning.

European leaders roundly condemn the massive assault by the Hamas terror group on Israel.

German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock says Hamas contributes to “the intensification of violence,” adding Israel “has our full solidarity” and “the right, guaranteed by international law, to defend itself against terrorism.”

France expresses “full solidarity with Israel and the victims” and underscored “its absolute rejection of terrorism and its commitment to Israel’s security.” French President Emmanuel Macron said he “firmly condemns” the attacks.

Italy also backed “Israel’s right to defend itself” against the “brutal attack.”

Britain’s foreign minister James Cleverly condemns the “horrific attacks” and underlined Israel’s right to self-defense.

Dutch PM Mark Rutte says: “Appalling images from Israel. Terror organization Hamas is waging an unprecedented attack on Israel… This violence must stop; Israel has every right to defend itself.”

Spain says it is “shocked by the indiscriminate violence” of the attacks on Israel while Ukraine and the Czech Republic say they back Israel’s right to defend itself.

The European Union “unequivocally” condemns attacks by the Palestinian group Hamas on Israel and called for an immediate stop to the violence.

The comments came after a barrage of rockets was fired and fighters from the Palestinian enclave infiltrated Israel, a major escalation in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

EU chief Ursula von der Leyen says she “unequivocally” condemns the “terrorist attack by Hamas on Israel,” adding that it was “terrorism in its most contemptible form.”

“Israel has the right to defend itself against such odious attack,” she adds.

“This horrific violence must stop immediately. Terrorism and violence solve nothing. The EU expresses its solidarity with Israel in these difficult moments,” EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell says.

European Council president Charles Michel also condemns the “indiscriminate attacks launched against Israel and its people this morning inflicting terror and violence against innocent citizens.”

“My thoughts are with all the victims. EU stands in solidarity with Israeli people in this horrific moment.”

Hezbollah praises the massive Hamas operation against Israel, and says it is message to Arab countries normalizing with Israel.

The terror group Hezbollah says it is in direct contact with the Hamas leadership in Gaza and abroad, and calls on Arab and Muslim peoples around the world to declare their support to Hamas and the Palestinian people, adding that armed resistance is the only way to confront the Israeli “aggression.”

Hezbollah adds that the “Al-Aqsa Deluge” operation launched by Hamas against Israel is a message to the international community and the Arab and Muslim world, in particular those countries seeking normalization with Israel.

It also calls on the Israeli government to learn the “important lessons” taught by the “Palestinian resistance.”

“Citizens of Israel, we are at war,” he says. “And we will win.”

“The enemy will pay a price like they have never known before,” he says, in his first public statement on the matter, some five hours since the start of the assault by the Gaza-based terror group.

Israeli residents near the Gaza Strip continue to ask for help and report on shooting by terrorists inside the towns while there is little or no IDF presence on the streets.

A pregnant Kibbutz Sufa resident speaks to Channel 12 from a safe room with her two-year-old child and close family members, saying: “They are shooting at our house, they are trying to break down the door of the safe room.”

She reports that her husband and four other armed residents are fighting in the streets with no aid from the military.

“I don’t understand how this is still going on. We’re in this situation since 6 a.m.,” she says. “Four people cannot fight them off alone

“Send help, please,” she cries.

Residents in other areas near the Gaza Strip report of unprecedented fighting on all major Israeli media sources. In an Instagram story timed to 9:55 a.m. cited by Ynet, a resident of Kfar Gaza writes: “I’m begging you!!! We can’t catch anyone! There are terrorists in Kfar Gaza, send forces to Kibbutz Kfar Gaza!!!”

A Channel 12 reporter in Beersheba describes receiving dozens of requests for help from residents of the Gaza Strip.

Mirjam Reijnen, a 42-year-old volunteer firefighter in Nahal Oz, tells AP: “With rockets we somehow feel safer, knowing that we have the Iron Dome (missile defense system) and our safe rooms. But knowing that terrorists are walking around communities is a different kind of fear,” she said, adding that she and her three kids have been too scared to leave the shelter even for a moment to use the bathroom.

Hamas says it has launched 5,000 rockets at Israel in an early morning surprise attack it calls “Operation Al-Aqsa Flood.”

Mohammad Deif, the Hamas military commander, issues a statement saying that the ongoing attacks are in retaliation for Israel’s “desecration” of the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem.

He adds that Israel killed and wounded hundreds of Palestinians this year, and that Israel rejected offers for prisoner exchange deals.

Over 5,000 missiles were fired, Deif claims.

“Today, the people are bringing back the revolution and reviving the March of Return,” he says.

He urges Arabs in Jerusalem and inside Israel, in the Negev, the Galilee and northern Israel “set the earth on fire under the feet of the occupiers.”

He further calls on the “Islamic resistance in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Lebanon” — countries with terror movements that are militarily supported by Iran — to “merge their resistance with that of the Palestinians today,” and “start marching towards Palestine now.”

Saleh al-Arouri, deputy head of Hamas who is considered to be its leader in the West Bank, issued a statement along the same lines, calling on the Arab and Islamic nations to join “Operation Al-Aqsa Flood.”

The video has been shared by Ryan Rozbiani @RyanRozbiani with the caption: “Hezbollah has claimed responsibility for the missile attack, stating the target was the headquarters of Israel’s Unit 8200 in Tel Aviv. Activating air defenses in Tel Aviv to try to confront a heavy missile barrage from Hezbollah. Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv has halted all air traffic due to the missile launches.”

In a statement, the Iran-backed group said it had fired missiles at the Nirit area in the Israeli capital. In a Telegram post, the Lebanese group said they carried out the recent attack in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza and in support of protecting the Lebanese people. Hezbollah’s statement came after a video verified by Al Jazeera’s Sanad agency.

According to a Reuters report, sirens sounded all around Tel Aviv during the airstrike. No casualties have been reported in the attack so far. Citing Israeli media reports, Al Jazeera reported that all air traffic at Ben Gurion airport was suspended after Hezbollah carried out airstrikes and the Israeli military declared a state of emergency in the Tel Aviv region.

The Israeli military confirmed that Hezbollah fired at least 20 rockets toward Tel Aviv.

Hezbollah and Israel have been engaged in a fierce military conflict since the Palestinian militant group Hamas launched a massive attack on Israel on October 7, 2023.

TEL AVIV, July 19 (Reuters) - A long-range Iranian-made drone hit the centre of Tel Aviv in the early hours of Friday in an attack claimed by the Yemen-based [Houthi](/world/middle-east/who-are-yemens-houthis-why-are-they-under-attack-2024-01-12/)
 militia that killed one man and wounded four others, the Israeli military and emergency services said.

The explosion, which footage shared on social media suggested came from the sea and did not trigger air raid alarms, occurred hours after the Israeli military [confirmed](/world/middle-east/commander-hezbollahs-radwan-forces-killed-israeli-strike-south-lebanon-two-2024-07-18/)
 it had killed a senior commander of the Iran-backed Hezbollah militia in southern Lebanon.

Chief spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said the military assessed that the drone, which hit a building near the beachfront close to U.S. Embassy premises in Tel Aviv, was an upgraded Iranian-made Samad-3 model.

"Our estimation is that it arrived from Yemen to Tel Aviv," he told a press briefing.

A spokesman for the Houthis, which like Hezbollah are aligned with Iran, said the group had attacked Tel Aviv with a drone and would continue to target Israel in solidarity with Palestinians in the Gaza war.

The attack, which took place ahead of a visit to Washington by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu next week, is likely to fan fears about further fallout from the Gaza war as the Houthis and other Iranian proxies side with the Palestinian militant group Hamas.

Defence Minister Yoav Gallant met military commanders to review air defences and said the country had to be ready for all scenarios. "We must be prepared for defensive and offensive actions," he said, according to a statement from his office.

An Israeli official said the military was still investigating why the drone did not trigger the alarm, but initial reports suggested the aircraft was identified but the sirens were not sounded due to human error.

"We're talking about a large UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) that can fly large distances," the military official told journalists after the strike.

**\[1/12\]**A man looks at a building damaged at the site of an explosion, amid the Israel-Hamas conflict in Tel Aviv, Israel July 19, 2024. The mayor of Tel Aviv said the city, Israel's economic centre, had been moved to a state of heightened alert.

In the hours following Friday's attack, sirens sounded repeatedly in areas close to the border with Lebanon and Israeli air defences intercepted at least one aerial target that crossed into Israel.

"OPERATION ACHIEVED ITS GOALS"
------------------------------

Houthi spokesperson Yahya Saree called Tel Aviv a primary target "within the range of our weapons".

He said the strike was carried out using a new drone called "Yafa", which he said was capable of bypassing interception systems and undetectable by radars.

"The operation has achieved its goals successfully," Saree said in a televised speech.

Israel's emergency services said the body of a 50 year-old man was found in an apartment close to the explosion and four people were taken to hospital with slight shrapnel injuries.

The military said air patrols had been increased to protect Israeli airspace but said it had not ordered new civil defence measures. All of them were later released, health services said.

Israel has been exchanging daily missile and artillery fire with Hezbollah along its northern border and in southern Lebanon since the start of the war in Gaza, prompting fears of a wider regional conflict if the situation escalates.

The Houthis have also stepped up attacks against Israel and Western targets, saying they are acting in solidarity with the Palestinians, after Israel invaded the Gaza Strip following last year's attack by Hamas militants on southern Israel.

Hamas-led fighters stormed Israeli towns on Oct. Since then, nearly 39,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's assault on the Gaza Strip, according to health authorities in the enclave.

[SKIP ADVERTISEMENT](#after-bottom) It was at least the sixth such attack over the past month.

The attack set off air-raid sirens across central Israel ordering hundreds of thousands of residents to enter reinforced bomb shelters. The missile landed in a playground in Tel Aviv in the middle of the night.

Yahya Saree, a military spokesman for the Houthis, said the group’s fighters had launched the missile “to aid the victory of the oppressed Palestinian people and its fighters.” He also claimed it had struck a “military target.”

On Thursday, Israeli fighter jets flew over 1,000 miles to bombard sites in Houthi-controlled Yemen, including the capital, Sana. The Israeli military said it had struck power plants as well as fuel and oil tanks.

Israel and the Houthis, who control much of northwestern Yemen, have traded fire since October 2023, when the Yemeni militia began firing rockets and drones at Israel in what it has described as a campaign in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:58> This image shows the aftermath of a Houthi attack on Tel Aviv, Israel, in July 2024."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:58>)
web_search("Houthi attack Tel Aviv July 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (<image:58>) appears in articles reporting an explosion in Tel Aviv. One article, from LBC Group, mentions bomb disposal experts on the scene and was published on July 19, 2024, ([https://www.lbcgroup.tv/news/middleeastnews/784660/explosion-in-tel-aviv-building-bomb-disposal-experts-on-site-israeli-p/en](https://www.lbcgroup.tv/news/middleeastnews/784660/explosion-in-tel-aviv-building-bomb-disposal-experts-on-site-israeli-p/en)). Another article from India.com, published on October 22, 2024, reports that Hezbollah fired rockets at Tel Aviv ([https://www.india.com/news/israel-hezbollah-war-hezbollah-fires-20-rockets-at-israels-capital-tel-aviv-horrific-videos-go-viral-watch-7342129/](https://www.india.com/news/israel-hezbollah-war-hezbollah-fires-20-rockets-at-israels-capital-tel-aviv-horrific-videos-go-viral-watch-7342129/)). The Times of Israel also features the image in a live blog about the ongoing attacks on Israel ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-october-7-2023/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-october-7-2023/)).


### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources discuss a Houthi drone attack on Tel Aviv, Israel, on July 19, 2024, which resulted in one death and several injuries. The attack targeted an apartment building and was claimed by the Houthi movement. The drone was not intercepted due to human error. (<image:58>)

Another source mentions a long-range Iranian-made drone hit Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024, in an attack claimed by the Yemen-based Houthi militia. (<image:131>) The New York Times reports that Houthi militants launched a missile that landed in Tel Aviv in December 2024.

## Elaboration
The claim is supported by the evidence. The image depicts the aftermath of an explosion in Tel Aviv. The web search confirms a Houthi drone attack on Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024, which caused damage and was claimed by the Houthi movement.


## Final Judgement
The image shows the aftermath of an explosion in Tel Aviv. The web search confirms a Houthi drone attack on Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024, which caused damage and was claimed by the Houthi movement.

The claim is factually accurate as it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources. `true`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image depicts the aftermath of an explosion in Tel Aviv, which aligns with reports of a Houthi drone attack on July 19, 2024, as confirmed by sources like Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-military-says-tel-aviv-blast-apparently-caused-by-drone-2024-07-19/](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-military-says-tel-aviv-blast-apparently-caused-by-drone-2024-07-19/)) and Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024\_Houthi\_drone\_attack\_on\_Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Houthi_drone_attack_on_Israel)).

Hunched amidst the rubble in Kahramanmaras, Mesut Hancer is pictured holding the hand of his daughter 15-year-old Irmak – her pale fingers visible through the slabs of concrete and broken bricks that once formed the apartment block where the family lived.

Irmak is still lying on her bed, with what appears to be a pink bedsheet pulled from it to expose the mattress. Around her lies debris – from a sofa cushion to the heavy brick walls, smashed into tiny pieces.

Her father gazes into the distance with a vacant expression, as he sits sat on the rubble of what was once their home.

The earthquake occurred around 4km southeast of Ekinözü in the Kahramanmaraş province, where Mr Hancer and his daughter are pictured. Some of the heaviest devastation occurred between Kahramanmaras and Gaziantep, a city of two million people where entire streets now lie in ruins as snow falls.

Turkish authorities report that 13.5 million people were affected across an area spanning roughly 450km from Adana in the west to Diyarbakir in the east, and 300km from Malatya in the north to Hatay in the south.

Another heartbreaking story of loss, the newborn was the only member of her family to survive. She is believed to have been born three hours earlier, according to how far her temperature had plummeted.

Footage of the rescue shows a search team member lifting the dust-covered infant to safety in the small town of Jinderis. Located in the rebel-held enclave of northwest Syria close to the Turkish border, it was hard hit by the quake with multiple buildings destroyed.

The story behind this Turkey earthquake photo that 'many will never forget'
===========================================================================

Turkish father Mesut Hancer wanted the world to see his — and his nation's — grief. And it did.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![A man sitting holding the hand of someone who is beneath rubble.](https://images.sbs.com.au/dims4/default/f96276f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3039x1710+463+624/resize/1280x720!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsbs-au-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F6e%2Ff1%2Ff608b67744b0b21f069d8e6188b7%2Fgettyimages-1246861398.jpg&imwidth=1280)

###### KEY POINTS

*   Mesut Hancer was photographed as he held the hand of his daughter who was buried beneath debris.
*   It was a delicate moment. But instead of shooing a photographer away, the father called him in.
*   The photo appeared on the front pages of major newspapers across the world

It was a moment encapsulating the unspeakable pain of the Turkish earthquake: a father holding his 15-year-old's hand, the only thing visible after her body was crushed by concrete.  
  

Mesut Hancer sat alone in the freezing cold on a pile of broken bricks that were once his home, oblivious to the world and overwhelmed by grief.  
  

His daughter, Irmak, was dead. But he refused to let her go, caressing the fingers peeking out from a mattress the girl was asleep on when [the first pre-dawn tremor struck on Monday](/news/article/australia-pledges-10-million-in-aid-to-syria-and-turkey-as-devastating-earthquake-kills-thousands/s7c0xn5y5)
.  
  

There were no rescue teams. Survivors were frantically clawing their way through the rubble to find loved ones, bits of their homes thrown out onto the debris-strewn street.  

!A man sitting down and holding the hand of someone who is beneath rubble.  <image:2601>

Bedframes lay on top of shattered balconies. Torn clothes and toys told the tale of lives lost.  
  

It was too late for Irmak, one of nearly 20,000 people confirmed to have died in [the most powerful earthquake to strike Turkey and Syria in nearly a century](/news/article/the-three-reasons-why-the-turkey-syria-earthquake-was-so-devastating/qgetwuxvv)
.  
  

But Adem Altan, a veteran photographer with news agency AFP who rushed to the scene from Ankara, could not take his eyes off the still, silently mourning father.  
  

He trained his camera on Mr Hancer from 60 metres away. It was a delicate moment. But instead of shooing Mr Altan away, the father called him in.  
  

"Take pictures of my child," Mr Hancer called in a low, trembling voice.

### 'I was speechless'

The father wanted the world to see his — and his nation's — grief. And it did.  
  

The AFP photograph appeared on the front pages of major newspapers across the world, including the Financial Times and the Wall Street Journal.  
  

"As I took photos, I was so sad. I kept repeating to myself, 'what immense pain'. I couldn't stop myself from crying," Mr Altan recalled.  
  

"I was speechless."  
  

Mr Altan asked Hancer his name and then his daughter's name.

"He was speaking with difficulty, so I could not talk to him too much," Mr Altan said.  
  

Mr Altan could not ask too many questions because everyone needed to observe silence to hear whether there were survivors underneath the rubble.  
  

A photographer for 40 years, including 15 with AFP, Mr Altan knew that the photograph represented Turkey's pain.  
  

But its global impact surprised him. It has been shared hundreds of thousands of times online.  
  

Mr Altan has received thousands of messages from people worldwide, wanting to offer support.  
  

"Many told me they will never forget this image," he said.  

### Hope for more survivors fades

Cold, hunger and despair gripped hundreds of thousands of people left homeless after the earthquakes that struck Turkey and Syria three days ago as the death toll passed 20,000 on Thursday.  
  

The rescue of a 2-year-old boy after 79 hours trapped in the rubble of a collapsed building in Hatay, Turkey, and several other people raised spirits among weary search crews. But hopes were fading that many more would be found alive in the ruins of towns and cities.  
  

The death toll across both countries has now surpassed the more than 17,000 killed in 1999 when a similarly powerful quake hit northwest Turkey.

A Turkish official said the disaster posed "very serious difficulties" for the holding of an election scheduled for 14 May in which President Tayyip Erdogan has been expected to face his toughest challenge in two decades in power.  
  

With anger simmering over delays in the delivery of aid and getting the rescue effort underway, the disaster is likely to play into the vote if it goes ahead.  
  

The first United Nations convoy carrying aid to stricken Syrians crossed over the border from Turkey.

In Syria's Idlib province, Munira Mohammad, a mother of four who fled Aleppo after the quake, said: "It is all children here, and we need heating and supplies, last night we couldn't sleep because it was so cold. It is very bad."  
  

Hundreds of thousands of people in both countries have been left homeless in the middle of winter. Many have camped out in makeshift shelters in supermarket car parks, mosques, roadsides or amid the ruins, often desperate for food, water and heat.  
  

Some 40 per cent of buildings in the Turkish city of Kahramanmaras, epicentre of the tremor, are damaged, according to a preliminary report by Turkey's Bogazici University.

Mesut Hancer holds the hand of his 15-year-old daughter Irmak, who died in the earthquake in Kahramanmaras, Turkey, close to the epicenter, on February 7.

CNN  — 

It’s been a week since a massive [7.8 magnitude earthquake](https://cnn.com/2023/02/07/middleeast/earthquake-turkey-syria-why-deadly-intl/index.html)
 rocked [Turkey](https://cnn.com/2023/02/11/middleeast/turkey-syria-earthquake-recovery-intl/index.html)
 and [Syria](https://cnn.com/2023/02/08/middleeast/syria-left-behind-earthquake-mime-intl/index.html)
, claiming the lives of more than [36,000](https://cnn.com/middleeast/live-news/turkey-syria-earthquake-updates-2-13-23-intl/index.html)
 people. Many tens of thousands more have been injured. Millions may be left homeless.

Few images have captured the devastation of the past week as starkly as a photograph of Mesut Hancer.

He was photographed holding the hand of his 15-year-old daughter, Irmak, under the rubble in the southern Turkish city of Kahramanmaras, near the epicenter of the quake. He said she died at the moment it hit, with no chance of escape.

In an interview with CNN Turk Saturday, Hancer spoke about the lives behind the image that has come to define last week’s tragic disaster.

Irmak had been visiting her grandmother, Hancer said, and he spent three days trying to free her body from the rubble.

“It was awful. As soon as I heard the news, I rushed there. And with my own bare hands, with my own means, with great effort I tried to pull out my daughter. However, unfortunately, I couldn’t save my daughter,” Hancer said.

“Losing a mother, a father or siblings aside, losing a child is on another level of despair,” he said.

When Hancer arrived at the wreckage, the terrible reality of the situation became apparent.

![Seven members of his family ended up under the rubble, Hancer told CNN Turk.](https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230207121217-06-earthquake-020723-kahramanmaras-turkey.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill)

Seven members of his family ended up under the rubble, Hancer told CNN Turk.

“I didn’t have hope because there was a large girder on my daughter. Her waist up was free but below her waist under the rubble,” she was crushed, he said. “Unfortunately, during the earthquake, she died right there and then. She didn’t have a chance of survival.”

Hancer said he spent three days trying to free his daughter’s body from the rubble.

“With my own effort, with my own means, I reached her. I couldn’t ask anyone \[for help\], because there are a lot of people under the rubble,” he said.

The death toll in Turkey has reached 31,643, Turkish Emergency Coordination Center SAKOM said Monday. The confirmed death toll in Syria is 4,574.

[Rescue efforts](https://cnn.com/2023/02/10/middleeast/turkey-syria-earthquake-intl/index.html)
 continue in both countries, but authorities have been overwhelmed by the sheer scale of the disaster. More than [5,700 buildings](https://cnn.com/2023/02/08/middleeast/turkey-earthquake-public-anger-intl/index.html)
 in Turkey have collapsed, according to the country’s disaster agency.

“I also talked with AFAD \[the Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency in Turkey\], and they helped as much as they could. But they said they could not provide an excavator to that area,” Hancer said.

Hancer is grieving not only for his daughter. The earthquake struck when members of his family had traveled across Turkey to his mother’s house, where his daughter was staying.

“My mother, my two older brothers, my sister-in-law and her little daughter. There were seven people including my daughter. They were all under the rubble,” Hancer said.

Hancer’s home has also been badly damaged, he said, adding that he doesn’t have anywhere to stay. “We cannot enter our house because we don’t have the means. We are left outside.”

Thousands of families are facing similar grief and devastation.

Meanwhile, amid growing public anger over the government’s response to the disaster, Turkish authorities have carried out a wave of arrests of property developers accused of “negligence” over building collapses due to last week’s earthquake.

1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

In the background of the page, a satellite image of Nuseirat shows the location of a building with 1 hostage, and a nearby building with 3 hostages.

On June 8, Israel conducted one of the most high-risk operations of the war — a rescue in broad daylight of four hostages held by Hamas in Nuseirat, a densely populated area.

Israel achieved that goal, but within minutes, the operation escalated into a firefight and a series of airstrikes that killed scores of people. The New York Times was not able to verify which came first.

The background satellite image of Nuseirat highlights multiple buildings that were damaged or destroyed near the two locations where hostages were held.

The Times analysis — using satellite images, witness accounts and more than 60 videos — revealed that the strikes destroyed or damaged at least 42 buildings. The areas hit included apartment buildings and a crowded market, helping to explain the high death toll.

Palestinian health officials said 274 people were killed, including 64 children. In press statements, Israeli officials said that Hamas was holding the hostages in civilian apartment buildings and firing from civilian areas, making it “impossible” to rescue the captives without harming bystanders.

Pointing to the death toll — and that Hamas held hostages in an area populated by civilians — Jeremy Laurence, a United Nations human rights office spokesperson, said in a [statement](https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-briefing-notes/2024/06/shock-impact-civilians-israeli-raid-gaza-free-hostages)
 that “all these actions, by both parties, may amount to war crimes.”

Firefight Amid Hostage Rescue
-----------------------------

Around 11 a.m., Israeli special forces entered two low-rise apartment buildings about 250 yards apart. They rescued Noa Argamani, 26, from [one of them](https://x.com/NemoAnno/status/1802647117732671849)
 and drove her three miles to a waiting helicopter on the Gazan coast.

On the satellite map, a video of the building where three hostages were being held is added at the geolocated site of the building.

At 11:15 a.m., video released by the Israeli police shows that a heavy gunfight broke out near the building where three men — Almog Meir Jan, 22, Andrey Kozlov, 27, and Shlomi Ziv, 41 — were being held by a man who had worked for the [Hamas-affiliated news ag](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/10/world/middleeast/israel-hostage-rescue-gaza.html)
