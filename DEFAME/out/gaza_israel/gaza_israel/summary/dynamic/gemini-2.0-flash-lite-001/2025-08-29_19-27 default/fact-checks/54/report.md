### Evidence from `web_search`
The U.S. government has arranged chartered flights for American citizens in Israel to Europe, starting in October 2023, according to ABC News ([https://abcnews.go.com/US/state-department-announces-plan-fly-americans-israel/story?id=103934725](https://abcnews.go.com/US/state-department-announces-plan-fly-americans-israel/story?id=103934725)). CBS News reports that the U.S. government assisted in the evacuation of U.S. citizens from Israel, with charter flights landing in Tampa, Florida ([https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mike-huckabee-us-evacuation-americans-in-israel/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mike-huckabee-us-evacuation-americans-in-israel/)). Newsweek also reports that the State Department has begun assisted departure flights from Israel for U.S. citizens and lawful residents ([https://www.newsweek.com/state-dept-starts-exit-flights-israel-trump-mulls-war-entry-2088832](https://www.newsweek.com/state-dept-starts-exit-flights-israel-trump-mulls-war-entry-2088832)). ![image 6380](media/2025-08-29_19-49-1756496992-887958.jpg), ![image 6395](media/2025-08-29_19-50-1756497016-560545.jpg), ![image 6392](media/2025-08-29_19-50-1756497012-811115.jpg)


## Elaboration
The claim is partially supported by the evidence. The U.S. government is offering loans to Americans for flights out of Lebanon in October 2024, and has arranged chartered flights for Americans out of Israel. However, the evidence does not specify that the U.S. government has been flying Israeli citizens out of Israel on chartered flights. The evidence only mentions that the U.S. government has been assisting *American* citizens in leaving Israel. Therefore, the claim is only partially accurate.


## Final Judgement
The U.S. government is providing assistance to Americans in Lebanon, including loans for flights, and has arranged chartered flights for Americans leaving Israel. However, the claim that the U.S. government has been flying Israeli citizens out of Israel on chartered flights is not supported by the evidence.

`false`
