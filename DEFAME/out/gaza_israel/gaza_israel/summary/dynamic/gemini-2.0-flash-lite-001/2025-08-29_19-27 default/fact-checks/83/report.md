### Evidence from `web_search`
FC Barcelona's president, Joan Laporte, invited representatives from the Israeli Embassy in Spain to a soccer match and was presented with an Israeli flag as a sign of support for Israel, according to an i24NEWS article from February 16, 2023 ([https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/israel/diplomacy/1676623454-barcelona-soccer-team-sends-message-of-support-for-israel](https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/israel/diplomacy/1676623454-barcelona-soccer-team-sends-message-of-support-for-israel)). The Times of Israel also reported on this event ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/spanish-fm-swipes-at-barcelona-for-cutting-ties-with-israel/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/spanish-fm-swipes-at-barcelona-for-cutting-ties-with-israel/)).

The image in the claim (![image 52](media/83.jpg)) appears to be the same as the one in the i24NEWS article (![image 6691](media/2025-08-29_20-03-1756497831-342851.jpg)).


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the image shows FC Barcelona's president, Joan Laporta, with representatives from the Israeli Embassy. This event occurred on February 16, 2023, not in September 2024. The evidence also does not confirm whether the Gaza war was ongoing at the time of the meeting.

Therefore, the claim is inaccurate regarding the date and the context of the Gaza war.


## Final Judgement
The image shows FC Barcelona's president with Israeli Embassy representatives, but the event occurred in February 2023, not September 2024. The claim also incorrectly states that the meeting occurred during the ongoing Gaza war.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image depicts FC Barcelona's president, Joan Laporta, with Israeli Embassy representatives, but the event occurred in February 2023, as reported by the [Jerusalem Post](https://www.jpost.com/international/article-731893) and [i24NEWS](https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/israel/diplomacy/1676623454-barcelona-soccer-team-sends-message-of-support-for-israel), not in September 2024. The claim also incorrectly states that the meeting occurred during the ongoing Gaza war.
