Useful result: From [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/27/israel-says-10-killed-in-rocket-attack-on-occupied-golan-heights): 
Content: The Al Jazeera article, published on July 27, 2024, reports that at least 12 people were killed and 30 wounded in a rocket attack on a football pitch in Majdal Shams in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. <image:i>. Israel accused Hezbollah of carrying out the attack, but Hezbollah denied responsibility. The article includes images of the aftermath of the attack.

The claim '<image:25> This image shows the youngest victim of the Hezbollah rocket that murdered 12 children playing soccer in Israel on July 27, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While a rocket attack on a soccer field in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights on July 27, 2024, resulted in the deaths of 12 children, the image provided is unrelated to the event. The search results confirm the attack ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Israel%E2%80%93Hezbollah_conflict_(27_July_2024_%E2%80%93_16_September_2024)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Israel%E2%80%93Hezbollah_conflict_(27_July_2024_%E2%80%93_16_September_2024))) and ([https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/nine-people-killed-rocket-hits-football-pitch-israeli-occupied-golan-israel-2024-07-27/](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/nine-people-killed-rocket-hits-football-pitch-israeli-occupied-golan-israel-2024-07-27/)) ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/27/israel-says-10-killed-in-rocket-attack-on-occupied-golan-heights](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/27/israel-says-10-killed-in-rocket-attack-on-occupied-golan-heights)).
