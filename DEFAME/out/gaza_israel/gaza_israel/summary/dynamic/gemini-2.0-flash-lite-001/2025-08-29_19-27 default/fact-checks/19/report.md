## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Guardian published a live blog on July 7 and 8, 2025, covering Donald Trump's meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House, amid indirect talks between Israel and Hamas. The article also mentions Trump calling Musk's new political party 'ridiculous'. ([https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/jul/07/donald-trump-elon-musk-new-party-us-politics-live-latest-news](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/jul/07/donald-trump-elon-musk-new-party-us-politics-live-latest-news))

France 24 reported on February 5, 2025, that an AI-generated photo of Elon Musk, Donald Trump, and Benjamin Netanyahu is circulating on social media, debunking the claim that the image is authentic (![image 16](media/19.jpg)). NDTV published an article on January 20, 2025, discussing Elon Musk's praise for Donald Trump's negotiation skills (![image 16](media/19.jpg)).


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the image is not authentic. France 24 reported that the image of Donald Trump, Benjamin Netanyahu, and Elon Musk is AI-generated.


## Final Judgement
The claim that the image is authentic is false. Multiple sources confirm that the image is AI-generated.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE
