The U.S. Marine Corps website discusses the 40th anniversary of the Beirut barracks bombing, which occurred on October 23, 1983, and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) responded to the Marine barracks bombing in Beirut, Lebanon in 1983. The article mentions the 1981 siege of Beirut by Israel. (![image 10](media/10.jpg)
