### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results include a Wikipedia article about the timeline of the Israelâ€“Hezbollah conflict from July 27, 2024, to September 16, 2024, which mentions a Hezbollah rocket striking a soccer field in Majdal Shams on July 27, 2024, killing 12 children. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Israel%E2%80%93Hezbollah_conflict_(27_July_2024_%E2%80%93_16_September_2024)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Israel%E2%80%93Hezbollah_conflict_(27_July_2024_%E2%80%93_16_September_2024)))

Reuters and Al Jazeera also report on the rocket attack on a football ground in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights on July 27, 2024, which killed 12 people, including children. ([https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/nine-people-killed-rocket-hits-football-pitch-israeli-occupied-golan-israel-2024-07-27/](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/nine-people-killed-rocket-hits-football-pitch-israeli-occupied-golan-israel-2024-07-27/)) ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/27/israel-says-10-killed-in-rocket-attack-on-occupied-golan-heights](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/27/israel-says-10-killed-in-rocket-attack-on-occupied-golan-heights)). Hezbollah denied responsibility for the attack. ![image 5126](media/2025-08-23_01-31-1755912715-728512.jpg)

## Elaboration

## Final Judgement
The search results confirm that a rocket attack on a soccer field in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights on July 27, 2024, resulted in the deaths of 12 children. However, the image provided does not appear to be related to the event.

The claim is demonstrably false because the image is not related to the event described. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification

While a rocket attack on a soccer field in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights on July 27, 2024, resulted in the deaths of 12 children, the image provided is unrelated to the event.
