The image is available on [Getty Images](https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/israeli-men-carry-a-coffin-draped-in-israeli-flag-during-a-news-photo/1250797534) and [Getty Images](https://www.gettyimages.ie/detail/news-photo/israeli-men-carry-a-coffin-draped-in-israeli-flag-during-a-news-photo/1244484629).

### Evidence from `web_search`
The BBC News article from February 20, 2025, discusses the return of Israeli hostages' bodies, including Oded Lifschitz, Shiri Bibas, and her two sons, Ariel and Kfir (![image 6675](media/2025-08-29_20-02-1756497779-398096.jpg), ![image 6676](media/2025-08-29_20-02-1756497779-611678.jpg), ![image 6678](media/2025-08-29_20-03-1756497780-332184.jpg)). The Times of Israel published an article on September 5, 2024, about a protest in Tel Aviv where protesters carried 27 mock coffins to represent hostages killed in Gaza, which includes the image in the claim (![image 49](media/80.jpg)). The JTA article from August 29, 2025, discusses the relocation of an Israeli hostage awareness event in Boulder, Colorado, due to harassment.



## Elaboration
The claim is inaccurate. The image depicts a protest in Tel Aviv on September 5, 2024, where protesters carried mock coffins to represent hostages killed in Gaza, not dead Israeli soldiers. The image was taken by GALI TIBBON and is available on Getty Images.


## Final Judgement
The image shows mock coffins used in a protest in Tel Aviv on September 5, 2024, representing hostages killed in Gaza, not dead Israeli soldiers. The image is from a protest and not from a reburial ceremony.

`false`
