Content: The Suburban published an article stating that Mayor Valérie Plante was served by bailiff regarding electronic signs used by pro-Palestinian activists. The signs displayed anti-Israel messages. The article mentions that the signs were used to call for violence and convey radical political messages. <image:5924> The article is authored by Joel Goldenberg.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.readthemaple.com/city-of-montreal-illegally-seized-pro-palestine-signs-activists-allege/): 
Content: The article from The Maple, published on September 5, 2024, discusses the City of Montreal's removal of pro-Palestine signs ahead of a federal by-election. The signs were put up by LaSalle-Émard-Verdun pour la Palestine (LEV4P), a registered third-party campaign group. The City admitted to removing some signs and returned 95 out of 450. The article mentions a previous case where the City was ordered to pay damages for removing pro-Palestine signs. The article also mentions a tweet from Jeremy Levi, the mayor of Hampstead, who called the election signs "hate propaganda." The article does not mention the traffic sign in the claim.

Useful result: From [Source](https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-mayor-warned-to-act-on-anti-israel-messages-on-road-signs): 
Content: The Montreal Gazette published an article on July 26, 2024, reporting that electronic roadwork billboards in Montreal displayed anti-Israel messages, including "Free Palestine" and "Escalate Now." The article states that the city said the signs were vandalized and that the messages were unauthorized. The mayor of Hampstead threatened legal action against Montreal's mayor, Valérie Plante, over the messages. <image:13>

The claim '<image:13> This image shows a traffic sign in Montreal in July 2024 which displays a 'Free Palestine. Escalate now' message and was authorized by Montreal's Mayor Valérie Plante.' is false.
Justification: The image depicts a traffic sign in Montreal displaying "Free Palestine. Escalate now." While the evidence confirms the existence of such signs in Montreal and mentions Mayor Valérie Plante's involvement, it does not explicitly state that she authorized the specific sign in the image, leading to a "false" verdict.

So, the overall veracity is: false
