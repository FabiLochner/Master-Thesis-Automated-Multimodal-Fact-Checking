Useful result: From [Source](https://www.gettyimages.com/photos/children-gaza): 
Content: The Getty Images search result contains multiple images of Palestinian children in Gaza, some amidst rubble. The images are dated from October 2023 to June 2025 and show the impact of Israeli airstrikes. <image:6791>, <image:6796>, <image:6797>, <image:6798>, <image:6800>, <image:6802>, <image:6803>, <image:6804>, <image:6806>, <image:6808>, <image:6810>.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/czryry57x4do): 
Content: The BBC article from July 24, 2025, discusses a photograph of a starving child in Gaza. The article mentions that the photographer wanted to "show the rest of the world extreme hunger" that babies and children are experiencing in the Gaza Strip. <image:6824>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo/palestinian-child-in-rubble.html): 
Content: The Alamy website contains stock photos and images of Palestinian children in rubble.

The claim '<image:59> This image shows a palestinian child stuck under the rubble in Gaza after an Israeli airstrike in July 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim that the image shows a Palestinian child stuck under rubble in Gaza after an Israeli airstrike in July 2024 cannot be verified. While the image search and web search results provide context about children in Gaza and Israeli airstrikes, they do not confirm the image's origin, date, or the cause of the rubble. The evidence includes images of children in rubble in Gaza ([https://www.gettyimages.com/photos/children-gaza](https://www.gettyimages.com/photos/children-gaza)), but none of the provided sources contain the image in the claim.

So, the overall veracity is: false
