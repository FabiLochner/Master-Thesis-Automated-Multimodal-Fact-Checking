The New York Post ([https://nypost.com/2022/08/01/biden-to-speak-after-us-takes-out-al-qaeda-target-in-afghanistan/](https://nypost.com/2022/08/01/biden-to-speak-after-us-takes-out-al-qaeda-target-in-afghanistan/)), ISWNews ([https://english.iswnews.com/24517/ayman-al-zawahiri-the-leader-of-al-qaeda-was-killed-what-will-be-the-possible-consequences-of-this-assassination/](https://english.iswnews.com/24517/ayman-al-zawahiri-the-leader-of-al-qaeda-was-killed-what-will-be-the-possible-consequences-of-this-assassination/)), and News18.com ([https://www.news18.com/news/world/al-zawahiri-liked-sitting-outside-on-his-balcony-the-cia-watched-for-months-before-killing-him-5671915.html](https://www.news18.com/news/world/al-zawahiri-liked-sitting-outside-on-his-balcony-the-cia-watched-for-months-before-killing-him-5671915.html)) all feature the image and discuss the event.

The US military carried out the strike using Hellfire missiles. The CIA monitored al-Zawahiri for months before the strike. The image shows the building that was hit. ![image 6102](media/2025-08-29_19-41-1756496484-784350.jpg), ![image 6113](media/2025-08-29_19-41-1756496513-557804.jpg), ![image 6114](media/2025-08-29_19-41-1756496514-778179.jpg), ![image 6134](media/2025-08-29_19-42-1756496556-559044.jpg), ![image 6135](media/2025-08-29_19-42-1756496558-616239.jpg), ![image 6136](media/2025-08-29_19-42-1756496560-657221.jpg), and ![image 26](media/38.jpg).


### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources discuss the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, Iran, on July 31, 2024 (![image 26](media/38.jpg)). The assassination is reported by Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Ismail_Haniyeh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Ismail_Haniyeh)), CSIS ([https://www.csis.org/analysis/ismail-haniyehs-assassination-escalation-or-ramp](https://www.csis.org/analysis/ismail-haniyehs-assassination-escalation-or-ramp)), and CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/hamas-political-leader-haniyeh-killed-iran-07-31-24](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/hamas-political-leader-haniyeh-killed-iran-07-31-24)). The cause of death is under investigation, with reports varying from a missile strike to an explosion. The CSIS article mentions that Haniyeh was killed by an explosion in his guesthouse. The CNN article states that Israel has neither confirmed nor denied being behind the assassination.


### Evidence from `image_search`
CNN reports on an explosion in a building in Iran ([https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/01/middleeast/ismail-haniyeh-iran-explosion-bomb-planted-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/01/middleeast/ismail-haniyeh-iran-explosion-bomb-planted-intl)) ![image 6228](media/2025-08-29_19-46-1756496779-905787.jpg). Axios published an article about the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh ([https://www.axios.com/2024/07/31/us-hamas-leader-assassination-gaza-hostage-ceasefire-deal](https://www.axios.com/2024/07/31/us-hamas-leader-assassination-gaza-hostage-ceasefire-deal)) ![image 6232](media/2025-08-29_19-46-1756496782-535025.jpg).


## Elaboration
The claim is demonstrably false. The image provided in the claim is associated with the assassination of al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri in Kabul, Afghanistan, on July 31, 2022, not the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh. The evidence indicates that the image depicts the aftermath of a US drone strike using Hellfire missiles. The claim also incorrectly states the date and location of the event.


## Final Judgement
The image in the claim is associated with the assassination of Ayman al-Zawahiri in Kabul, Afghanistan, on July 31, 2022, not the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh. The claim misrepresents the event, date, and location. `false`
