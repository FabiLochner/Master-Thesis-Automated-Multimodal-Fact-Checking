The claim 'The US reinstituted draft in 2024 for the Israel-Hamas war.' is false.
Justification: The fact-check found no evidence to support the claim that the US reinstituted the draft in 2024 for the Israel-Hamas war. While there were discussions about the possibility of a draft and the US's involvement in the conflict, such as vetoing UN resolutions, no sources confirm the claim.

So, the overall veracity is: false
