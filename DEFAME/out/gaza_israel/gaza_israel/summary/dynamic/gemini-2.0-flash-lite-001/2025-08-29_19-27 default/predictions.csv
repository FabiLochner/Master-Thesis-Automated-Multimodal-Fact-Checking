Two of them were stopped near Rosh Hanikra and Nahariya, while the third detonated in Caesarea, a coastal town famous for its luxury homes and ancient Roman remains. At the time, the prime minister and his wife were away from the residence. We found similar updates in reports by India TV, Mint and India Today. None of them mentioned any casualties. Further, we checked Yair’s social media handles and analysed his online activity. We found that Yair Netanyahu's account is active on X. His latest activity was seen on October 21 with a repost of an interview of a Hezbollah leader. We also found Yair’s Instagram account. Although his last post was on October 7, he shared his latest status 10 hours ago. We checked Yair’s Facebook account; his last activity was on October 8. Hence, the claim that the Hezbollah drone attack on the Israeli PM’s home in Caesarea killed his son Yair Netanyahu is false."

94,"<image:61> This image shows a Palestinian girl in the Gaza war in July 2024. She was holding her sister's oxygen mask inside the ambulance. She had already passed away, yet her hand remained on the mask firmly.",False,False,True,"The image in the claim is from 2018 and depicts a Syrian girl, not a Palestinian girl in the Gaza war in July 2024. The image is associated with a reported gas attack in the eastern Ghouta region of Syria, as evidenced by sources like a VOA News article ([https://www.voanews.com/a/syria-russia-us-chemical-attacks/4221637.html](https://www.voanews.com/a/syria-russia-us-chemical-attacks/4221637.html)) and an ABC News article ([https://abcnews.go.com/International/tillerson-russia-ultimately-bears-responsibility-chemical-attacks-syria/story?id=52554201](https://abcnews.go.com/International/tillerson-russia-ultimately-bears-responsibility-chemical-attacks-syria/story?id=52554201)).
"," Old Photo Shows Suffocated Girls from Syria, Not Gaza. Contrary to social media users’ viral claim, the photo is not recent and unrelated to Gaza. The photo dates back to 2018 and was shot in the town of Douma, Syria. Photographer Hasan Mohamed shot the photo for AFP and was uploaded to Getty Images. The photo’s caption indicates that the photo features a Syrian girl holding an oxygen mask over an infant's face at a makeshift hospital in the town of Douma in eastern Ghouta, near the capital Damascus. The photo was taken in a makeshift hospital after a reported gas attack on the area on January 22, 2018."
95,"<image:62> This image shows a man from Gaza holding the hand of his son killed in an Israeli bombing in July, 2024.",False,False,True,"The image in the claim is of a father in Turkey holding his deceased daughter's hand after an earthquake in February 2023, not a bombing in Gaza in July 2024, as stated in the claim. The photo was taken by Adem Altan and published by multiple news sources, including The Independent ([https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/turkey-earthquake-father-daughter-hold-hands-b2277655.html](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/turkey-earthquake-father-daughter-hold-hands-b2277655.html)).
"," Upon conducting a reverse image search, we found that several news outlets had published a wider version of the same photograph in February 2023, showing more of the surrounding devastation and debris. These reports stated that the image shows Mesut Hancer holding the hand of his 15-year-old daughter, Irmak, who had died in the earthquake that hit Kahramanmaraş, a city in Turkey, on February 7. We found the same photograph on Getty Images credited to Adem Altan of the Agence France-Presse. There are multiple similar photos of the scene from different angles on Getty Images. Contrary to claims, the image does not originate from Gaza and does not depict a father holding the hand of his son, who was purportedly killed in an Israeli bombing and trapped under the rubble of their house."
97,The US reinstituted draft in 2024 for the Israel-Hamas war.,False,False,True,"The fact-check found no evidence to support the claim that the US reinstituted the draft in 2024 for the Israel-Hamas war. While there were discussions about the possibility of a draft and the US's involvement in the conflict, such as vetoing UN resolutions, no sources confirm the claim.
"," The U.S. is not conscripting Americans into the military for the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. The video references a bill passed by the House that would automatically register 18- to 25-year-old men for the selective service, but the bill isn't law and doesn't automatically induct individuals into the armed forces. To reinstate a draft, Congress and the president would be required to act. There is no evidence the U.S. has begun forcing Americans to enlist in the military to fight in the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. The website for the Selective Service System – the federal agency that registers men and maintains a system for a potential draft – says there is currently no draft."
98,<image:64> This is an authentic image of Dwayne Johnson waring the Israeli flag in support of Israel.,False,False,True,"The claim is false. While Dwayne Johnson has expressed his views on the Israel-Palestine conflict, the image of him wearing the Israeli flag is fake, as reported by [Yahoo News](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/fact-check-fake-dwayne-johnson-234700368.html).
"," A close look at the image showed several discrepancies that indicated it could be generated via artificial intelligence. Johnson's left eye is misaligned with his right. His hand holding the placard is unusually large and distorted, and he appears to be holding the placard awkwardly. We also noticed a very different tattoo on his right arm in the viral image, which does not match his original tattoo, as seen on his official Instagram account (archived here). In reality, Dwayne Johnson has a tattoo resembling an animal skull — he had shared an image of him getting the tattoo in 2021 (archived here), saying that it was a ""bull tattoo."" This tattoo can also be seen on his right arm in a recent video (archived here) he posted on his X (formerly Twitter) account on July 1, 2024. Hive Moderation, an online AI detection tool, found this image to be 70.8 percent likely to contain AI-generated or deepfake content. "
99,<image:65> This is an authentic image of an elderly Palestinian women being attacked by an Israeli army dog in June 2024.,False,False,True,"The claim is false. The image depicting an Israeli army dog attacking an elderly Palestinian woman is digitally altered, as confirmed by the Cyberpeace Institute's fact-check. While there are documented instances of such attacks, the specific image is not authentic.
"," NewsMeter found that claim is misleading. The incident did occur but the image is AI-generated. Upon examination, the angle and the graphical aesthetics of the photo suggested that the photo might be AI-generated. Further inspection of the image revealed a watermark - IN.VISUALART - indicating its origin. The ‘Ps+ Ai’ notation signified that the image was created using Artificial Intelligence. A keyword search led to an Instagram post from six days ago, where the same photo was shared with a caption stating, “Al-Jazeera obtained leaked footage from a camera mounted by occupation soldiers on a police dog showing the dog attacking an elderly Palestinian woman in her home during an operation the occupation army was about to carry out in Jebalia camp weeks ago. Stop genocide - Ceasefire now- Save Gaza- free Palestine.” A follow-up video on the same channel, with the caption “Video shows Israeli military dog mauling elderly Palestinian woman amid army operation in Jabalia,” featured the elderly woman speaking about the attack. Different news outlets, including the Palestine Chronicle, reported the incident with the title “‘Israelis Set a Dog on Me’ – Video Shows Army Unleashing Dog on Elderly Palestinian Woman.” Hence, the claim is misleading. Although the incident did occur, the viral photo was created using Artificial Intelligence. There are clues in the image that is the focus of this fact check that the picture is not real -- the men's fingers appear abnormally elongated, and the ball of fire behind the Israeli flag appears to be in the sky beside the two World Trade Center towers. Lead Stories also ran the video through True Media, an AI-detection tool, which found substantial evidence that it was created using AI."
