Content: The search result from PesaCheck states that the image is fabricated. The original photo was taken on February 8, 2009, and shows Benjamin Netanyahu with his father. The article also mentions that the image was edited to make it appear as though Netanyahu was under surveillance.

The claim '<image:56> This image shows Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu inside his office and was captured and published by Hezbollah in August 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false.
