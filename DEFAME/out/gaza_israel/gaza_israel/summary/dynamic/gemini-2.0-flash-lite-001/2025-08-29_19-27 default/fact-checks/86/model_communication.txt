West Coast carrier USS _Abraham Lincoln_ (CVN-72) is setting sail to the Middle East from the Pacific to relieve the carrier USS _Theodore Roosevelt_ (CVN-71) and its strike group. guided-missile destroyers that intercepted cruise and ballistic missiles in the first combat use of the Standard Missile 3.

As of Monday, _Lincoln_ was operating in the vicinity of Hawaii following [its July 11 deployment](https://news.usni.org/2024/07/12/carrier-uss-abraham-lincoln-leaves-on-deployment-uss-theodore-roosevelt-now-in-the-middle-east)
 from San Diego and _TR_ was operating in the Persian Gulf, according to [USNI News Fleet and Marine Tracker](https://news.usni.org/2024/07/29/usni-news-fleet-and-marine-tracker-july-29-2024)
.

It’s unclear on the timing of the transition between the two strike groups. Eisenhower_ (CVN-69) and its escorts from being extended a third time, [USNI News first reported](https://news.usni.org/2024/06/21/uss-dwight-d-eisenhower-leaving-red-sea-pacific-carrier-heading-to-the-middle-east)
. The next East Coast carrier set to head to the region, USS _Harry S. Truman_ (CVN-75), is still off the East Coast and in the midst of its pre-deployment training, USNI News understands.

In addition, the three-ship Wasp Amphibious Ready Group with the embarked 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit is currently in the Eastern Mediterranean. The ARG, composed of USS _Wasp_ (LHD-1), USS _New York_ (LPD-21) and USS _Oak Hill_ (LSD-51), and the 24th MEU are in position in the event of a non-combatant evacuation of people from Lebanon, several defense officials have told USNI News.

The Pentagon also announced the deployment of unspecified fighter squadrons headed to the region.

“The Secretary of Defense has reiterated that the United States will protect our personnel and interests in the region, including our ironclad commitment to the defense of Israel,” reads the statement from the Pentagon.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
NPR reported on August 3, 2024, that the U.S. is sending more warships to the Middle East as Israel steps up attacks, with Israel expecting an attack from Iran and its allies (<image:6700>). USNI News reported on August 2, 2024, that the USS Abraham Lincoln is heading to the Middle East, and the three-ship Wasp Amphibious Ready Group is in the Eastern Mediterranean (<image:6703>). Military.com reported on September 20, 2024, about the increased U.S. military presence in the Middle East, including warships in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, and a shift in focus to the northern front against Hezbollah in Lebanon (<image:6713>).

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that U.S. warships were deployed to the Eastern Mediterranean in August and September 2024. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the warships were en route to the Lebanon coast or that their purpose was to support the IDF. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified based on the provided evidence.

The evidence does mention a shift in focus to the northern front against Hezbollah in Lebanon, which suggests a potential connection to the claim, but it does not confirm the claim's specific details.

To verify the claim, additional information is needed to confirm the destination of the warships and their specific mission.

The evidence confirms that U.S. warships were deployed to the Eastern Mediterranean in August and September 2024. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the warships were en route to the Lebanon coast or that their purpose was to support the IDF. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified based on the provided evidence.

The evidence does mention a shift in focus to the northern front against Hezbollah in Lebanon, which suggests a potential connection to the claim, but it does not confirm the claim's specific details.

To verify the claim, additional information is needed to confirm the destination of the warships and their specific mission.

KIEL, Germany (June 19, 2024) – The Blue Ridge-class command and control ship USS Mount Whitney (LCC 20) arrived in Kiel, Germany, for a scheduled port visit, June 19, 2024.  
  
The ship’s visit to Kiel completes its participation in Baltic Operations (BALTOPS) 24, and builds on the strong and enduring relationship between the United States and Germany. BALTOPS 24 is an annual joint, multinational maritime-focused exercise designed to enhance interoperability, capability, and cohesion among NATO Allies while maintaining freedom of navigation and defending the Baltic Sea region. USS Mount Whitney’s visit to Kiel marks the culmination of its participation in BALTOPS 24 as it travels across the Baltic Sea.  
  
During the USS Mount Whitney’s port visit, Sailors, Marines, and key leaders from the Baltic Region participated in a Post-Sail conference at the Kiel Naval Base, where the discussions centered around capturing the lessons learned from BALTOPS 24, as well as beginning to shape the subsequent iterations of BALTOPS. BALTOPS is an annual training exercise in the Baltic region, with each year building off of the progress from the previous years.  
  
For the duration of BALTOPS 24, Task Force 61/2 (TF 61/2) and Expeditionary Strike Group 2 (ESG-2) combined together as Commander Task Force 162 (CTF 162). CTF 162 was aboard the USS Mount Whitney, which served as the command and control center for the amphibious assault ship USS Wasp (LHD 1), the San Antonio-class amphibious transport dock USS New York (LPD 21) and embarked 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU), Special Operations Capable (SOC), all together referred to as the Wasp ARG-24th MEU (SOC). Embarked commands with the Wasp ARG consist of Amphibious Squadron Four, 24th MEU (SOC), Fleet Surgical Team 2, Tactical Air Control Squadron 22, Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron 28 and Beach Assault Unit 21.  
  
TF 61/2 was also working closely with NATO Allies throughout BALTOPS 24, to include members of the Spanish Navy aboard the multi-purpose amphibious assault ship-aircraft carrier Juan Carlos I (L 61), the Royal Netherlands Navy aboard the HNLMS Johan de Witt (L 801), and the French Navy aboard the Mistral class amphibious assault and command ship (L 9013).  
  
“The purpose of this \[BALTOPS\] is to enhance our relationships, it’s to continue to build on our interoperability, it’s to showcase the fact that we are committed to this Alliance, and that we are committed to maintaining maritime peace and stability in the Baltic region,” said Brig. Gen. Samuel Meyer, the Commanding General of TF 61/2, who served as the Commander, Landing Forces (CLF) for CTF 162 during BALTOPS 24. “We are indeed stronger together.”  
  
For the last two weeks, TF 61/2 and ESG-2 were underway on the USS Mount Whitney participating in BALTOPS 24. As one of NATO’s premier maritime-focused exercises, BALTOPS 24 aimed to enhance interoperability and cooperation among allied nations in a complex and dynamic maritime environment. BALTOPS 24 was divided into two at-sea training phases. Combat Enhancement Training (CET) and Force Integration Training (FIT) comprised the first phase, followed by the Final Tactical Phase of the Exercise (TACEX). During the CET/FIT phase, ships and aircraft rehearsed common tactics, techniques, and procedures under a scripted program of events, enabling them to safely operate together as a force. The exercise culminated with the TACEX phase, where forces shifted into a “free-play” portion, and commanders were given more freedom to run their own tactical programs. The TACEX phase was designed to better represent operating in real-world situations.  
  
Participating nations included Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Türkiye, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The exercise, in its 53rd iteration, provided a unique training opportunity that strengthened combined response capabilities critical to preserving the freedom of navigation and security in the Baltic Sea region. Participating nations exercised a myriad of capabilities that demonstrated the inherent flexibility of maritime forces, including amphibious operations, gunnery, anti-submarine, and air defense exercises, as well as mine clearance operations, explosive ordnance disposal, and diving and salvage operations.  
  
“What we practice together is the ability to be interoperable with NATO, and this is a fantastic thing that I believe NATO does better than anyone else, and it really showcases the ability to work together,” says Rear Adm. Benjamin Nicholson, the commander of ESG-2, serving as the Commander, Amphibious Task Force (CATF) for CTF 162 during BALTOPS 24. “This really highlights the interoperability of NATO, where we can take forces from one nation, and put them on a ship or in a country of another nation, and operate from there seamlessly. That’s our strength when we partner and work together because we are stronger together.”  
  
Unique to BALTOPS 24 was Sweden participating for the first time as a member of NATO. Sweden had participated in previous iterations of BALTOPS as a NATO partner, but BALTOPS 24 was the first time that Sweden participated as an official member of NATO. This year also included a robust medical training package, together with a mass casualty medical drill on several of the ships underway, complete with role players simulating injuries wearing realistic makeup that were treated by the ship’s corpsman and medical officers, showcasing the medical readiness of the ships’ medical teams. Additionally, BALTOPS 24 included a larger chaplaincy contribution in the exercise that was expanded to six participating nations, integrating the chaplains in the military exercises to practice spiritually supporting our key warfare advantage: our service members. Chaplains from Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Netherlands, Norway, Romania, and the United States participated in the exercise, and conducted several cross-deckings to other NATO surface ships, where they met with the service members on board and led religious services.  
  
These various training evolutions contributed to this year’s successful iteration of BALTOPS 24. Participants in this multinational maritime exercise created and sustained partnerships and practiced a broad range of mission areas to enhance the capabilities of the participating units. More importantly, this exercise strengthened their ability to operate as a cohesive joint and combined force and respond to emerging crises.  
  
Headquartered in Naples, Italy, U.S. Naval Forces Europe-Africa (NAVEUR-NAVAF) operates U.S. naval forces in the U.S. European Command (USEUCOM) and U.S. Africa Command (USAFRICOM) areas of responsibility. U.S. Sixth Fleet is permanently assigned to NAVEUR-NAVAF, and employs maritime forces through the full spectrum of joint and naval operations.  
  
For more than 80 years, NAVEUR-NAVAF has forged strategic relationships with Allies and partners, leveraging a foundation of shared values to preserve security and stability.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:55> This image shows U.S. warships being en route to the Lebanon coast in August 2024 to support the Israel Defence Forces (IDF)."

## Actions
```
web_search("US warships Lebanon coast August 2024")
image_search("US warships Lebanon coast")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
NPR reported on August 3, 2024, that the U.S. is sending more warships to the Middle East as Israel steps up attacks, with Israel expecting an attack from Iran and its allies (<image:6700>). USNI News reported on August 2, 2024, that the USS Abraham Lincoln is heading to the Middle East, and the three-ship Wasp Amphibious Ready Group is in the Eastern Mediterranean (<image:6703>). Military.com reported on September 20, 2024, about the increased U.S. military presence in the Middle East, including warships in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, and a shift in focus to the northern front against Hezbollah in Lebanon (<image:6713>).

The sources do not explicitly state that the warships are en route to the Lebanon coast to support the IDF.


### Evidence from `image_search`
The article from L'Orient-Le Jour discusses which American warships are en route to Lebanon. (<image:6716>) The Associated Press published an image of a U.S. warship. (<image:6717>) The search result from Stratfor contains an image of a U.S. warship. (<image:6718>)

The provided sources do not mention the image in the claim (<image:55>) or the claim's assertion that the warships were en route to the Lebanon coast in August 2024 to support the Israel Defence Forces (IDF).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that U.S. warships were deployed to the Eastern Mediterranean in August and September 2024. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the warships were en route to the Lebanon coast or that their purpose was to support the IDF. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified based on the provided evidence.

The evidence does mention a shift in focus to the northern front against Hezbollah in Lebanon, which suggests a potential connection to the claim, but it does not confirm the claim's specific details.

To verify the claim, additional information is needed to confirm the destination of the warships and their specific mission.

WASHINGTON  –  

For 75 years, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has been a force for peace that stared down the Soviet Union, prevented a larger war in the Balkans, joined in the fight against international terrorism and even now stands ready to defend all NATO territory from Russian aggression.

NATO remains a vital and crucial alliance, and leaders of political parties on both sides of the Atlantic agree that NATO must be deemed one of the most successful collective defense alliances in history.

The alliance grew out of the experiences of the 20th century when great power wars killed more than 100 million people. Western leaders put in place an international order to prevent that sort of cataclysm from happening again. Part of that order was NATO — a collective defense alliance.

President Joe Biden called NATO "the greatest military alliance in the history of the world." Since NATO's founding, U.S. officials of both political parties have credited the alliance with contributing to the security, prosperity and liberty of Americans — and the world. 

And polling this year by the Pew Research Center shows that, though roughly two-thirds of Americans hold a favorable view of NATO — still, that means a third of Americans hold unfavorable opinions about the alliance — a 4% increase since 2023.

This growing increase in isolationist sentiment in the United States is disturbing to leaders of the NATO nations.

Isolationism has a long history in the United States. In 1796, President George Washington wrote in his farewell address that "It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliance with any portion of the foreign world." He said this even though Washington probably knew better than most Americans that without an alliance with France in the American Revolution, Britain would have won.

When the United States entered [World War I](https://www.defense.gov/Spotlights/WWI/)
 in April 1917, it fought as an "associated" power alongside France and the United Kingdom. The associated power label still left some distance between the U.S. and any entangling alliance.

After the war, American isolationism in the 1920s and 1930s, in part, laid the groundwork for a far more destructive war.

During [World War II](https://www.defense.gov/Spotlights/WWII/)
, the U.S. was a full ally, alongside the U.K., the Soviet Union, China, France and many others.

That war was so horrific, and the weapons created so destructive, that there was vast support for collective defense. A total of 420,000 Americans were killed in World War II, with many, many more wounded. And the U.S. was fortunate compared to other Allies. The Soviet Union lost up to 25 million and the U.K. — with less than a third of the U.S. population — lost 450,900. Overall, officials estimate that 3% of the Earth's population died in World War II.

Moving forward, the development of atomic weapons meant those casualties would look small if the great powers were to go to war again.

The alliance may seem inevitable. But, as Biden said in remarks commemorating NATO's 75th anniversary, this success didn't happen by accident, nor was it inevitable.

**Candy vs. Communism**

NATO came into being with the signing of the Washington Treaty on April 9, 1949. The original members of the alliance were Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the U.K. and the U.S.

Even as Western leaders signed the treaty, U.S. and allied aircrews were winning the first battle of the Cold War: The Berlin Airlift.

At the end of World War II, the victorious Allied powers administered Germany — with the Americans in the South, the British to the North, the French in the Southwest and the Soviets in the East.

Berlin was a special case. Each of the four powers had a sector in the former Nazi capital, which was deep inside the Soviet quarter. On June 24, 1948, the Soviets cut off Allied ground, rail and river routes into the city.

The allies — primarily the U.S. — answered with a massive airlift called Operation Vittles that supplied the city of more than 2 million people with food, milk, medical supplies and coal. Aircraft landed with metronome-like regularity. Logisticians loaded and unloaded the aircraft with metronomic precision. The operation delivered more than 2.3 million tons of supplies on more than 277,000 flights into the besieged city through September 1949.

The flights brought in more than just necessities. Aircrews noticed children would gather to watch the planes land. One pilot, Air Force 1st Lt. Gail Halvorsen, attached parachutes to Hershey bars and launched them to the children. He became known as "the Candy Bomber." The gesture gave heart to Berliners of all ages. And it highlighted the difference between the two systems. While the Soviets wouldn't let milk for babies through a blockade, the Americans were dropping candy bars to children.

**Article 5**

The key to the Washington Treaty is Article 5, which pledges a collective response to an attack on any single member.

It goes like this, "The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defense recognized by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force."

The treaty never mentions the Soviet Union, but there was little doubt about who was the threat. NATO's first secretary general — Britain's Lord Ismay — said the alliance's purpose was "to keep the Soviet Union out, the Americans in, and the Germans down."

The alliance became a true deterrent to the Soviet Union. Proof of that came in 1955 when the Soviet Union created the Warsaw Pact. This was a forced pact of captive nations in the Soviet orbit formed in response to NATO.

NATO stood united when the Soviets crushed a rebellion in Hungary in 1956 when they erected the Berlin Wall in 1961, and when they crushed the democratic movement in Czechoslovakia in 1968.

While the Soviet Union denigrated NATO, claiming nations would do better for themselves in the Soviet orbit, the alliance continued to grow. In 1952, Greece and Turkey joined, and in 1955, West Germany. Spain joined in 1982.

This solidarity worked. The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 shredded the Iron Curtain. Three years later the Soviet Union itself imploded, and the nations of Eastern and Central Europe were free to choose their own courses. A total of 14 former communist nations — from Albania to Slovenia — hurried to join NATO.

**Shared Democratic Values**

NATO is more than a simple alliance of 32 nations. NATO countries share similar world views. "Today, we once more reaffirm that our shared democratic values — and our willingness to stand up for them — is what makes NATO the greatest military alliance in the history of the world," Biden said in March as he welcomed NATO's newest member, Sweden, into the alliance. "It is what draws nations to our cause. It is what underpins our unity."

NATO is not just the largest peacetime military alliance in the world, it is integral to American interests and well-being.

"Generation after generation, the United States and our fellow allies have chosen to come together to stand up for freedom and push back against aggression — knowing we are stronger, and the world is safer when we do," Biden said in a statement celebrating the 75th anniversary of NATO's founding.

**Relevant Today**

Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 highlighted NATO's importance. "Almost two years after Putin's [unprovoked invasion of Ukraine](https://www.defense.gov/Spotlights/Support-for-Ukraine/)
 — the most serious threat to transatlantic security in decades — NATO has grown stronger and more united than ever," Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III said following a meeting of defense ministers at NATO headquarters in Brussels this February.

If Putin is successful and Russia is able to conquer a neighboring nation — forcefully deposing a freely elected government — then other neighboring nations may be endangered.  "Putin is not going to stop at Ukraine," President Biden said alongside French President Emmanuel Macron after talks in Paris on June 8. "All of Europe will be threatened, we are not going to let that happen."  

The European NATO allies are aware of the dangers posed by Putin's expansionist tendencies. In 2014, when Russia first invaded Ukraine and occupied Crimea, only three NATO member states had achieved the alliance's goal of 2% of gross domestic product devoted to defense. This year, 24 nations are expected to at least make the 2% level and many nations are taking that percentage of expenditures as the floor, not the ceiling for defense appropriations. Last year saw the ninth consecutive rise in European and Canadian defense spending. And in 2024, NATO members in Europe will invest a total of $470 billion in defense.

So, what makes NATO worthwhile to the United States? After all, at 1.3 million active duty service members, almost 770,000 Reservists and a $800 billion budget, the U.S. has the largest, best-funded military in NATO.

On the other hand, Russia has roughly 1.15 million active-duty personnel and another 800,000 reservists.

But the alliance is about more than how many troops any one nation can bring to the fight.

NATO's members have a collective defense budget that's north of $1.2 trillion. NATO nations share advanced training, tactics, equipment and often, weapons platforms. There are also NATO's overflight agreements, basing arrangements, intelligence-sharing protocols, common command structures and day-to-day familiarity with each other. Critically, NATO can maintain and sustain its forces.

And about those troop numbers: The 32 NATO nations together have about 3,368,000 active-duty personnel, and each NATO nation has its own reserve forces, along with some paramilitary formations. This is deterrence in the flesh.

**NATO Around the World**

The alliance is addressing more than just threats from Russia. NATO has reached out to nations such as Australia, New Zealand and Japan as it watches moves by China in the Asia-Pacific, as well as in Africa and, increasingly, the Arctic. NATO has a program to work with Mediterranean nations. The alliance is addressing cyber threats and the moral use of artificial intelligence.

The Cold War wasn't won by political parties, but by all Americans and all citizens of NATO countries. The unity of the alliance was important to ending the Cold War, but so was American leadership and will, as U.S. presidents from Bill Clinton to George W. Bush to Joe Biden said.

The alliance has had widespread U.S. support since its founding in 1949. But there are calls for isolationism — of America going it alone. In an interconnected world, this isn't possible.

The only time NATO invoked Article 5 of the Washington Treaty was when terrorists attacked the U.S. on Sept. 11, 2001. NATO personnel fought and died alongside American forces in Afghanistan.

Secretary Austin has noted that America's greatest asymmetric advantage over any competitor is its network of allies and partners. NATO is the jewel in the crown.

"Our allies magnify our strength and expand our security," Austin said in Brussels. "America's network of allies and partners worldwide — built and sustained by wise administrations of both parties in the decades since the nightmare of World War II — remains a core strategic strength that no rival can match — and that none should doubt."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
NPR reported on August 3, 2024, that the U.S. is sending more warships to the Middle East as Israel steps up attacks, with Israel expecting an attack from Iran and its allies (<image:6700>). USNI News reported on August 2, 2024, that the USS Abraham Lincoln is heading to the Middle East, and the three-ship Wasp Amphibious Ready Group is in the Eastern Mediterranean (<image:6703>). Military.com reported on September 20, 2024, about the increased U.S. military presence in the Middle East, including warships in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, and a shift in focus to the northern front against Hezbollah in Lebanon (<image:6713>).

The sources do not explicitly state that the warships are en route to the Lebanon coast to support the IDF.


### Evidence from `image_search`
The article from L'Orient-Le Jour discusses which American warships are en route to Lebanon. (<image:6716>) The Associated Press published an image of a U.S. warship. (<image:6717>) The search result from Stratfor contains an image of a U.S. warship. (<image:6718>)

The provided sources do not mention the image in the claim (<image:55>) or the claim's assertion that the warships were en route to the Lebanon coast in August 2024 to support the Israel Defence Forces (IDF).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that U.S. warships were deployed to the Eastern Mediterranean in August and September 2024. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the warships were en route to the Lebanon coast or that their purpose was to support the IDF. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified based on the provided evidence.

The evidence does mention a shift in focus to the northern front against Hezbollah in Lebanon, which suggests a potential connection to the claim, but it does not confirm the claim's specific details.

To verify the claim, additional information is needed to confirm the destination of the warships and their specific mission.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
NPR reported on August 3, 2024, that the U.S. is sending more warships to the Middle East as Israel steps up attacks, with Israel expecting an attack from Iran and its allies (<image:6700>). USNI News reported on August 2, 2024, that the USS Abraham Lincoln is heading to the Middle East, and the three-ship Wasp Amphibious Ready Group is in the Eastern Mediterranean (<image:6703>). Military.com reported on September 20, 2024, about the increased U.S. military presence in the Middle East, including warships in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, and a shift in focus to the northern front against Hezbollah in Lebanon (<image:6713>).

The sources do not explicitly state that the warships are en route to the Lebanon coast to support the IDF.


### Evidence from `image_search`
The article from L'Orient-Le Jour discusses which American warships are en route to Lebanon. (<image:6716>) The Associated Press published an image of a U.S. warship. (<image:6717>) The search result from Stratfor contains an image of a U.S. warship. (<image:6718>)

The provided sources do not mention the image in the claim (<image:55>) or the claim's assertion that the warships were en route to the Lebanon coast in August 2024 to support the Israel Defence Forces (IDF).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that U.S. warships were deployed to the Eastern Mediterranean in August and September 2024. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the warships were en route to the Lebanon coast or that their purpose was to support the IDF. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified based on the provided evidence.

The evidence does mention a shift in focus to the northern front against Hezbollah in Lebanon, which suggests a potential connection to the claim, but it does not confirm the claim's specific details.

To verify the claim, additional information is needed to confirm the destination of the warships and their specific mission.

US orders strike group to accelerate deployment to Middle East amid fears of Iran attack on Israel

Secretary of defence also announces deployment of guided missile submarine, as Hamas appears to push back against resuming ceasefire negotiations

The US has ordered a strike group of fighter jets and navy warships to accelerate its deployment to the Middle East, as the region braces for possible attacks by Iran and its allies after the killing of senior members of [Hamas](https://www.theguardian.com/world/hamas)
 and Hezbollah.

The US secretary of defence, Lloyd Austin, ordered the Abraham Lincoln strike group to [accelerate its deployment to the region](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/03/us-bolsters-military-presence-in-middle-east-as-threat-of-regional-escalation-intensifies)
, while at the same time announcing the deployment of a guided missile submarine, after speaking with his Israeli counterpart, Yoav Gallant.

Analysts noted that it was rare for the Pentagon to publicly announce the deployment of a submarine.

The US military had already said it would deploy additional fighter jets and warships to the Middle East as Washington seeks to bolster Israeli defences. Iran has blamed Israel for the killing, but Israel has not claimed responsibility.

Haniyeh’s assassination and the killing of the [senior military commander of the Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah, Fuad Shukr](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/30/beirut-suburbs-hit-in-airstrike-targeting-hezbollah-commander-israel-says)
, by Israel in a strike on Beirut, have fuelled concerns the conflict in Gaza could turn into a wider Middle East war.

It comes as Hamas appeared to push back against resuming ceasefire negotiations. Washington and regional mediators have since tried arranging the Gaza ceasefire-for-hostages deal but have run into repeated obstacles.

 a carrier strike group, a fighter squadron and additional warships to the Middle East as the region braces for possible Iranian retaliation to the killing of a senior Hamas leader in Tehran earlier this week.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ordered the USS Abraham Lincoln strike group to replace the USS Theodore Roosevelt strike group, which is currently operating in the Gulf of Oman, according to a statement from deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh.

Destroyers and cruisers capable of ballistic missile defense will also be sent to the Middle East and the Mediterranean Sea. “We’ve got to make sure we’ve got the right resources and capabilities in the region.”

On a call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday, the White House said President Joe Biden “reaffirmed his commitment to Israel’s security against all threats from Iran, including its proxy terrorist groups Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis.”

Kirby said Friday that that support would likely come in the form of both personnel and hardware in the region.

The Turkish flag is seen at half-staff at the Turkish embassy in Tel Aviv, Israel, on August 2.

CNN

A decision by the Turkish embassy in Tel Aviv to fly its flag half-staff as part of Turkey’s national day of mourning for [Hamas’ political leader Ismail Haniyeh](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/31/middleeast/ismail-haniyeh-death-hamas-profile-intl-hnk/index.html)
 has left members of the Israeli government and public enraged. 

Foreign Minister Israel Katz summoned Turkey’s deputy ambassador for a “stern reprimand” after the move, saying Israel “will not accept expressions of sympathy for a murderer like Ismail Haniyeh.“

The Israeli far-right national security minister Itamar Ben Gvir called for the expulsion of the ambassador, saying Turkey’s lowering of the flag as a “tribute” to Haniyeh “shows exactly what they think of us.” 

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Friday will be a national day of mourning for Haniyeh, who was assassinated in the Iranian capital Tehran this week. He was [assassinated](http://www.cnn.com/2024/07/30/middleeast/hamas-political-leader-ismail-haniyeh-killed-intl-hnk)

The [US decision to send warships and fighter squadron to the Middle East](https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/02/politics/us-warships-middle-east-brace-iranian-retaliation/index.html)
 will mark perhaps the largest movement of US forces to the region since the early days of the Gaza war, when the Pentagon sent two carrier strike groups toward the Middle East in a very public warning to regional militant groups not to expand the fighting.

The region is bracing for an Iranian retaliation after the country’s supreme leader vowed to attack Israel for the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran earlier this week. Officials said the attack may be similar to the barrage of ballistic missiles and drones [Iran launched against Israel in April,](https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/13/middleeast/iran-drones-attack-israel-intl-latam/index.html)
 but it could also be larger and more complex, coordinated with Iranian proxies in the region. 

Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah hinted that a coordinated attack on Israel could be in the works after Israel assassinated one of the Iran-backed group’s top commanders in Beirut less than 24 hours before the killing of Haniyeh. 

“Because they have picked a fight with everyone, they don’t know where the response will come from … the response will come separately or coordinated,” he said in a speech Thursday.

Dutch airline KLM is canceling its planned flights to Tel Aviv until at least October in response to the “security situation the region,” a press officer for KLM said in a statement to CNN.

The airline previously announced it was canceling flights into the Israeli capital until August 31.

KLM joins a growing list of international airlines suspending flights into and out of the Middle East.

US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin will direct “multiple force posture moves” in the Middle East ahead of a possible attack by Iran on Israel, according to the Pentagon.

Austin spoke to Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on Friday and “informed the minister of additional measures to include ongoing and future defense force posture changes that the department will take to support the defense of Israel,” deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh said Friday.

Singh declined to detail the potential moves, saying that Austin would be directing those moves “at a later time.” But the US has a number of naval assets already in the region, including a carrier strike group in the Gulf of Oman and amphibious assault ships and destroyers in the eastern Mediterranean.

A US official separately told CNN that the additional capabilities would likely include more air defense systems to help protect Israel and US forces from a potential Iranian attack. 

Singh noted that there “could be additional” US troops that enter the region to help bolster US forces there but declined to outline specific capabilities or units that may be deployed. 

CNN reported on Thursday the Pentagon discussed with US Central Command what adjustments to make to US force posture in the region. In July, the UN warned of widespread famine across [the strip](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/09/middleeast/gaza-famine-un-report-intl-latam/index.html)
, and relief workers say Israeli aid restrictions mean they are unable to support Palestinians. 

Raghad Ezzat Hamouda, a Palestinian displaced in Beit Lahia in northern Gaza, told CNN that the past nine months have been engulfed by “fear and terror.” 

“This situation has become very dangerous, as hundreds of children die every day,” the 19-year-old said on Friday. “Legally, there is no reason for his detention,” he said, adding this is a “political persecution.”

Sabri’s detention came after Israeli Minister of Interior Moshe Arbel called to revoke his residency in a letter to the attorney general on Friday, arguing he “does not identify with the state \[of Israel\] and its citizens, but on the contrary, seeks to destroy them.”

The Israeli police also issued a statement saying it is opening an investigation following the Friday prayer to “determine whether there is a suspicion of incitement against the relevant authorities.” Ben Gvir welcomed the investigation and described Sabri’s speech as “inflammatory.”

**Some context:** During Friday’s sermon, Sabri briefly made a prayer that God accept Ismail Haniyeh as a “martyr” and announced an absentee funeral prayer for him and others who have been killed will be held after the sermon, which did not involve any calls for violence.

The word “martyr” has been frequently used to refer to Palestinians killed by Israeli forces and was used in the same sermon in reference to killed Palestinians.

UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, Tor Wennesland, called for de-escalation in the Middle East after [Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/31/middleeast/what-we-know-iran-haniyeh-assassination-intl-hnk/index.html)
 was killed in Tehran on Wednesday.

Wennesland called for more effort to prevent any “further deterioration of the situation.”

He said it is “crucial that we act decisively and collectively to address the immediate threats and lay the groundwork for a lasting peace,” adding “I will continue my active engagement with all the relevant parties to support peace and stability in the region.” 

**Some context:** Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei [said Wednesday it was Iran’s “duty”](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/30/middleeast/hamas-political-leader-ismail-haniyeh-killed-intl-hnk/index.html)
 to avenge the death in Tehran of Hamas’ political leader Ismail Haniyeh, an assassination that Iran blamed on Israel. Only 14 out of 36 hospitals remain partially operational.

Mohsen warned he is “exhausted and burned out,” as he struggles to balance shifts that last for more than 60 hours – while caring for his mother, a chronic kidney disease patient, and his father, who is recovering from a stroke.

French Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin has asked police to reinforce security for the Jewish community amid an escalation in tensions in the Middle East and Hamas’ announcement of a “day of rage.”

In a memo, Darmanin says there’s a “real risk of someone taking action,” especially given the presence of “a number of Israeli nationals” on French soil during the Paris Olympics. 

Hamas called for the “day of rage” to coincide with Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh’s burial on Friday.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Friday that a projectile fired from southern Gaza fell in an open area near the Israeli town of Kiryat Malakhi, about 30 kilometers (18 miles) north of the enclave.

There are no reports of casualties or damage.

The launch of rockets from Gaza has become less frequent in recent months, and very few have travelled such a great distance.

French visitors who still happen to be in Iran should “leave as soon as possible” because of the heightened risk of military escalation in the region, the foreign ministry said Friday.  

The statement reiterated that the whole of Iran “is marked as red on the travel advisory map”, meaning “French nationals are strongly advised not to travel to Iran for any reason whatsoever.”

The warning comes amid heightened tensions and fears of retaliatory strikes between Iran and Israel.

Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei [said Wednesday it was Iran’s “duty”](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/30/middleeast/hamas-political-leader-ismail-haniyeh-killed-intl-hnk/index.html)
 to avenge the death in Tehran of Hamas’ political leader Ismail Haniyeh, an assassination that Iran blamed on Israel.

According to the New York Times, which cited information provided by three Iranian officials, Khamenei issued an order for Iran to “strike Israel directly” following the killing."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
NPR reported on August 3, 2024, that the U.S. is sending more warships to the Middle East as Israel steps up attacks, with Israel expecting an attack from Iran and its allies (<image:6700>). USNI News reported on August 2, 2024, that the USS Abraham Lincoln is heading to the Middle East, and the three-ship Wasp Amphibious Ready Group is in the Eastern Mediterranean (<image:6703>). Military.com reported on September 20, 2024, about the increased U.S. military presence in the Middle East, including warships in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, and a shift in focus to the northern front against Hezbollah in Lebanon (<image:6713>).

The sources do not explicitly state that the warships are en route to the Lebanon coast to support the IDF.


### Evidence from `image_search`
The article from L'Orient-Le Jour discusses which American warships are en route to Lebanon. (<image:6716>) The Associated Press published an image of a U.S. warship. (<image:6717>) The search result from Stratfor contains an image of a U.S. warship. (<image:6718>)

The provided sources do not mention the image in the claim (<image:55>) or the claim's assertion that the warships were en route to the Lebanon coast in August 2024 to support the Israel Defence Forces (IDF).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that U.S. warships were deployed to the Eastern Mediterranean in August and September 2024. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the warships were en route to the Lebanon coast or that their purpose was to support the IDF. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified based on the provided evidence.

The evidence does mention a shift in focus to the northern front against Hezbollah in Lebanon, which suggests a potential connection to the claim, but it does not confirm the claim's specific details.

To verify the claim, additional information is needed to confirm the destination of the warships and their specific mission.

U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin had approved sending additional Navy cruisers and destroyers-- which can shoot down ballistic missiles-- to the Middle East and Europe.

It is also sending an additional squadron of fighter jets to the Middle East.

"Austin has ordered adjustments to U.S. force protection, to increase support for the defense of Israel, and to ensure the United States is prepared to respond to various contingencies," the Pentagon said in a statement.

There had been speculation that the Pentagon might not replace the USS Theodore Roosevelt carrier strike group in the Middle East once it completed its ongoing deployment. From Karachi, Pakistan.

WASHINGTON, Aug 2 (Reuters) - The U.S. Still, the threat from Hezbollah in Lebanon could present unique challenges to any efforts by the United States to intercept drones and missiles given the group's vast arsenal and immediate proximity to Israel.

At the time, Israel successfully [knocked down](/world/after-israel-defense-us-sees-chance-entice-gulf-allies-missile-shield-2024-05-22/)
 almost all of the roughly 300 drones and missiles with the help of the United States and other allies.

Biden, in a phone call on Thursday with Netanyahu, discussed new U.S. defensive military deployments to support Israel against threats such as missiles and drones, the White House said.

Iran and Hamas have both accused Israel of carrying out the killing and have pledged to retaliate against their foe. Israel has not claimed responsibility for the death nor denied it.

Haniyeh's death was one in a series of killings of senior Hamas figures as the war in Gaza between Hamas and Israel nears its 11th month and concern grows that the conflict is spreading across the Middle East.

Earlier, Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said the U.S."

# Instructions
You just retrieved new Evidence. Now, **analyze the Claim's veracity using the evidence**. Always adhere to the following rules:
* Focus on developing new insights. Do not repeat larger parts from the Record. Do not restate the Claim.
* Write down your thoughts step-by-step. Whenever necessary, you may elaborate in more detail.
* Depending on the topic's complexity, invest one to three paragraphs. The fewer, the better.
* If you find that there is insufficient information to verify the Claim, explicitly state what information is missing.
* If you cite web sources, always refer to them by including their URL as a Markdown hyperlink.
* **Use information only from the recorded evidence**: Avoid inserting information that is not implied by the evidence. You may use commonsense knowledge, though.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:55> This image shows U.S. warships being en route to the Lebanon coast in August 2024 to support the Israel Defence Forces (IDF)."

## Actions
```
web_search("US warships Lebanon coast August 2024")
image_search("US warships Lebanon coast")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
NPR reported on August 3, 2024, that the U.S. is sending more warships to the Middle East as Israel steps up attacks, with Israel expecting an attack from Iran and its allies (<image:6700>). USNI News reported on August 2, 2024, that the USS Abraham Lincoln is heading to the Middle East, and the three-ship Wasp Amphibious Ready Group is in the Eastern Mediterranean (<image:6703>). Military.com reported on September 20, 2024, about the increased U.S. military presence in the Middle East, including warships in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, and a shift in focus to the northern front against Hezbollah in Lebanon (<image:6713>).

The sources do not explicitly state that the warships are en route to the Lebanon coast to support the IDF.


### Evidence from `image_search`
The article from L'Orient-Le Jour discusses which American warships are en route to Lebanon. (<image:6716>) The Associated Press published an image of a U.S. warship. (<image:6717>) The search result from Stratfor contains an image of a U.S. warship. (<image:6718>)

The provided sources do not mention the image in the claim (<image:55>) or the claim's assertion that the warships were en route to the Lebanon coast in August 2024 to support the Israel Defence Forces (IDF).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that U.S. warships were deployed to the Eastern Mediterranean in August and September 2024. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the warships were en route to the Lebanon coast or that their purpose was to support the IDF. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified based on the provided evidence.

The evidence does mention a shift in focus to the northern front against Hezbollah in Lebanon, which suggests a potential connection to the claim, but it does not confirm the claim's specific details.

To verify the claim, additional information is needed to confirm the destination of the warships and their specific mission.

TEL AVIV, July 19 (Reuters) - A long-range Iranian-made drone hit the centre of Tel Aviv in the early hours of Friday in an attack claimed by the Yemen-based [Houthi](/world/middle-east/who-are-yemens-houthis-why-are-they-under-attack-2024-01-12/)
 militia that killed one man and wounded four others, the Israeli military and emergency services said.

The explosion, which footage shared on social media suggested came from the sea and did not trigger air raid alarms, occurred hours after the Israeli military [confirmed](/world/middle-east/commander-hezbollahs-radwan-forces-killed-israeli-strike-south-lebanon-two-2024-07-18/)
 it had killed a senior commander of the Iran-backed Hezbollah militia in southern Lebanon.

Chief spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said the military assessed that the drone, which hit a building near the beachfront close to U.S. "We must be prepared for defensive and offensive actions," he said, according to a statement from his office.

An Israeli official said the military was still investigating why the drone did not trigger the alarm, but initial reports suggested the aircraft was identified but the sirens were not sounded due to human error.

"We're talking about a large UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) that can fly large distances," the military official told journalists after the strike.

**\[1/12\]**A man looks at a building damaged at the site of an explosion, amid the Israel-Hamas conflict in Tel Aviv, Israel July 19, 2024. Embassy premises in Tel Aviv, was an upgraded Iranian-made Samad-3 model.

"Our estimation is that it arrived from Yemen to Tel Aviv," he told a press briefing.

A spokesman for the Houthis, which like Hezbollah are aligned with Iran, said the group had attacked Tel Aviv with a drone and would continue to target Israel in solidarity with Palestinians in the Gaza war.

The attack, which took place ahead of a visit to Washington by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu next week, is likely to fan fears about further fallout from the Gaza war as the Houthis and other Iranian proxies side with the Palestinian militant group Hamas.

Defence Minister Yoav Gallant met military commanders to review air defences and said the country had to be ready for all scenarios. All of them were later released, health services said.

Israel has been exchanging daily missile and artillery fire with Hezbollah along its northern border and in southern Lebanon since the start of the war in Gaza, prompting fears of a wider regional conflict if the situation escalates.

The Houthis have also stepped up attacks against Israel and Western targets, saying they are acting in solidarity with the Palestinians, after Israel invaded the Gaza Strip following last year's attack by Hamas militants on southern Israel.

Hamas-led fighters stormed Israeli towns on Oct. The mayor of Tel Aviv said the city, Israel's economic centre, had been moved to a state of heightened alert.

In the hours following Friday's attack, sirens sounded repeatedly in areas close to the border with Lebanon and Israeli air defences intercepted at least one aerial target that crossed into Israel.

"OPERATION ACHIEVED ITS GOALS"
------------------------------

Houthi spokesperson Yahya Saree called Tel Aviv a primary target "within the range of our weapons".

He said the strike was carried out using a new drone called "Yafa", which he said was capable of bypassing interception systems and undetectable by radars.

"The operation has achieved its goals successfully," Saree said in a televised speech.

Israel's emergency services said the body of a 50 year-old man was found in an apartment close to the explosion and four people were taken to hospital with slight shrapnel injuries. Since then, nearly 39,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's assault on the Gaza Strip, according to health authorities in the enclave.

    ! His remarks followed a meeting with top military and intelligence officials to assess the strike.

The military identified the drone as an Iranian Samad-3, upgraded to travel long distances, and said it was believed to have come from Yemen.

The [Houthis](https://www.theguardian.com/world/houthi)
 claimed responsibility, saying their “UAV \[unmanned aerial vehicle\] force” attacked “one of the important targets in the occupied Jaffa region, what is now called Israeli Tel Aviv”.

Earlier this month, Israeli forces said they had detected a suspected Houthi drone headed for the Red Sea port of Eilat, which they shot down with a fighter jet.

The Iran-backed group has launched waves of attacks targeting shipping through the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, causing significant disruption and a sharp drop in business at the port of Eilat.

The Houthis have said they launched the attacks in response to Israeli attacks on Gaza, which have so far killed more than 38,000 people since the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel.

The drone attack shook residents of Tel Aviv, undermining a fragile sense of security as Israelis living close to the border with Lebanon increasingly fear incursions by drones or rockets sent by Hezbollah, while communities close to the border with Gaza remain on high alert for sporadic rocket fire.

Footage from the site in Tel Aviv showed broken glass strewn across the pavements as crowds of onlookers gathered near a building bearing blast marks. <image:2528>

[SKIP ADVERTISEMENT](#after-bottom) building, an attack that analysts assessed had possibly been an attempt by the Houthis to strike anywhere they could in Tel Aviv. The Houthis, an Iranian-backed militia that has been attacking ships in the Red Sea, claimed responsibility for the strike on the city of 450,000 people.

The Israeli military’s chief spokesman, Rear Adm. No air-raid sirens warned residents before the drone crashed into the building, causing an explosion that jolted people from their sleep, shattered windows and left shrapnel scattered on the streets.

“We are investigating why we did not identify it, attack it and intercept it,” Admiral Hagari said on Friday.

Another Israeli military official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity, said there was a possibility that human error had allowed the drone to penetrate Israeli airspace.

Israeli officials did not announce an immediate military response against the Houthis, who control much of northwestern Yemen. The group has attempted several attacks on southern Israel, but this one managed to reach farther into the country."

*   Over 40 airlines have canceled flights in and out of Israel amid the ongoing war.
*   At least 900 people have died in Israel following surprise attacks by Hamas militants.
*   Travelers in Israel say they've faced long lines and multiple canceled flights trying to get home.

 during which at least 687 Palestinians have been killed and 3,800 more have been injured, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.

The ongoing war has thrown Israel's travel industry into chaos
--------------------------------------------------------------

More than [40 airlines have canceled flights to and from the country](https://www.businessinsider.com/airlines-canceling-flights-to-israel-tel-aviv-2023-10)
.

"People are just scared and trying to get out," Lia Hershkovitz, who flew out of Ben Gurion airport on Sunday, told Insider.

Muki Portnoy, her husband, and three children were supposed to fly home to New Jersey on a United flight that was canceled. Their travel agent booked them another flight on Monday to Madrid via the Spanish carrier Iberia. On the shuttle ride to the airport after dropping off their rental car, Portnoy got a notification that their flight had been canceled, she said.

"When we arrived, the airport was just completely mobbed. Lines were out the door, almost," she said.

Portnoy and her husband looked for alternative flights. She said they were repeatedly waved away by airport workers, and that Israel's El Al airline wasn't letting anyone stand in line at the ticket counter unless they already had a reservation. (Insider has contacted the airline for comment.) She said their travel agent waitlisted their party of five on 40 different El Al flights, but none of them had available seats. 

She described the scene as "hundreds and hundreds of frustrated people. People crying. Lots and lots and lots of families just sitting on the floor, waiting around. Lots of long lines everywhere. People confused, not really sure where to go and what to do."

Portnoy's husband returned to the airport the following day, waiting in line for five hours until he secured tickets for a flight on Wednesday.

It took Hannah Zucherman three tries to book a flight out of Israel in her efforts to get home to San Francisco. She said the airline of the second flight she booked, on Turkish Airlines, didn't even notify her that it had been canceled. Instead, she says she found out by looking it up on Ben Gurion's website. Insider has contacted Turkish Airlines for comment.

When she did successfully buy a ticket and make it through security, she found the waiting areas eerily silent.

"Inside the terminal it was very quiet and folks were clearly on edge," Zucherman said. "Normally, there are kids running around and lots of noise. This time it was much more subdued."

Israelis trying to return home are also facing challenges
---------------------------------------------------------

Jerusalem resident Daniel Rosehill's El Al flight from Barcelona to Israel on Monday was delayed for a few hours, but he eventually made it to Israel.

"The cabin crew made a sort of somber announcement about these being difficult times and El Al being committed to bringing Israelis home," he told Insider. 

Rosehill said the arrivals terminal was "noticeably more quiet than usual, but otherwise business as normal." When he stepped off the plane, he noted signs indicating the nearest shelter from incoming rocket fire.

The Israel Airports Authority has not responded to Insider's request for comment.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.89, 'Palestine': 0.06, 'Jordan': 0.01, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0, 'Austria': 0.0, 'Bangladesh': 0.0}

### Evidence from `web_search`
On July 19, 2024, a Houthi drone attack hit Tel Aviv, Israel. The attack was reported by Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-military-says-tel-aviv-blast-apparently-caused-by-drone-2024-07-19/](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-military-says-tel-aviv-blast-apparently-caused-by-drone-2024-07-19/)), The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/19/yemen-houthis-claim-deadly-drone-attack-on-tel-aviv-israel](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/19/yemen-houthis-claim-deadly-drone-attack-on-tel-aviv-israel)), and The New York Times ([https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/world/middleeast/houthis-drone-strike-tel-aviv.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/world/middleeast/houthis-drone-strike-tel-aviv.html)).

The New York Times also included the image in the claim (<image:60>). The Guardian mentioned that police urged residents to "respect safety instructions".


### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image in the claim (<image:60>) appears in a Business Insider article from October 10, 2023, discussing flight cancellations and chaos at Ben Gurion Airport in Israel due to the war with Gaza. The image also appears in Getty Images stock photos of Ben Gurion Airport. Some images are dated from 2022, 2023, and 2024, and some are related to attacks by Palestinian factions, the Houthi group, and Iran. One image shows an Israeli security force taking measures after Yemen's Houthi group attacked Ben Gurion Airport on May 04, 2025.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is likely false. The image was taken at Ben Gurion Airport in Israel. While there was a Houthi attack on Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024, the image appears in a Business Insider article from October 10, 2023, and Getty Images stock photos, some of which predate the claimed event. The image is also associated with flight cancellations and chaos at Ben Gurion Airport due to the war with Gaza.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.89, 'Palestine': 0.06, 'Jordan': 0.01, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0, 'Austria': 0.0, 'Bangladesh': 0.0}

### Evidence from `web_search`
On July 19, 2024, a Houthi drone attack hit Tel Aviv, Israel. The attack was reported by Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-military-says-tel-aviv-blast-apparently-caused-by-drone-2024-07-19/](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-military-says-tel-aviv-blast-apparently-caused-by-drone-2024-07-19/)), The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/19/yemen-houthis-claim-deadly-drone-attack-on-tel-aviv-israel](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/19/yemen-houthis-claim-deadly-drone-attack-on-tel-aviv-israel)), and The New York Times ([https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/world/middleeast/houthis-drone-strike-tel-aviv.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/world/middleeast/houthis-drone-strike-tel-aviv.html)).

The New York Times also included the image in the claim (<image:60>). The Guardian mentioned that police urged residents to "respect safety instructions".


### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image in the claim (<image:60>) appears in a Business Insider article from October 10, 2023, discussing flight cancellations and chaos at Ben Gurion Airport in Israel due to the war with Gaza. The image also appears in Getty Images stock photos of Ben Gurion Airport. Some images are dated from 2022, 2023, and 2024, and some are related to attacks by Palestinian factions, the Houthi group, and Iran. One image shows an Israeli security force taking measures after Yemen's Houthi group attacked Ben Gurion Airport on May 04, 2025.

## Elaboration
The claim is likely false. The image was taken at Ben Gurion Airport in Israel. While there was a Houthi attack on Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024, the image appears in a Business Insider article from October 10, 2023, and Getty Images stock photos, some of which predate the claimed event. The image is also associated with flight cancellations and chaos at Ben Gurion Airport due to the war with Gaza.

Syria, Russia Accuse US of Lying About Chemical Weapons Attacks

Print

STATE DEPARTMENT — 

Syria and Russia on Wednesday accused the United States of lying about chemical weapons attacks in the Syrian conflict as a way of derailing efforts to bring an end to the fighting.

Syria's state-run SANA news agency carried comments from a Foreign Ministry source condemning what it called "lies and allegations" by U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian.

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told the Interfax news agency that whenever peace efforts advance, the United States promotes "rigged, unverified reports" of chemical weapons attacks in Syria.

Those comments came a day after the United States joined its NATO allies in launching a pressure campaign against the use of chemical weapons in Syria, while singling out Russia for protecting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government.

"The recent attacks in East Ghouta raise serious concerns that Bashar al-Assad’s Syrian regime might be continuing its use of chemical weapons against its own people," Tillerson said at a Paris conference hosted by Le Drian.

Tillerson said at least 20 people were killed Monday in an apparent chlorine gas attack in rebel-held East Ghouta, near Damascus.  
  
"Whoever conducted the attacks, Russia ultimately bears responsibility for the victims in East Ghouta and countless other Syrians targeted with chemical weapons since Russia became involved in Syria," he said.

A Syrian boy holds an oxygen mask over the face of an infant at a makeshift hospital following a reported gas attack on the rebel-held besieged town of Douma in the eastern Ghouta region on the outskirts of the capital Damascus, Jan. 22, 2018.

Tillerson, along with foreign ministers from France, Germany and Turkey, were among those who launched the International Partnership Against Impunity for Use of Chemical Weapons on Tuesday. More than two dozen like-minded nations endorsed a political commitment to share information on combating the use of chemical weapons worldwide.

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson delivers a speech during a foreign ministers' meeting on the International Partnership against Impunity for the Use of Chemical Weapons, in Paris, Jan. 23, 2018.

The U.S. secretary of state noted Russia's failure to resolve the chemical weapons issue in Syria calls into question its commitment to the resolution of the overall crisis.

"At a very minimum, Russia must stop vetoing and at least abstain from future security council votes on this issue," Tillerson said.

In November, Russia vetoed the renewal of an independent and technical group created by the U.N. Security Council, the so-called Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM), to look into the perpetrators of chemical weapons attacks in Syria.  
  
"When Russia killed the JIM, they sent a dangerous message to the world — one that not only said chemical weapons use is acceptable but also that those who use chemical weapons don’t need to be identified or held accountable," U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said in a statement Tuesday.  
  
**Concern about Turkey's Afrin offensive**  
  
Turkey's offensive in the northern Syrian enclave of Afrin was also a focus of Tuesday's talks in Paris, with Tillerson meeting with his Turkish counterpart, Mevlut Cavusoglu. A day earlier, during remarks in London, the top U.S. diplomat said the United States is "concerned" about the offensive against U.S.-backed Kurdish YPG fighters in Syria.

Turkish army tanks enter Afrin, an enclave in northern Syria controlled by U.S.-allied Kurdish fighters, in Hassa, Hatay, Turkey, Jan. 22, 2018.

  
Turkish forces intensified military operations on Monday to push the Kurdish militia out of the Afrin area.

The Turkish operation is aimed at ousting from Afrin the Syrian Kurdish group that has controlled territory in northern Syria and proven effective in the U.S.-coalition-led fight against Islamic State militants.

Turkey considers the YPG to be a terrorist organization associated with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party or PKK, which has fought for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey.

French Foreign Minister Le Drian on Tuesday joined Tillerson in expressing his concern about Turkey’s military operation in Afrin.

"I had the opportunity to tell my Turkish colleague that this offensive worries us," Le Drian said.

"While we understand the concerns Turkey has about border security, we cannot but call on Turkey to show the greatest level restraint on this issue," the French foreign minister added.

Turkey's shelling into Afrin came after the U.S.-led coalition said it would form a 30,000-strong Kurdish-led border security force in northern Syria.

Washington later said the effort had been mischaracterized and that the United States was not creating a border force, but that the coalition would provide security to liberated areas, blocking escape routes for Islamic State militants.

#### **The Issue**

*   _The international community’s failure to deter or punish Syrian president Bashar al-Assad’s use of chemical weapons risks incentivizing the use of chemical weapons by others._
    *   _Assad’s use of chemical weapons has highlighted their military effectiveness and undermined the norms prohibiting their use._
*   _Increasing multipolarity has made international accountability more challenging._
*   _Actors are likely to challenge existing norms by gradually escalating their chemical weapons use from riot-control agents to toxic industrial chemicals or pharmaceutical-based agents while spreading disinformation and impeding evidence collection._
*   _The United States should strengthen detection and accountability mechanisms to deter future chemical weapons usage._
    *   _It should work with allies and partners to prioritize the early detection and prevention of chemical weapons development, develop backchannels to establish deterrence, and define clear red lines against chemical weapons usage._

#### **Introduction**

On August 21, 2013, Syrian president Bashar al-Assad’s army killed an estimated 1,400 people in Eastern Ghouta with sarin gas. It was the first use of chemical weapons in the Middle East in 25 years, but not the last. As he battled a dogged insurgency, Assad used sarin in another mass casualty event; he has used chlorine gas nearly 350 times.\[1\]

Following the 2013 Ghouta attack, international outrage prompted efforts to eliminate Syria’s chemical arsenal with Russia’s cooperation. Yet, accountability for war crimes has faded from the international spotlight, as has Russian cooperation to investigate and attribute chemical weapons attacks in Syria. Assad won back most of his territory and has reentered the Arab League. He transgressed international norms and survived. Assad’s success may push adversaries and allies of the United States alike to consider using chemical weapons as he did.

> Assad’s success may push adversaries and allies of the United States alike to consider using chemical weapons as he did.

If such a thing happened, it would have a precedent. During the Cold War, four Arab states embarked on chemical weapons programs, with Egypt taking a pioneering role in both development and usage in the 1960s. The Egyptian military used chemical weapons on Yemeni royalists sheltering in caves in Yemen as early as June 1963, and it eventually launched around 40 separate chemical weapons attacks in the country.\[2\] Libya, Syria, and Iraq subsequently began chemical weapons programs, Iraq with Egyptian assistance. Saddam Hussein’s regime would eventually use such weapons extensively in the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s.\[3\] Muammar Gaddafi decided to pursue a similar capability in the 1970s and eventually used the chemical weapons developed in Chad. Syria also began developing chemical weapons in the 1970s, and with Egypt’s and, later, North Korea’s help, grew one of the most advanced chemical weapons arsenals in the world.\[4\]

The environment radically changed after the Cold War ended. The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) prohibiting the development and use of these weapons became nearly universal, with 193 State Parties in 1997 (although Syria, Egypt, and Israel did not ratify the CWC due to persistent regional tensions and unresolved arms control concerns). Still, chemical weapons use halted in the region for 25 years—until it reemerged in Syria under Assad. With the Syrian regime’s use of chemical weapons and rising global competition breaking the consensus around shared norms like the CWC, the circumstances may once again be ripe for renewed chemical weapons proliferation and usage in the Middle East and beyond.

To evaluate this prospect, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) Middle East Program undertook an investigation to assess the potential return of chemical weapons threats to the Middle East and what the United States could do about it. The project was supported by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), but the findings should in no way be interpreted to reflect the views of DTRA, the U.S. Department of Defense, or the U.S. government.

#### **Methodology**

The project’s methodology is based on desk research, 43 interviews, and a tabletop exercise (TTX). CSIS interviewed current and former U.S. and allied government officials, Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and International Criminal Court (ICC) officials, chemical weapons and arms control experts, prosecutors and investigators, survivors, and Syrian regime defectors. The interviews and the TTX assessed the potential for a second wave of chemical weapons proliferation in the Middle East and identified ways that the United States could curb the threat.

The TTX evaluated potential chemical weapons users’ calculations when deciding whether and what kind of chemical weapons to use and the U.S. government’s response to chemical weapons usage in another country. The 23 participants in the TTX included current and former U.S. State Department, Defense Department, National Security Council, military, and OPCW officials, as well as chemical weapons and country experts. The CSIS-created scenarios centered on Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, Egyptian president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, and Iranian supreme leader Ali Khamenei as potential chemical weapons users when faced with a significant challenge to their respective regimes. These governments were chosen to reflect states with different alliances, political systems, and histories with chemical weapons, including as developers, proliferators, users, and victims. In the second part of the TTX, teams predicted what a U.S. response to chemical weapons attacks might be and how it could be improved.

#### **Analysis**

CSIS analysis revealed several alarming trends. First, most experts believe that the taboo against chemical weapons use in the Middle East is in danger and has probably already eroded. Interviews and the TTX both reinforced this point. Experts underscored the utility of these weapons’ psychological impacts, instilling terror even when used without great precision. The sobering reality is that weaponized toxic industrial chemicals (TICs) such as chlorine can have many of the same impacts as agents the CWC specifically bars, such as sarin. Consequently, virtually any actor can wield chemical weapons with chilling effectiveness.

CSIS also found that U.S. allies and adversaries are likely learning from Syria’s use of chemical weapons. The Syrian government’s use of Schedule 1 agents such as sarin provoked swift international condemnation, but it used TICs such as chlorine repeatedly with relative impunity. Syria’s experience, combined with ambiguity in the CWC regarding TICs, riot-control agents (RCAs), and pharmaceutical-based agents (PBAs), could tempt some states to escalate attacks with these substances gradually, testing the limits of international accountability.

In addition, approaches can be blended. Assad demonstrated a successful strategy for using Schedule 1 agents sparingly for internal and external deterrence, interspersed with chlorine gas attacks for more tactical military operations. U.S. adversaries may believe that they could survive economic sanctions and other forms of international condemnation just as the Syrian regime did. Experts with whom CSIS consulted assessed that U.S. partners are likely to believe they could use their political leverage for protection against international retribution.

This latter issue points to a larger concern. A more multipolar world makes deterrence and accountability more challenging, if not impossible. With increased great power competition, the experts that CSIS consulted concluded that it will become easier for chemical weapons users to find an international patron that can protect them from accountability. The TTX and expert interviews underscored other tactics that potential users might employ to evade accountability, such as deflecting blame or disseminating disinformation. The support of powerful allies like Russia and China on the world stage would make such strategies more effective.

> A more multipolar world makes deterrence and accountability more challenging, if not impossible.

Finally, despite the ease of using TICs as weapons, experts assessed that nonstate actors appear to be a lesser threat to the chemical weapons taboo than state actors. Though governments may blame nonstate actors in “false flag” attacks, nonstate actors’ lack of technical expertise and the widescale availability of conventional weapons limit the likelihood of their usage of chemical weapons. The United States and others may also find it easier and more politically palatable to punish nonstate actors.

Experts noted that the United States could work with its allies, the OPCW, and other international bodies, including the UN General Assembly (UNGA) and the UN Secretary-General’s Mechanism for Investigation of Alleged Use of Chemical and Biological Weapons (UNSGM), to reestablish consensus on the chemical weapons taboo and pursue alternative pathways toward accountability (e.g., courts with international jurisdiction, including the ICC). Given U.S. reluctance to use military means to punish chemical weapons users, the TTX and expert interviews highlighted that prevention was key to discouraging chemical weapons use. The United States should enhance intelligence efforts to detect chemical weapons activity. Then, it should discuss alternatives with allies and backchannel robust threats and incentives to deter adversaries from using chemical weapons and inciting a mass casualty event.

**Findings and Recommendations**

**1) Finding:** The taboo against chemical weapons use has been degraded since Syria began using chemical weapons in 2013. As a result, Middle Eastern governments, including U.S. partners and allies, may be willing to use chemical weapons if there is a significant challenge to their regimes.

> Middle Eastern governments, including U.S. partners and allies, may be willing to use chemical weapons if there is a significant challenge to their regimes.

_**1a) Recommendation:**_ The U.S. Department of Defense and the White House, in coordination with high-ranking officials in the Middle East, should further develop a regional security architecture or regional fora similar to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to improve lines of communication and reduce the potential for misunderstanding, surprises, and unplanned escalation. This could allow the United States to prevent some actors, especially partners, from using chemical weapons.

_**1b) Recommendation:**_ The United States should use backchannels to communicate significant threats for using chemical weapons and, potentially, incentives for not using them (e.g., the United States offering to help the Egyptian military quell an insurgency using conventional means). To preempt chemical weapons attacks in this way, the United States will need to develop deeper intelligence capabilities on chemical weapons stockpiles. In Syria, having this capability prior to a major attack gave Washington a window to change Assad’s calculus.

**2) Finding:** Mediating powers and middle powers may be essential in channeling communications during a potential escalation, making incentives and warnings more effective. For example, both Syria and Egypt’s main concern in the near term is the loss of Gulf support. If the United States can win the support of Gulf states to uphold the norm, threats will be more effective.

_**2a) Recommendation:**_ U.S. diplomats and military officials should work with these mediating powers to reestablish red lines on arms control and chemical weapons usage and to deliver messages to potential chemical weapons users during times of increased threat. They could relay the message that there is widespread consensus on the need to pursue accountability if chemical weapons are used.

_**2b) Recommendation:**_ In return for existing defense and diplomatic ties, U.S. diplomats should encourage these states to act as linkages and mediators to deescalate tensions when a neighbor is facing significant challenges.

**3) Finding:** States could likely act with impunity if they eased into chemical weapons use. Learning from the Syria example, actors could test the limits of international outrage and condemnation and gradually raise the threshold of objectionable behavior. For example, they could start using RCAs in lethal ways, and then graduate to using TICs or PBAs. These chemicals, in combination with sporadic usage of Schedule 1 and 2 chemicals, could inspire fear among opposition forces or in communities while limiting an international response due to the ambiguity on their usage in the CWC.

_**3a) Recommendation:**_ U.S. diplomats should work with allies to condemn the Syrian government’s regularized use of chlorine gas and bar further normalization with the Syrian regime. U.S. diplomats in the United Nations should work with other states in UNGA to develop a consensus around prohibited uses for RCAs, TICs, and PBAs.

_**3b) Recommendation:**_ U.S. diplomats in The Hague should work with other member states, the OPCW, and private companies, in tandem with experts at the Chemical and Biological Controls Division, the Office of Chemical and Biological Weapons Affairs, DTRA, and the Australia Group to better regulate the movement, storage, and usage of dual-use chemicals, TICs, RCAs, and PBAs.

**4) Finding:** Chemical weapons users are likely to spread disinformation and impede the collection of evidence to evade accountability. This limits the effectiveness of investigations and encourages usage, gradually deteriorating the CWC.

_**4a) Recommendation:**_ The Department of Defense—including DTRA—should support the development of evidence collection technologies such as “drone sniffers” and lab materials that would make it easier to collect evidence and train trusted organizations or civil society members to gather evidence when needed.

_**4b) Recommendation**_**:** The U.S. State Department’s CBW and DTRA’s Information Resiliency Office should work together to strengthen the credibility of the OPCW, local evidence collectors, and chemical weapons experts. These efforts should focus not only on the gathering of evidence, but also on incorporating the help of communications experts. The U.S. government should also continue to support the OPCW ChemTech Centre.

_**4c) Recommendation:**_ The Department of Defense should continue to seek support for, and even strengthen, DTRA’s Information Resiliency Office to protect the agency from disinformation. These efforts should be expanded to interagency efforts with the State Department and the UN mission to prevent the effectiveness of disinformation directed at other relevant U.S. government entities.

**5) Finding:** Chemical weapons do not stand alone. They are integrated into a broader warfighting toolkit. Governments use chemical weapons in conjunction with other military tactics, such as conventional explosive weapons and sieges, to amplify fear among armed adversaries and civilians alike. U.S. officials may underestimate the motivations for using chemical weapons because they judge the “success” of chemical weapons through direct casualty numbers rather than their broader military—and psychological—effects.

_**5a) Recommendation:**_ DTRA should analyze the secondary effects of chemical weapons usage by collecting evidence and testimony on their usage when used alongside conventional weapons to assess their tactical benefits beyond direct casualty figures. With such information, the United States may better predict why an actor would use them, prevent proliferation and attacks, and strengthen accountability for these secondary uses.

**6) Finding:** Nonstate actors appear to be a lesser threat to the chemical weapons taboo than state actors.

_**6a) Recommendation:**_ Scholars should conduct further research to determine if new delivery mechanisms and the accessibility of certain types of TICs could increase the threat of nonstate actors using chemical weapons.

**7) Finding:** Escalating tensions between the United States and Russia, coupled with fractures in the international community, challenge existing mechanisms for chemical weapons control and accountability.

_**7a) Recommendation:**_ To reverse the normalization of chemical weapons usage and the breakdown of other norms, U.S. diplomats should launch a preemptive and aggressive multilateral campaign to hold chemical weapons users to account. For this multilateral approach to be effective, the United States needs to work more closely with members of the Global South and with China to ensure that such measures (e.g., investigations, sanctions, asset freezes, travel bans, etc.) are effective.

> To reverse the normalization of chemical weapons usage and the breakdown of other norms, U.S. diplomats should launch a preemptive and aggressive multilateral campaign to hold chemical weapons users to account.

_**7b) Recommendation:**_ To widen support of the CWC and accountability efforts, DTRA should assess the strategic reasons that actors—including adversaries such as China and allies and partners such as Egypt or India—would want to prevent the proliferation and usage of chemical weapons.

_**7c) Recommendation:**_ The United States and its allies and partners should consider supporting an entity separate from the OPCW and UNSC that would attribute violations and hold violators criminally liable. They should ensure that any such entity embraces a diverse membership. The Working Group to Advance Proposals for International Criminal Accountability for Chemical Weapons Use established in September 2024 and composed of 12 states from around the world is one step toward such an effort.

_**7d) Recommendation:**_ The Department of Justice, the United States Ambassador-at-Large for Global Criminal Justice, and diplomats with the OPCW and partners should enhance measures within and outside of the OPCW that would strengthen CWC prohibitions and ensure that those responsible for crimes involving chemical weapons will be brought to justice. For example, INTERPOL Washington, the U.S. National Central Bureau, should support specialized training projects for law enforcement officers, prosecutors, and judges. The United States and allies should also further develop the capacity of the OPCW’s Investigation and Identification Team to interface with national and international legal systems to prosecute those that have used chemical weapons.

_**7e) Recommendation:**_ U.S. diplomats at the UN mission and partners should explore avenues for coalition-building around accountability and investigations within the United Nations. The United States should build coalitions with nonpermanent UNSC members and UNGA to enhance and broaden support for accountability for noncompliance with the CWC. The UNGA-created International, Impartial, and Independent Mechanism (IIIM) to assist in the investigation and prosecution of persons responsible for the most serious crimes committed since March 2011 is a good example of how effective such efforts can be. The IIIM helps to preserve evidence that states with universal jurisdiction could use for prosecution. The United States should also work to strengthen the UN Secretary-General’s Mechanism for Investigation of Alleged Use of Chemical and Biological Weapons (UNSGM) to investigate chemical weapons uses when CWC procedures do not apply or are not invoked by any State Party.

_**7f) Recommendation:**_ U.S. diplomats should consider focusing on the elimination of chemical weapons in the Middle East as the first step in a broader effort to uphold the Conference on the Establishment of a Middle East Zone Free of Nuclear Weapons and Other Weapons of Mass Destruction.

=================================================================================

The strong statement comes as the U.S. tries to rally the global community.

ByABC News

January 23, 2018, 2:24 PM

&#151; -- In the aftermath of another "apparent chlorine gas attack" by the regime of Syrian [President Bashar al-Assad](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/president-bashar-al-assad.htm)
, Secretary of State [Rex Tillerson](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/business/CEOs/rex-tillerson.htm)
 blasted the Assad regime for its "crimes against humanity" but also laid some of the blame on Russia.

"Whoever conducted the attacks, Russia ultimately bears responsibility for the victims in east Ghouta and countless other Syrians targeted with [chemical weapons](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/syrian-chemical-weapons.htm)
 since Russia became involved in [Syria](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/syrian-protests.htm)
," Tillerson said in Paris at the launch of a new international group to pressure Assad and Russia.

The strong statement comes as the U.S. tries to rally the international community and assert a leadership role in Syria after seven years of war and in the face of an increasingly strong Assad regime.

As ABC News reported Monday, Tillerson highlighted the latest reported chemical weapons attack that affected more than 20 civilians -- most of them children, he said. The attack hit east Ghouta, an enclave of rebel support in the Damascus suburbs, a part of the country that Assad has long dominated. East Ghouta has been under siege by the regime for years now, but despite a cease-fire agreement over the summer, the regime has starved and bombed the area for the past few months. In recent weeks, that bombing campaign escalated, according to monitoring groups.

"The recent attacks in east Ghouta are a serious concern that Bashar al-Assad's Syrian regime may be continuing its use of chemical weapons against its own people," Tillerson said. "Since April 2014, there has been mounting evidence that Syria continues to illicit possess chemical weapons and use them against its own people."

But it was Russia that Tillerson took to task, challenging the role the country plays by providing support and troops to Assad -- who, after initial defeats, now controls half of the country's population and territory.

"Russia's failure to resolve the chemical weapons issue in Syria calls into question its relevance to the resolution to the overall crisis," Tillerson said.

In particular, Tillerson said Russia had failed to live up to its commitments under the 2013 deal with the Obama administration to eliminate all of Syria's chemical weapons and other international legal obligations: "There is simply no denying that Russia, by shielding its Syrian ally, has breached its commitments to the United States as a framework guarantor. It has betrayed the Chemical Weapons Convention and U.N. [Security Council](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/us/security-council.htm)
 Resolution 2218," he said.

Russia has intervened in Syria on Assad's behalf since 2015, but in August 2013 it helped broker an agreement with President Barack Obama to remove Syria's chemical weapons stockpile. That agreement came on the heels of Obama contemplating airstrikes on Syrian targets after the regime killed at least 1,400 people, including 426 children, in a chemical weapons attack, also in the Damascus suburbs, according to a U.S. government report at the time. Ultimately, Obama punted to Congress, and the U.S. never took any action.

The Trump administration challenged Syria's use of chemical weapons once before -- with a series of airstrikes last April on a Syrian air base after the regime killed dozens in a town called Khan Shaykhun.

The U.S. "will pursue all available avenues for accountability," according to Haley's office, including through the U.N. Security Council, the [Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/chemical-weapons-convention.htm)
 and the International Partnership Against Impunity for the Use of Chemical Weapons -- the new international group Tillerson helped launch today. The 29-nation organization will collect, share and publicize information about chemical attack perpetrators, including details about sanctions.

For his part, Tillerson called on Russia to "at a bare minimum ... stop vetoing and at least abstain from future Security Council votes on this issue."

Russia has twice vetoed resolutions for an investigative body to examine who is responsible for chemical weapons attacks in Syria, and the Security Council was set to meet again on Syria on Tuesday afternoon.

"This initiative puts those who ordered and carried out chemical weapons attacks on notice. You will face a day of reckoning for your crimes against humanity and your victims will see justice done," Tillerson said in conclusion. "The people of east Ghouta are watching, and the rest of the world is watching as well."

But in a major policy address on Syria last week, Tillerson sounded a more optimistic tone on Russia and the "meaningful role" it plays in Syria -- and even praised Russia for its cooperation with the U.S. and [Jordan](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/jordan-jordanian.htm)
 on one de-escalation zone south of Damascus, despite ongoing Assad offensives elsewhere.

"That's why we're disappointed with the foreign minister's comments," Under Secretary of State Steve Goldstein told ABC News Monday, a reference to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accusing the U.S. of fomenting unrest and instability in Syria and even supporting al Qaeda-linked militants. "The secretary is very unhappy that Russia has not stepped up to the plate as we would expect them to."

Still, with offensives against the last rebel stronghold, Idlib province, and the relentless bombing of east Ghouta, Assad and his allies, including Russia and Iran, seem to be marching onward, again and again deploying brutal tactics.

"No party in the Syrian conflict is capable of victory or stabilizing the country via military means alone," Tillerson warned, despite the regime's offensives.

A Palestinian baby girl, saved from the womb of her mother Sabreen Al-Sakani, who was killed in an Israeli strike along with her husband Shukri Jouda and her daughter Malak, lies in an incubator at the Emirati hospital in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, April 21.

Mohammed Salem/Reuters

RAFAH, Gaza Strip — There had been a glimmer of hope in Rafah this past weekend, when medics were able to rescue a baby girl from her mother's womb after airstrikes Saturday night killed her entire family.

Her mother was dead by the time she was brought to the field hospital, but doctors were able to operate on her outside its main structure quickly, performing an emergency cesarean section to pull her baby out.

The mother, Sabreen al-Sakani, had been 30 weeks pregnant. **Reuters TV/via REUTERS** ****hide caption****

### The sole survivor of her family

The baby's mother, her father Shukri Jouda, and toddler sister Malak — Arabic for angel — were also killed in the Israeli airstrike that hit the family's home in Rafah, according to information from the hospital morgue and extended family.

The day after the strike that killed the family, the baby's [uncle, Rami al-Sheikh, told cameras](https://news.sky.com/story/israel-hamas-war-sabreen-jouda-the-baby-girl-saved-from-dead-mothers-womb-in-gaza-dies-13123248#:~:text=Sabreen%20Jouda%20was%20born%20prematurely,care%20unit%20at%20another%20hospital.)
 he was ready to care for her. More than 34,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war since then, according to Gaza health officials.

Hisham al-Sayed's mother holds up a photograph of her son in April 2016

**Palestinian militant group Hamas has released a video appearing to show an Israeli citizen being held captive in the Gaza Strip.**

The clip appears to show Hisham al-Sayed lying in a bed looking dazed and wearing an oxygen mask - the first sighting of him since 2015.

Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said releasing a video of a sick man was "reprehensible and desperate."

The BBC has not been able to independently verify the footage.

Hamas alleges that Mr al-Sayed is an Israeli soldier, but both the Israeli government and his family say he is a civilian with mental health problems.

The charity Human Rights Watch, which has criticised Mr al-Sayed's "unlawful detention" in the past, says he was last seen walking into the Gaza Strip in April 2015 for unknown reasons, having made similar attempts to cross the frontier in the past.

In the video released by Hamas the 34-year-old, who is a member of Israel's Bedouin Arab minority, could be seen lying attached to a ventilator beside what appeared to be his Israeli-issued ID card.

A television monitor also in the room showed news footage from an economic conference in Qatar earlier this month.

No further details were given by the Palestinian militant group about the detainee's condition other than a reference on Monday to his health having deteriorated.

Israel says he is one of two citizens, the second being Avera Mengistu, currently being held captive by Hamas in violation of international law.

Both are believed to have crossed willingly into the Gaza Strip despite Israel banning its citizens from entering the Palestinian enclave.

There was some suggestion that the video's release was an attempt by Hamas to pressure Israel into resuming prisoner swap negotiations.

The two sides have engaged in prisoner swaps in the past, most notably in 2011 when abducted Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit was released in exchange for more than 1,000 Palestinians held in Israeli jails.

A wounded Palestinian girl is brought into Nasser hospital after Israeli strikes on Khan Younis in December 2023 (Ibraheem Abu Mustafa/Reuters)

[](#main-content)

By [MEE staff](/users/mee-staff "View user profile.")

Published date: 24 April 2025 11:37 BST | Last update: 4 months ago

It is 18 months since [Israel](https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/israel)
 declared [war on Gaza](https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/israel-war-gaza)
, following the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel in October 2023, which killed more than 1,100 people.

At the time of writing, more than 51,000 Palestinians have been killed and more than 100,000 injured from a pre-war population of 2.2 million. And on 13 April, Israel bombed [al-Ahli al-Arabi Baptist Hospital](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israel-bombs-one-last-functioning-hospitals-gaza)
, Gaza’s last fully functioning hospital.

More than 90 percent of health facilities in Gaza sustained some damage throughout 2024.

Witnesses to the attack on the al-Ahli al-Arabi Baptist Hospital said the Israeli military gave staff and patients, some of who were in intensive care, 18 minutes to leave.

![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)A doctor from the Red Crescent told MEE that medical staff now had to send displaced patients to other hospitals which themselves had limited care.

"All the hospitals are overcrowded and are unprepared for providing full medical services,” he said. Israel has also blockaded supplies of aid and other essentials into [Gaza since 2 March](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israel-blocks-all-aid-entering-gaza-following-end-first-phase-ceasefire)
.

The Palestinian dead have come from all age groups: women, children and the elderly account for 56 percent of those killed.

That high level of fatalities has also slashed the average life expectancy of Palestinians, according to a [study in The Lancet](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)02810-1/abstract)
.

For Palestinian men, the drop in average life expectancy has been 51.6 percent to 40.5 years during the first 12 months of the war - that’s a loss of 34.9 years of life. 

For Palestinian women, it has been a cut of 38.6 percent to an average life expectancy of 47.5 years - a loss of 29.9 years. Before the war, agriculture, according to the [UN Food and Agriculture Organisation](https://www.fao.org/newsroom/detail/FAO-gaza-emergency-relief-food-production/en)
, accounted for “approximately 10 percent of Gaza’s economy, with more than 560,000 people relying entirely or partially on cropping, herding, or fishing for their livelihoods”.

More importantly, agriculture allowed Palestinians to feed themselves. 

That stopped with the war, as [fishing fleets](https://acrobat.adobe.com/id/urn:aaid:sc:EU:aff5befe-3f73-48d4-af91-201f2fcc4bf1)

 and other [necessities for](https://openknowledge.fao.org/items/09e7c2a2-6a31-4ac4-88c9-deb023f14a10)
 food production were devastated by Israeli attacks.

![Food production losses in Gaza](/sites/default/files/styles/article_page/public/Gaza%20food%20production%20graphic.jpg.webp?itok=-Hxm_-tM)

The scarcity of food has been reflected in high prices: for example, in [Deir al-Balah Governorate](https://www.solidarites.org/en/?s=gaza)
 in central Gaza, food prices soared between October 2023 and December 2024, including a kilogram of flour (1,058 by percent), tomatoes (956 percent), cucumbers (752 percent), lentils (360 percent) and rice (142 percent) among others.

In April 2025, Gaza’s [bakery owners’ association](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/all-bakeries-forced-close-gaza-due-lack-flour-and-fuel)
, announced that they had all shut due to a lack of flour and fuel because of Israel’s blockade.

Likewise, livestock has been hit: [milk production](https://www.thenationalnews.com/mena/palestine-israel/2024/02/01/gaza-fresh-milk-supply/)
, for example, has almost halted on occasion, while meat is hard to come by.

![Livestock losses in Gaza](/sites/default/files/styles/article_page/public/Gaza-livestock-graphic.jpg.webp?itok=4F0cszaN)

Farmer Faraj Jarudat, a farmer from northern Gaza, [told The Guardian in November 2024](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/21/gaza-food-production-decimated-70-per-cent-farmland-hit)
 that he used to own three cows and 60 sheep. “There is not a single one left.”

The farm and his home, he was told by friends and former neighbours, had been bulldozed by Israeli forces.

### Malnutrition in Gaza

The lack of food that has been a constant during Israel’s war on Gaza has brought with it malnutrition.

In April 2024, Oxfam reported that Palestinians in northern Gaza were surviving on an average of 245 calories per day, or [less than one can of fava beans](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/palestinians-northern-gaza-living-less-can-beans-day-report-says)
. My face is pale and I’ve lost a lot of weight.”

The Palestinian population has often been driven to extreme measures, such as [eating grass](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/war-gaza-palestinians-are-being-forced-eat-grass-heres-what-it-does-your-body)
, which is indigestible for humans, causes diarrhoea and vomiting, and has negligible nutritional value. On other occasions, [animal fodder](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/war-gaza-palestinians-forced-mix-animal-fodder-flour-make-bread)
 has been used to make bread.

Many NGOs, charities, and other agencies use the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification or [IPC](https://www.ipcinfo.org/)

In February 2025, it was estimated that at least 60,000 children in Gaza will need treatment for [acute malnutrition](https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/reported-impact-snapshot-gaza-strip-4-february-2025-1500)
 in the coming year.

There have already been instances of child fatalities, including [Azzam al-Shaer](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/war-on-gaza-palestinian-child-dies-malnutrition-gaza-hunger-crisis-rages)
, who died in June 2024; and [Yazan al-Kafarna](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/war-gaza-palestinian-child-dies-hunger-and-malnutrition-gaza)
, who died in March 2024.

Yazan was born with cerebral palsy, meaning he had to follow a special diet and take supplements. Human waste is one of the many forms of pollution in Gaza, attracting mosquitoes that in turn can spread disease.

Homeless Palestinians, who usually live in tents, have little protection against insect bites and their serious effects.

In May 2024, [Omar Nasser described to MEE](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/war-gaza-overflowing-waste-threatens-health-crisis-hepatitis-spread)
 how his daughter Gada, then aged nine, had contracted hepatitis A, a liver infection that is transmitted through solid human waste and can be caught from coming into contact with unclean water or eating food handled by an infected person.

Nasser took his daughter to hospital, where a doctor prescribed some medications and a nutritional diet, which Nasser could not provide as he is unemployed.

"The doctor said she must not eat canned food, but it's the only food we get from the aid organisations," he said. “I’ve had to ask people for food to provide for my daughter.”

United States vetoes Gaza ceasefire resolution at Security Council
==================================================================

20 November 2024 [Peace and Security](/en/news/topic/peace-and-security)

The United States on Wednesday vetoed a UN Security Council draft resolution that demanded an immediate and unconditional ceasefire in the Gaza Strip.

Despite having secured 14 votes in favour, the draft resolution put forward by the 10 elected members of the [Security Council](https://main.un.org/securitycouncil/)
 (E10), failed to pass owing to the negative vote by a permanent member, the US.

The text also reiterated the Council’s demand for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages.

For a resolution to be adopted, it must secure at least nine votes in favour, and no negative votes – or vetoes – by any of the five permanent members.

Under the [UN Charter](http://www.un.org/en/charter-united-nations/index.html)
, the Security Council has the primary responsibility to uphold international peace and security.

The US representative Ambassador Robert Wood said in his statement that the US could not support an unconditional ceasefire unless it was tied to releasing the hostages being held in Gaza by Hamas and other militants. 

Had the draft resolution been adopted, it would have demanded immediate access for civilians in the Gaza Strip to basic services.

It would have rejected “any effort to starve Palestinians” – the threat of famine grows in the north as the Israeli siege there continues – while also demanding the facilitation of full, rapid, safe and unhindered entry of aid at scale to and throughout the Strip and its delivery to all those in need.

The text also demanded that the parties “fully, unconditionally, and without delay” implement all the provisions of Security Council resolution 2735 (2024).

This includes the release of hostages, the exchange of Palestinian prisoners, the return of the remains of hostages who have been killed, the return of Palestinian civilians to their homes and neighbourhoods in all areas of Gaza – including in the north – and a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.

The draft further underscored the role of the UN relief agency for Palestine refugees ([UNRWA](https://www.unrwa.org/)
) as the backbone of the humanitarian response in Gaza.

It called on all parties to enable UNRWA to carry out its mandate as adopted by the General Assembly, with full respect for the humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality, and independence.

It also urged respect for international humanitarian law, including the protection of UN and humanitarian facilities, while welcoming the Secretary-General’s and UNRWA’s commitment to fully implement the recommendations of an independent review of the agency led by former French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna.

#### Subscribe to receive SCR publications The frustrations of these members are apparently deepened by the possibility of the US still using its veto tomorrow.

It seems that during the 16 October [closed consultations](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2024/10/the-middle-east-including-the-palestinian-question-briefing-and-consultations-on-the-situation-in-northern-gaza.php)
 on “The situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian question”, Algeria asked Guyana, as the E10 coordinator for the month of October, to start consultations on a new Security Council product on the war in Gaza. (For background on the situation in Gaza, see the [brief](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/monthly-forecast/2024-11/the-middle-east-including-the-palestinian-question-18.php)
 on “The Middle East, including the Palestinian Question” in our November 2024 _Monthly Forecast_ and our 11 November _What’s in Blue_ [story](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2024/11/briefing-on-risk-of-famine-in-northern-gaza.php)
.)

_Negotiations on the Draft Resolution_

Negotiations on the draft resolution were difficult, with several Council members apparently disappointed with the low level of ambition of the draft text in blue following various compromises made in an attempt to secure an abstention from the US, Israel’s key ally at the Security Council. Similarly to the press statement, the draft text in blue does not include language “rejecting” actions undermining UNRWA’s mandate, but underscores that UNRWA “remains the backbone” of the humanitarian response in Gaza, calls on all parties to enable UNRWA to carry out its mandate, and welcomes the Secretary-General’s and UNRWA’s commitment to implement the recommendations of an independent review which evaluated UNRWA’s adherence to neutrality principles.

At the same time, a request from the US for language establishing a standing mechanism to review allegations raised by Israel regarding UNRWA employees being affiliated with Hamas was not included in the draft resolution. This position is close to the long-held US stance that the two calls should be linked in line with the US position in the indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas. This revision was apparently a key factor for Japan in joining the other elected members in sponsoring the draft resolution.

However, the US apparently still found that this formulation, which had been used to overcome similar differences during the [negotiations](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2024/03/the-middle-east-including-the-palestinian-question-yesterdays-adoption-and-todays-briefing-and-consultations.php)
 on resolution 2728, fell short of its request for an explicit conditional link between the two demands, such as the one featured in resolution 2735. At the time of writing, it was unclear whether the US will accept this compromise and the draft in blue remains unchanged.

Language on persons detained by the parties still features virtually unchanged in the draft in blue, but as a stand-alone paragraph, which apparently reflects a US request not to suggest “an equivalence” between the hostages taken in Israel held captive by Palestinian armed groups and Palestinians prisoners detained by Israel by addressing them in the same paragraph.

Another major issue of contention was language in the early drafts of the resolution determining—in line with [Article 39](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/un-charter/chapter-7)
 of the UN Charter—that the situation in the Gaza Strip and the regional escalation constitute a threat to international peace and security. It seems, however, that the US still sought the deletion of this language, a request that was not reflected in the draft in blue.

It appears that the US also objected to language recalling the provisional orders of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in South Africa’s [case](https://www.icj-cij.org/case/192)
 against Israel on the Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide in the Gaza Strip. It also rejects “any effort to starve Palestinians” and demands immediate access to basic services and humanitarian assistance for civilians in Gaza, and the facilitation of entry of humanitarian assistance at scale and its delivery, including to “civilians in besieged north Gaza”.

_Background_

This will be the twelfth time the Security Council votes on a draft resolution on the war in Gaza."

Content: "could not support the unconditional ceasefire that failed to release the hostages.  “We heard that some desired the US veto rather than a consensus product,” he observed, emphasizing that his Government has done more than any other country to improve the humanitarian conditions in Gaza.

“The draft resolution this Council failed to adopt today sought only to break its deafening silence,” stressed Algeria’s delegate, noting that the text, although far from ideal, represented a “bare minimum that should have united us”.  Instead, today’s message to Israel is that “you may continue your genocide” and “in this Chamber, you enjoy immunity”, he said, adding that the message to Palestinians is also clear:  “While the overwhelming majority of the world stands in solidarity with your plight, tragically, others remain indifferent to your suffering.”

The representative of the Russian Federation stated:  “We will not allow the United States to muzzle the voice of the Council and continue emboldening further merciless operations by Israel”, calling Washington, D.C.’s “cold and cynical” opposition to saving lives — “inhumane”.  “You today have definitively shown that you are fully responsible for the death of tens of thousands of innocent civilians,” he continued, observing that, if adopted, the resolution would have sent a clear signal to the parties to end violence and move to a diplomatic settlement.

In the same vein, China’s delegate said that the United States’ long use of the veto has dashed the hope of people of Gaza of survival.  Noting that “so-called” diplomatic negotiations — conducted by the United States — have seen no progress, he observed that its continued weapons supply has become a decisive factor in the war lasting so long.  “Insistence on setting a precondition to ceasefire is tantamount to giving a green light to continuing war”, he said, stating that Israel’s military operation has long exceeded the scope of rescuing hostages.

Meanwhile, the representative of Ecuador pointed out that, for the second time in 2024, the 10 elected Council members “accepted the challenge” of drafting a text that would be acceptable to all the organ’s members and would allow it to fulfil its responsibilities “in the face of a pressing situation”.  “Fourteen votes in favour are a clear indication that the draft resolution put forward was ‘timely and appropriate’”, he stated. Adding to that France’s delegate stated that “international humanitarian law is being trampled underfoot”.

“There is an entire generation of children in Gaza we are failing,” lamented Slovenia’s delegate, joined by the representatives of the Republic of Korea and Malta in regretting the non-adoption of the text.  Japan’s representative added that without collective action, “children in Gaza — the future of Gaza — will continue to pay the high price of this conflict”. For his part, Sierra Leone’s delegate emphasized that, if adopted, the text would have allowed the Council to “unite its strength to save humanity from destruction”.

Offering a different perspective, the speaker for Switzerland underscored that Israel, as an occupying Power, has a duty to ensure that the basic needs in the occupied Palestinian territories are met.  “Israel must take urgent action to alleviate this crisis,” stressed the United Kingdom’s delegate, Council President for November, speaking in her national capacity. Voicing regret that consensus was not reached, she affirmed her country’s unwavering commitment to realize the vision of the text.

However, the representative of Israel said that today’s resolution was not a path to peace — “it was a road map to more terror, more suffering and more bloodshed”. “Many of you attempted to pass this injustice,” he added, thanking the United States for using its veto and refusing to abandon the hostages and their families.  Had the text passed, the Council would have sent a message to the world that terrorists can act with impunity and would have “validated their \[Hamas\] strategy of using human shields, targeting civilians and tormenting hostages in their terror dungeons”.

Further, “it would have set a horrifying precedent that terrorism pays”, he said — “that violence is met not with condemnation, but with concessions”.  The Council has already adopted four resolutions demanding the release of hostages, and Hamas has ignored them all.  While the loss of civilian life in Gaza is a tragedy, he stressed that “it is a tragedy authored by Hamas”.  He concluded:  “If Hamas were to release the hostages and surrender their weapons, not one more shot would need to be fired; but, until that day comes, Israel will do whatever it takes to protect its people and bring our loved ones home.”

“The world should not grow accustomed to the death of Palestinians,” stressed the observer of the State of Palestine, adding:  “Maybe — for some — we have the wrong nationality, the wrong faith, the wrong skin colour; but we are humans, and we should be treated as such.”  Although a ceasefire “doesn’t resolve everything, but it is the first step to resolving anything”, he said.  Questioning whether international law applies differently to Israel than to the rest of the world, he asked:  “What the hell does Israel need to do more for this Council to act under Chapter VII?”  The world is witnessing an attempt to annihilate a nation, and yet the very tools designed to respond to such a situation are not being used. 

“This self-inflicted powerlessness has to stop,” he urged.  The message that would have been sent by today’s resolution — trying to save lives — was not a dangerous one; rather, its veto is a dangerous message to Israel that it can continue executing its plans.  “And the messages we send do matter, and that is the wrong message at the worst possible time,” he stressed.  Adding that, one day, people will examine the records of these meetings and wonder how a genocide known to the whole world was able to continue for so long, he stated:  “It is because we are allowed to speak about the rules, but not to enforce them.”

Security Council Fails to Adopt Resolution Demanding Immediate Ceasefire in Gaza, as United States Casts Negative Vote
======================================================================================================================

The Security Council today failed to adopt a text, put forward by its 10 elected members, that called for an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Gaza and demanded the release of all hostages, on account of a negative vote cast by a permanent member.

Introducing the draft resolution, the representative of Guyana said the text was prompted by the Council’s deep concern over the catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza and a need for an urgent response.  She observed that the release of hostages is one of the most important provisions of the text.  Spotlighting broad consensus, she noted that, while several divergent positions have found a balance in the text, the dominant concern has been to provide a legally binding obligation to end the hostilities.

Although the vote that followed garnered support for the resolution from 14 Council members, the text was not adopted due to a veto cast by the United States.

If adopted, the resolution would have demanded Gaza’s civilian population be given access to basic services, while it would have rejected any effort to starve Palestinians and would have demanded humanitarian assistance at scale.  Further, it would have also demanded the release of hostages, the exchange of Palestinian prisoners and the return of Palestinian civilians to all areas in Gaza, as it would have also underscored that the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) remains a backbone of humanitarian response.

However, the representative of the United States said that “this resolution would have sent a dangerous message to Hamas:  there is no need to come back to the negotiating table”, recalling that the group has rejected “deal after deal after deal”.  More so, Washington, D.C. Not an official record.

 avoiding the potential constraint on militia service that it can only be used "to execute the laws of the Union, suppress insurrections and repel invasions."

Able-bodied men between the ages of 17 and 45 not in the National Guard are defined in the Militia Act, and under the laws of some states, as the [unorganized militia](/wiki/Militia_(United_States)#Unorganized_militia "Militia (United States)")

In 1917, the administration of [President](/wiki/President_of_the_United_States "President of the United States")
 [Woodrow Wilson](/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson "Woodrow Wilson")
 decided to rely primarily on conscription, rather than voluntary enlistment, to raise military manpower for [World War I](/wiki/World_War_I "World War I")
 when only 73,000 volunteers enlisted out of the initial 1 million target in the first six weeks of the war.[\[17\]](#cite_note-17)
 One ascribed motivation was to thwart former president [Theodore Roosevelt](/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt "Theodore Roosevelt")
, who proposed raising a volunteer division, which would have upstaged Wilson. However, there is no evidence that Roosevelt had enough support to carry out that plan, and because Wilson had just started his second term, the former President's prospects for substantial political gain seemed dubious.\[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")\

The [Selective Service Act of 1917](/wiki/Selective_Service_Act_of_1917 "Selective Service Act of 1917")
 was carefully drawn to remedy the defects in the Civil War system and—by allowing exemptions for dependency, essential occupations, and religious scruples—to place each man in his proper niche in a national war effort.[\[18\]](#cite_note-18)
 The act established a "liability for military service of all male citizens"; authorized a selective draft of all those between 21 and 31 years of age (later from 18 to 45); and prohibited all forms of bounties, substitutions, or purchase of exemptions. Baker")

 Many of these sentences were commuted after the war's end.

In 1917, a number of radicals and [anarchists](/wiki/Anarchists "Anarchists")
, including [Emma Goldman](/wiki/Emma_Goldman "Emma Goldman")
, tried to challenge the new draft law in federal court, arguing that it was a direct violation of the [Thirteenth Amendment](/wiki/Thirteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution "Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution")
's prohibition against [slavery and involuntary servitude](/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States "Slavery in the United States")
. Congress further tweaked this act in 1950 although the post–World War II surplus of military manpower left little need for draft calls until [President Truman's](/wiki/Harry_S._Truman "Harry S. During the active combat phase, the possibility of avoiding combat by selecting their service and military specialty led as many as four out of 11 eligible men to enlist.[\[53\]](#cite_note-Useem-53)
[\[54\]](#cite_note-54)
 The military relied upon draft-induced volunteerism to meet its quotas, especially for the Army, which accounted for nearly 95% of all inductees during the Vietnam War era. If drafted, they would only serve for two years, but would have no choice over their military occupational specialty.[\[68\]](#cite_note-68)

Of the nearly 16 million men not engaged in active military service, 96% were exempted (typically because of jobs including other military service), deferred (usually for educational reasons), or disqualified (usually for physical and mental deficiencies but also for criminal records including draft violations).[\[29\]](#cite_note-autogenerated2-29)
 The requirements for obtaining and maintaining an educational deferment changed several times in the late 1960s. Gates initially opposed the all-volunteer army idea but changed his mind during the course of the 15-member commission's work.[\[73\]](#cite_note-aitken-73)
 The Gates Commission issued its report in February 1970, describing how adequate military strength could be maintained without having conscription.[\[71\]](#cite_note-evans-71)
[\[76\]](#cite_note-griffith-76)
 The existing draft law was expiring at the end of June 1971, but the Department of Defense and Nixon administration decided the draft needed to continue for at least some time.[\[76\]](#cite_note-griffith-76)
 In February 1971, the administration requested Congress to extend the draft for two years, to June 1973.[\[77\]](#cite_note-nyt020371-77)
[\[78\]](#cite_note-black-78)

Senatorial opponents of the war wanted to reduce this to a one-year extension, eliminate the draft altogether, or tie the draft renewal to a timetable for troop withdrawal from Vietnam;[\[79\]](#cite_note-nyt060571-79)
 Senator [Mike Gravel](/wiki/Mike_Gravel "Mike Gravel")
 of [Alaska](/wiki/Alaska "Alaska")
 took the most forceful approach, trying to [filibuster](/wiki/Filibuster "Filibuster")
 the draft renewal legislation, shut conscription down, and directly force an end to the war.[\[80\]](#cite_note-80)
 Senators supporting Nixon's war efforts supported the bill even though some had qualms about ending the draft.[\[78\]](#cite_note-black-78)
 After a prolonged battle in the Senate, a September 1971 [cloture](/wiki/Cloture "Cloture")
 was achieved over the filibuster, and the draft renewal bill was approved.[\[81\]](#cite_note-nyt092271-81)
 Meanwhile, military pay was increased as an incentive to attract volunteers, and television advertising for the U.S. The Supreme Court upheld the act, stating that Congress's "decision to exempt women was not the accidental byproduct of a traditional way of thinking about women", that "since women are excluded from combat service by statute or military policy, men and women are simply not similarly situated for purposes of a draft or registration for a draft, and Congress' decision to authorize the registration of only men therefore does not violate the Due Process Clause", and that "the argument for registering women was based on considerations of equity, but Congress was entitled, in the exercise of its constitutional powers, to focus on the question of military need, rather than 'equity.'"[\[112\]](#cite_note-112)

The _Rostker v. Though the conclusion of the meeting memo did not call for a reinstatement of the draft, it did suggest Selective Service Act modifications to include registration by women and self-reporting of critical skills that could serve to meet military, homeland-defense, and humanitarian needs.[\[133\]](#cite_note-133)
 This hinted at more targeted draft options being considered, perhaps like that of the "Doctor Draft" that began in the 1950s to provide nearly 66% of the medical professionals who served in the Army in Korea.[\[134\]](#cite_note-134)
 Once created, this manpower tool continued to be used through 1972."

Conscription — a practice most Americans [believe should be](https://news.gallup.com/poll/28642/vast-majority-americans-opposed-reinstituting-military-draft.aspx)
 relegated to the dustbin of history — has returned as an uncomfortable topic of conversation among U.S. [allies](https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-conscription-boris-pistorius-military-service-ukraine-war-bundeswehr/)
 and [adversaries](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russias-putin-signs-decree-spring-military-conscription-2024-03-31/)
 alike. This has generated [concern](https://theconversation.com/us-kicks-off-debate-on-conscription-as-other-nato-members-introduce-drafts-232458)
 and even [conspiracy theories](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2024/06/18/men-draft-selective-service-fact-check/74124846007/)
 among American voters. [France](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-04-05/ukraine-conscription-military-service-panic-isn-t-what-europe-needs?embedded-checkout=true)
, which ended conscription in 1996, and [Germany](https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-conscription-boris-pistorius-military-service-ukraine-war-bundeswehr/)
, which ended conscription in 2011, have recently begun political debates about the potential for future conscription. What would that look like?

A recent proposal to [automate](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2024/05/23/lawmakers-move-to-automate-selective-service-registration-for-all-men/)
 Selective Service System registration for men on their 18th birthdays coupled with debate that the current all-male registration should be [expanded](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/4730560-senate-democrats-require-women-draft/)
 to include all Americans has generated [public rumors](https://thedispatch.com/article/mandatory-registration-for-the-draft-isnt-new-contrary-to-social-media-posts/)
 that the nation is on a wartime footing. The all-volunteer force provides a smaller but [more professionalized](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3316678/all-volunteer-force-proves-successful-for-us-military/)
 force than its predecessor, increasing the standards of those who serve across [metrics](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB9195.html)
 including mental aptitude, physical strength, training, and unit cohesion.

Yet just because the United States transitioned to volunteers does not mean that the nation would never need to call upon a draft in the future. Over the course of the conflict, more than [19 million men](https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/unfit-for-service-physical-fitness-and-civic-obligation-in-world-war-ii.htm#:~:text=Over%2520the%2520course%2520of%2520World,disqualified%2520people%2520from%2520military%2520service.)
 were drafted.

Americans tend to look at conscription during the world wars through the lens of nostalgia, with the perception that these conflicts were more pure expressions of good versus evil than in recent conflicts. In World War I, [15 percent](https://books.google.com/books/about/To_Raise_an_Army.html?id=n3veAAAAMAAJ)
 of men refused to register with Selective Service and a further 12 percent of those drafted deserted the military after induction. When the demand for and deployment of conscripts increased as the United States entrenched itself in Vietnam, resistance to the draft grew rapidly.

In the years since the transition to the all-volunteer force, any [discussion](https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna20219330)
 of [reintroducing](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2011/10/05/chapter-5-the-public-and-the-military/)
 conscription has generated fear of returning to the [Vietnam](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/04/us-military-draft-iran-selective-service-system)
\-era [draft](https://www.newsweek.com/biden-military-draft-rumors-swirl-after-iran-attacks-1865063)
. At the same time, some commentators have recommended conscription as a [solution](https://www.yahoo.com/news/military-recruitment-shortfall-us-bring-162655292.html?guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAA7JeTY-8r59u5hTXfOuGskSzzpIFddCzifP3prJZkmJmxxTaN9HnyaxjuQGrEGmIGQGXqXu5QctMJlY4DAeColgGBzRQUJ_eznVmZ50R0Ke3TlsEmrOeLhLSrQOJvJgA8cPrmlay5lrVkRSXdkXQUYi9D53yAZ5APEWDiyc6Hc4&guccounter=2)
 to the military’s recruiting troubles or as a way to reinvigorate [civic duty](https://time.com/5696950/bring-back-the-draft/)
 among an apathetic American populace.

Yet the threshold to execute a draft is high — as it should be."

US vetoes Security Council resolution demanding permanent ceasefire in Gaza
===========================================================================

**By** **Vibhu Mishra**

4 June 2025 [Peace and Security](/en/news/topic/peace-and-security)

A draft resolution calling for an immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza failed to pass in the UN Security Council on Wednesday after the United States cast its veto – blocking the initiative backed by all ten elected members of the Council.

The text, co-sponsored by Algeria, Denmark, Greece, Guyana, Pakistan, Panama, the Republic of Korea, Sierra Leone, Slovenia, and Somalia – collectively known as the E-10 – received 14 votes in favour, with the US casting the lone vote against.

As one of the council’s five permanent members, the US holds veto power – a negative vote that automatically blocks any resolution from going forward.

Had it been adopted, the draft would have demanded “an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Gaza” to be respected by all parties.

Release all hostages
--------------------

The text reaffirmed the Council’s earlier call for the “**immediate, dignified and unconditional release of all hostages held by Hamas and other groups**.”

The draft also expressed grave concern over the “**catastrophic humanitarian situation**” in Gaza – following months of almost total Israeli aid blockade – including the risk of famine, highlighted by recent assessments by international food security experts.

It reaffirmed the obligation of all parties to comply with international law, including international humanitarian and human rights law.

Resume flow of aid
------------------

In addition to a ceasefire, the draft resolution demanded the “**immediate and unconditional lifting of all restrictions**” on the entry and distribution of humanitarian aid in Gaza, calling for safe and unhindered access for UN and humanitarian partners across the enclave.

It also urged the restoration of essential services, in accordance with humanitarian principles and prior [Security Council](https://main.un.org/securitycouncil/)
 resolutions.

The text voiced support for ongoing mediation efforts led by Egypt, Qatar, and the United States to revive the phased ceasefire framework outlined in resolution 2735 (2024), which envisions a permanent cessation of hostilities, the release of all hostages, the exchange of Palestinian prisoners, the return of all remains, full Israeli military withdrawal from Gaza, and the start of a long-term reconstruction plan.

Draft resolution unacceptable: United States
--------------------------------------------

Speaking ahead of the vote, acting US Representative Dorothy Shea described the draft resolution as “unacceptable”.  

“US opposition to this resolution should come as no surprise – it is unacceptable for what it does say, it is unacceptable for what it does not say, and it is unacceptable for the manner in which it has been advanced,” she said.

“The United States has been clear,” she continued, “we would not support any measure that fails to condemn Hamas and does not call for Hamas to disarm and leave Gaza.”

She added that Hamas has rejected numerous ceasefire proposals, including one over the weekend that would have provided a pathway to end the conflict and release the remaining hostages.

“We cannot allow the Security Council to award Hamas’ intransigence,” Ms. As Secretary \[Marco\] Rubio has said: ‘If an ember survives, it will spark again into a fire’.” 

‘The world is watching’
-----------------------

The failure of the resolution comes as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza deepens, with UN agencies warning of the total collapse of health services, growing displacement, and a rising death toll around the new privatized US-Israel led aid distribution system which bypasses established agencies.

“The world is watching, day after day, horrifying scenes of Palestinians being shot, wounded or killed in Gaza while simply trying to eat,” said UN relief chief Tom Fletcher earlier on Wednesday.

The US has blocked a Gaza ceasefire draft resolution at the United Nations Security Council - the fourth time it has used its veto power during the conflict to shield its ally, Israel.

Fourteen of the 15 Council members voted in favour of the draft, which demanded that the war in Gaza "must end immediately, unconditionally and permanently and all remaining hostages must be immediately and unconditionally released".

Deputy US ambassador to the UN, Robert Wood, said the document "abandoned" the necessity for there to be "a linkage between a ceasefire and the release of hostages".

Critics of the veto sharply rebuked the US, with France saying it "deeply regretted" the move.

The UNSC is composed of five permanent members which have veto power - and 10 which are elected.

This group proposed the draft resolution which also "rejected any effort to starve Palestinians".

The vote was held as the UN warned that Palestinians were "facing diminishing conditions for survival" in parts of northern Gaza under siege by Israeli forces because [virtually no aid has been delivered in 40 days](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce3ypxd3p4eo)
.

Earlier this month, a UN-backed assessment said there was a strong likelihood that famine was imminent in areas of northern Gaza.

The Israeli military has said its six-week-long offensive targets regrouping Hamas fighters, and that it is facilitating civilian evacuations and supply deliveries to hospitals.

Ambassador Wood said passing the resolution would have sent a "dangerous message" to Hamas, the armed group at war with Israel, that "there's no need to come back to the negotiating table".

Israel's UN ambassador, Danny Danon, said the resolution "was not a path to peace, it was a roadmap to more terror, more suffering and more bloodshed".

"Many of you attempted to pass this injustice. We thank the United States for exercising its veto," he added.

Hamas, meanwhile, accused the US of being "directly responsible" for Israel's "genocidal war" in Gaza.

Reacting to the veto, China's ambassador said people could not help but ask: "Do Palestinian lives mean nothing?"

France said international humanitarian law was being trampled and the only response should have been an immediate and permanent ceasefire.

The UK said it wanted to end the war, stop the suffering in Gaza and secure the immediate release of all hostages.

But the harshest criticism of the US came from outside the Council doors.

Human Rights Watch's (HRW) UN director, Louis Charbonneau, accused Washington of "once again" using its veto power "to ensure impunity for Israel as its forces continue to commit crimes against Palestinians in Gaza".

Israel rejects the accusations.

The current war broke out after Hamas gunmen burst through the border and attacked Israeli communities, killing about 1,200 people, according to Israeli tallies, and taking 251 into Gaza as hostages.

More than 43,920 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.

Israel said it accepted a new draft of a U.S. The deal would pause the war for 60 days, but not permanently end it, as Hamas is demanding.
    
    Nick Schifrin is in New York now and joins us with more.
    
    So, Nick, what's in this proposal and could it be accepted by both sides?
    
*   **Nick Schifrin:**
    
    Well, Geoff, as you said, Israel has accepted this proposal, which would be a 60-day cease-fire of the war in Gaza. We call on President Trump to pressure Netanyahu and Hamas.
    
*   **Nick Schifrin:**
    
    There are American and Israeli officials, Geoff, who do believe and tell me that if President Trump were to publicly pressure Netanyahu to end the war, Netanyahu would agree.
    
    But, for now, until Hamas agrees to this draft we have been talking about or Israel changes its policy and agrees to end the war in full, the war goes on.
    
*   **Geoff Bennett:**
    
    Nick Schifrin in New York tonight.
    
    Nick, thank you for that reporting.

Nick Schifrin is PBS NewsHour’s Foreign Affairs and Defense Correspondent. The deal would pause the war for 60 days, but not permanently end it, as Hamas is demanding. Hamas would also return the bodies of 18 dead Israeli hostages.
    
    In exchange, Israel would release thousands of Palestinian detainees, including more than 100 serving life sentences. But so long as the war continues, Israel's military vows to take over 75 percent of Gaza, pushing Gazans into small areas in the south, what Israel, Geoff, calls sterile zones.
    
*   **Geoff Bennett:**
    
    And how is Israel responding to the cease-fire proposal?
    
*   **Nick Schifrin:**
    
    As we have discussed multiple times, Geoff, Israeli society is split. You see there some scuffled with police last night after they broke into the ruling Likud headquarters.
    
    And thousands of Israelis continue to fill Tel Aviv's Hostage Square to listen to hostage families argue that diplomacy is the only way forward. They may contain errors._

*   **Geoff Bennett:**
    
    Today, Israel said it accepted a new draft of a U.S. But this would not, as you said, end the war or require Israel to withdraw from Gaza."
