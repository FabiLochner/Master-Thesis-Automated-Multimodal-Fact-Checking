Useful result: From [Source](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/photo-us-army-general-killed-110919596.html): 
Content: The search result from Yahoo News states that the image shows soldiers in Iraq, not General John Pagri in the Gaza Strip. The image is old, and the uniform pattern was retired in 2019. A defense official confirmed there is no US general with this name. <image:5839>, <image:5843>, <image:5844>.

Useful result: From [Source](https://press.un.org/en/2025/db250820.doc.htm): 
Content: The United Nations website contains a transcript of the Daily Press Briefing by the Office of the Spokesperson for the Secretary-General on August 20, 2025. The briefing discusses the situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, mentioning the dire conditions, malnutrition, and the need for humanitarian aid. It also mentions the Security Council meeting on Threats to International Peace and Security caused by Terrorist Acts. The briefing does not mention General John Pagri.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/gaza-takeover-plan-said-set-to-last-4-5-months-focus-on-gaza-city-strips-center/): 
Content: The Times of Israel published an article discussing a plan for Israel to take over vast areas of the Gaza Strip, potentially over five months, displacing around a million Palestinians. The plan focuses on seizing Gaza City and expanding aid distribution centers. The article mentions the ongoing war that erupted after the Hamas-led October 7, 2023, massacre. <image:5845>. The article was published on August 8, 2024.

The claim '<image:1> This image shows General John Pagri, Commander of the Special Tasks Battalion in the U.S. Army, which has died in the Gaza Strip in April 2025.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. The image is of soldiers in Iraq, as confirmed by a reverse image search and the U.S. Army. Furthermore, there is no record of a General John Pagri, and the uniform in the image is outdated, as reported by [Yahoo News](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/photo-us-army-general-killed-110919596.html).

So, the overall veracity is: false
