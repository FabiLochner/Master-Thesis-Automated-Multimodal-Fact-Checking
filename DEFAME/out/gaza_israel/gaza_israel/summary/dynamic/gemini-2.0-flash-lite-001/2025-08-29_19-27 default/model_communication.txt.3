## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:59>

### Evidence from `web_search`
The CNN article from July 27, 2024, reports on an Israeli airstrike on a school in Deir-al Balah, central Gaza, on July 27, 2024, where at least 30 people were killed. The article does not include the image. ([https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/27/middleeast/israel-gaza-deir-al-balah-school-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/27/middleeast/israel-gaza-deir-al-balah-school-intl))

The BBC article from August 20, 2024, discusses an Israeli strike on a school in Gaza City, which was sheltering displaced people. ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9zxlpz5evo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9zxlpz5evo)) The Associated Press article from July 27, 2024, reports on an Israeli airstrike on a school in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza Strip, which killed at least 30 people, including children. ([https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-gaza-palestinians-evacuation-27-july-2024-c95e8effebd9d4e4ba7e69bfbae61e04](https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-gaza-palestinians-evacuation-27-july-2024-c95e8effebd9d4e4ba7e69bfbae61e04)) <image:k>


## Elaboration
The provided evidence does not contain the image. The reverse image search only confirms the existence of the image. The web search results describe Israeli airstrikes in Gaza in July and August 2024, including strikes on schools. However, none of the articles include the image or confirm the specific details of the claim.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available information. More information is needed to confirm the image's context, including the child's identity, the location, and the cause of the rubble.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The NBC News video shows rescue workers trying to save children trapped in the rubble after an airstrike in Gaza City. ([https://www.nbcnews.com/video/rescue-workers-fight-to-save-children-trapped-in-gaza-city-airstrike-rubble-196401733655](https://www.nbcnews.com/video/rescue-workers-fight-to-save-children-trapped-in-gaza-city-airstrike-rubble-196401733655)) <image:6780> Al Jazeera published an article about the impact of the war on children in Gaza, including an image of children amidst rubble. ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/19/israels-war-against-gazas-children-explained](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/19/israels-war-against-gazas-children-explained)) <image:6781> The NPR article includes an image of a woman sitting in rubble in Gaza. ([https://www.npr.org/2025/03/17/g-s1-54401/israel-launches-deadly-series-of-attack-on-gaza](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/17/g-s1-54401/israel-launches-deadly-series-of-attack-on-gaza)) <image:6782>


### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.51, 'Israel': 0.24, 'Jordan': 0.11, 'Russia': 0.02, 'Canada': 0.01, 'Colombia': 0.01, 'France': 0.01, 'Sweden': 0.01, 'Turkey': 0.01, 'Ukraine': 0.01}

## Elaboration
The image search provides additional images of children in rubble in Gaza, supporting the claim's general context. The geolocation data suggests the image was most likely taken in Palestine or Israel. However, the evidence still does not confirm the specific details of the claim, such as the exact date or the cause of the rubble.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified.

The story behind the photograph of a starving Gaza baby
=======================================================

A photographer in Gaza has told the story of how he captured a series of harrowing photographs, showing an emaciated child.

Ahmed al-Arini told BBC Newshour that he wanted to "show the rest of the world extreme hunger" that babies and children are experiencing in the Gaza Strip.

Global food security experts have not yet classified the situation in Gaza as a famine, but UN agencies have warned of man-made, mass starvation taking hold.

They have blamed Israel, which controls all supplies entering the Palestinian territory, but it has denied responsibility.

Israel blames Hamas for any cases of malnutrition.

The image search provides additional images of children in rubble in Gaza, supporting the claim's general context. The geolocation data suggests the image was most likely taken in Palestine or Israel. However, the evidence still does not confirm the specific details of the claim, such as the exact date or the cause of the rubble.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:59>

### Evidence from `web_search`
The CNN article from July 27, 2024, reports on an Israeli airstrike on a school in Deir-al Balah, central Gaza, on July 27, 2024, where at least 30 people were killed. The article does not include the image. ([https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/27/middleeast/israel-gaza-deir-al-balah-school-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/27/middleeast/israel-gaza-deir-al-balah-school-intl))

The BBC article from August 20, 2024, discusses an Israeli strike on a school in Gaza City, which was sheltering displaced people. ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9zxlpz5evo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9zxlpz5evo)) The Associated Press article from July 27, 2024, reports on an Israeli airstrike on a school in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza Strip, which killed at least 30 people, including children.

## Elaboration
The provided evidence does not contain the image. The reverse image search only confirms the existence of the image. The web search results describe Israeli airstrikes in Gaza in July and August 2024, including strikes on schools. However, none of the articles include the image or confirm the specific details of the claim.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available information. More information is needed to confirm the image's context, including the child's identity, the location, and the cause of the rubble.
