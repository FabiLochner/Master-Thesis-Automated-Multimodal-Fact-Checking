(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

GENE DEMBY, HOST:

What's good? One of the early ideas that inspired Baldwin's thoughts about Israel came out of the late 1880s.

ALAMED: And the idea that, you know, Black people, Black Americans - you know, speaking in American context - deserve a state, a country of their own.

ULABY: So back in the decades before James Baldwin was born, Nadia says a lot of Black intellectuals were incredibly inspired by the new Zionist movement that was emerging among Jews around the world.

DEMBY: Right. And that brings us to 1948 when James Baldwin wrote one of his first major essays.

DEMBY: 1948 - that was also the year Israel was created, right?

ULABY: Right. - 13 years old at the time.

ULABY: That visit changed James Baldwin's life but not in the way that he expected.

ALAMED: He thinks of Israel as, like, a safe haven for himself as a gay Black man. How do you define one people's freedom over - against another?

ALAMED: So that becomes a crucial step for him, and he will go back - Baldwin will go back to his trip to Israel many, many times in his writing.

DEMBY: When we come back...

FELDMAN: Baldwin shows us ways of sitting with history and sitting with pain, sitting with trauma, sitting with vulnerability.

DEMBY: That's after the break.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

DEMBY: Gene.

ULABY: Neda.

DEMBY: CODE SWITCH.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

DEMBY: So we're talking about James Baldwin, the writer and thinker whose ideas about race and power seem so prophetic that they continue to be rediscovered by new audiences at some of our most intense political moments. Both of us have stood outside the chalk circle awaiting our sentence, but the judge this time was not just.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

ULABY: James Baldwin, says Keith Feldman, saw his work as a writer as bearing witness.

FELDMAN: Bearing witness in an unvarnished way to injustice.

ULABY: So I asked, what does it have to tell us now at a moment of such pain and sorrow for Palestinians, Israelis, people across the Middle East, for us?

FELDMAN: Baldwin shows us ways of sitting with history and sitting with pain, sitting with trauma, sitting with vulnerability.

ULABY: And finding connections across cultures and geographies.

FELDMAN: Baldwin reminds us that the distance between here and there is much less than it might seem sometimes, and being able to bridge that distance is a political act and is also an act of the imagination.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

DEMBY: Once again, the story we just heard was reported by Neda Ulaby, a correspondent on NPR's culture desk. So on this episode, we're looking back to the writing of James Baldwin, whose views on the country transformed significantly over the course of his life. James Baldwin, the activist and author, was being profiled on ABC News.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

SYLVIA CHASE: James Baldwin is one of those lucky people who's never been unsure of his family's love.

DEMBY: The crew visited him at his home in Harlem and sat down for dinner with James Baldwin and his family.

(LAUGHTER)

DEMBY: And at one point, Baldwin makes this observation.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

JAMES BALDWIN: The American sense of reality is dictated by what Americans are trying to avoid.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

DEMBY: What Americans are trying to avoid - in that moment, Baldwin was talking about the American legacy of slavery."

From [Source](https://stevesalaita.com/james-baldwin-and-the-jewish-state/): 
Content: " Rather than dispensing platitudes about conflict and peace, he identifies Zionism as a concern of Western imperialism:

> Whenever Israel is mentioned one is required, it appears sometimes to me, to maintain a kind of pious silence.  Well, why?  It is a state like other states.  It has come into existence in a peculiar way.  But it does not, does not, become a state because people who wrote the Balfour Declaration, or Winston Churchill, or for that matter anyone in Europe, or in the Western world, really cared what happened to the Jews.  I wish I could say differently, but I would be lying if I did—it came into existence as a means of protecting Western interests at the gate of the Middle East. 

Baldwin reinforces this point when somebody from the audience questions the validity of implying that Israel “was set up to protect oil interests in that area.”  Baldwin responds:  “I said to protect the vital interests of the Western world, and I don’t mean to be sardonic or cynical, but I would be lying to you and lying by my own experience if I said to you that the Europeans—the English, the Dutch, the Germans, the French—impressed me as having any vivid concern for Jews.”  He returns to the theme of Jewish people being either disposable or instrumentalized in traditions of Western capitalism. 

For Baldwin, Zionism isn’t an atavistic cultural or religious attribute, but the modern articulation of an age-old colonial logic.  “In order to be a Zionist,” he notes, “it is not necessary to love the Jews.  I know some Zionists who are definitely anti-Semitic.”  This point impugns some of Zionism’s basic premises:  that Israel embodies Jewishness; that Israel is a necessary response to anti-Semitism; that Israel offers a utopian model of nationhood.  He has to be, since I am a black man, and, as he supposes, his only protection against the fate which drove him to [America](https://www.thenation.com/article/open-letter-born-again/)
.” 

Baldwin views Jewish aspirations to whiteness as a foolish conciliation to inherently hostile forces:  “But the state of Israel was not created for the salvation of the Jews; it was created for the salvation of the Western interests.  It happened to be, to spell it out, white South Africa. 

Here Baldwin reduces a baroque analysis to its essentials.  Zionism facilitates global structures of white supremacy and so cultural or religious investment in the ideology hinders an ethical politics.  Of course Israel sided with white South Africa.  Of course Israel expedites US and European machinations in the so-called Middle East.  That’s why it was created.  Destroying Palestine was a prelude to reactionary alliances. 

Last week, Facebook [revealed](https://www.apnews.com/7d334cb8793f49889be1bbf89f47ae5c)
 that an Israeli consulting firm has meddled in elections throughout the Global South, what a company spokesman called “a staggering diversity of regions.”  Baldwin wouldn’t have been surprised and neither should anybody else.  Israel, after all, is a longtime [interloper](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/israel-us-elections-intervention-russia-noam-chomsky-donald-trump-a8470481.html)
 in US elections.  In a world bifurcated according to geographies of wealth and deprivation, Israel serves the transnational class of war partisans, mercenary firms, and arms merchants. 

Baldwin recognized what too many luminaries in the Western left ignore:  Israel isn’t a reconstructed product of its surroundings or a benign ideal unmoored from some noble origin; it is a portal to limitless imposition of discipline onto an expendable, alien world.

24 thoughts on “James Baldwin and the Jewish State”
---------------------------------------------------

1. <image:6349>

For James Baldwin, nothing started or stopped at the borders of the United States.  His comments about Black-Jewish tension in the country of his birth took on worldly dimensions, offering unusual insight into domestic race relations, international affairs, and conflict in the Middle East. 

Baldwin wasn’t a policy wonk, but, befitting a person of his stature, he commented regularly on contemporary issues of global import.  Public figures don’t normally escape questions about Palestine and Israel; Baldwin was no exception.  The few times he spoke about the region reveal a thinker of significant prescience and a skilled rhetorician who doesn’t allow audiences the luxury of comfort. 

His most notable assessment of Zionism and Israel arose in context of a 1984 controversy surrounding then-Democratic presidential candidate Jesse Jackson, whose campaign represented a milestone in Black and progressive politics.  Jackson used the epithet “Hymietown” to describe New York City in what he thought was an off-the-record conversation with a journalist.  (“Hymie” is an anti-Jewish slur.)  When the comment was reported, it erupted into scandal. 

Baldwin, who claimed that “Jesse is singled out for particular reasons,” discussed the controversy at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, featured in [_The Cross of Redemption_](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.ca/books/7754/the-cross-of-redemption-by-james-baldwin-edited-with-an-introduction-by-randall-kenan/9780307275967)
, an anthology of uncollected talks, essays, and reviews (Baldwin was a stringent, at times unforgiving, reviewer).  Because the Q&A is transcribed, we get to witness Baldwin speaking extemporaneously. 

It is a remarkable document, in part because the audience doesn’t seem to get what Baldwin is saying.  Among other uses, the ideology shows how likely, even necessary, it is in imperialist cosmologies to uncouple humans who occupy a territory from the economic utility of nation-states that exist in their name. 

What does it mean to be an anti-Semitic Zionist?  (Baldwin is correct, by the way; evangelical Christian leaders, Western heads of state, and Gulf Arab billionaires all in some way fit the label.)  It shows, to begin with, that Zionism cannot deliver on its claim to preserve the well-being of Jewish people around the world.  It is first and foremost a state and as such will be oriented toward the interests of a domestic elite. for this insight take on James Baldwin’s (in turn) insightful comments on both Zionism – he nailed it – and Baldwin’s reminder – as if it needed saying – that overwhelmingly (there are a few who aren’t) that Jews, especially those of European Askinaze origins … are white!…
    
    The power of Baldwin’s thinking – far beyond his comments on Israel and the Palestinians – are returning to the mainstream after a long sleep.

Baldwin didn’t speak often of Israel, but he still managed to say plenty

!  A rupture facilitates interplay between colonization and capitalism:  confuse a people with the state, a formation devoted to inhuman pursuits, and the people will never live up to any kind of idealization; the state is incapable of—and uninterested in—the resolution of trauma. 

Anti-Semitic Zionists are possible because Israel benefits a chauvinistic ruling class; members of that class give zero shits about the health of the state’s inhabitants.  In fact, given the conditions of violence and accumulation in the Imperium, it’s _logical_ to dislike Jews and love Israel.  The alt-right didn’t [select Israel](https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/comment/2017/11/6/zionism-and-the-alt-right)
 as a model of statecraft at random. 

Baldwin wasn’t alone in this sort of analysis.  For over a century, Palestinian thinkers, along with a plethora of decolonial voices, have similarly implicated ethnonationalism.

While Baldwin was widely known for being a major voice in the civil rights movement who marched alongside Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr., a lesser-known fact about him was his enduring solidarity with Palestine and how he viewed strong parallels between Black and Palestinian liberation movements—united in their fight against oppression and imperialism.

[In a then-controversial 1979 essay for _The Nation_](https://www.thenation.com/article/society/open-letter-born-again/)
, Baldwin wrote:

But the state of Israel was not created for the salvation of the Jews; it was created for the salvation of the Western interests. In his 1972 essay “Take Me to the Water,” Baldwin explained why he refused to settle in Israel: “If I had fled to Israel, a state created for the purpose of protecting Western interests, I would have been in a tighter bind: on which side of Jerusalem would I have decided to live?”

In a 1970 interview with Ida Lewis, Baldwin even said: “I am anti-Zionist. “It’s part of the same struggle,” he told me.

With events to commemorate Baldwin’s life and legacy for his 100th anniversary planned in [New York](https://www.nypl.org/spotlight/baldwin100)

, [Paris](https://www.lamaisonbaldwin.org/centennial)
 and more, many will pay tribute to Baldwin’s writing, but no-one ought to ignore his politics rooted in solidarity, which continue to inspire new generations across the world.

As Baldwin himself once wrote: “The paradox of education is precisely this — that as one begins to become conscious one begins to examine the society in which he is being educated.”

James Baldwin and the Roots of Black-Palestinian Solidarity

### Alexander Durie Considers the Evolution of Baldwin’s Views on Zionism

Few writers can be considered as poignantly relevant decades after their passing as James Baldwin. The Palestinians have been paying for the British colonial policy of ‘divide and rule’ and for Europe’s guilty Christian conscience for more than thirty years.

Baldwin had been writing about Israel-Palestine since the early 1960s, but his views changed radically over time. It is in the late 1960s and early 1970s that, like many Black American intellectuals, Baldwin would become critical of Israel and supportive of Palestinians.

Nadia Alahmed, a Palestinian scholar, activist, and Assistant Professor of Africana Studies and Middle Eastern Studies at Dickinson, told me that “once Baldwin changed his mind about Israel, he never stopped criticizing it. Baldwin was one of the very first prolific black American voices to recognize Israel for what it really is.”

Although his self-imposed exiles in France and Turkey are well-documented, Baldwin also travelled widely in Africa and the Middle East. In September 1961, Baldwin was invited by the Israeli government for a tour of Israel, which was promoting itself as a post-racial haven intent on attracting Black American thinkers, like Baldwin, who felt alienated by their country’s enshrined racism and were looking for a new home.

According to research by Nadia Alahmed in _[The Shape of the Wrath to Come](https://www.jstor.org/stable/48664822)
_ and Keith Feldman in _[A Shadow over Palestine: The Imperial Life of Race in America](https://bookshop.org/p/books/a-shadow-over-palestine-the-imperial-life-of-race-in-america-keith-p-feldman/11894178/?aid=132)
_, Baldwin was—like many Americans—initially optimistic about Israel and the idea of a nation for Jewish people, a group that had been violently discriminated and traumatized.

Baldwin recounted in “Letters from a Journey” that he was treated like an “extremely well cared for parcel post package” by the Israelis in 1961, and that “Israel and I seem to like each other” upon first impressions. He visited the Negev desert, the Dead Sea, Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Haifa, and a kibbutz near the Gaza Strip.

But this romanticized view of Israel didn’t last long for Baldwin, who had grown up poor in Harlem and the grand-child of a slave. And he also says, ‘wherever we would go, there was always a border.’ He’s very acutely aware that brown and black Jewish people in Israel are second class citizens,” Alahmed said.

It was about a decade later that Baldwin started publicly adopting an anti-Zionist stance."

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:32> This image shows Palestinian baby Sham Imad Muhareb which did not lose her arm in an Israeli airstrike on the Shejaeya neighborhood, east of Gaza City, in April 2025."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:32>)
web_search("Sham Imad Muhareb")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://www.thedailyfile.org/post/sham-imad-muhareb): 
Content: The Daily File states that the image is of Sham Imad Muhareb, who was 5 months old and died in Shuja'iya on April 10, 2025. <image:32>


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the image is of Sham Imad Muhareb. The Daily File states that she died in Shuja'iya on April 10, 2025. The claim does not mention the cause of death.

The claim states that the baby did not lose her arm in an Israeli airstrike. The evidence does not mention the cause of death.

The claim is partially supported by the evidence. More information is needed to verify the cause of death.

Content: The Daily File states that the image is of Sham Imad Muhareb, who was 5 months old and died in Shuja'iya on April 10, 2025. <image:32>


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the image is of Sham Imad Muhareb. The Daily File states that she died in Shuja'iya on April 10, 2025. The claim does not mention the cause of death.

The claim states that the baby did not lose her arm in an Israeli airstrike. The evidence does not mention the cause of death.

The claim is partially supported by the evidence. More information is needed to verify the cause of death.

Dozens of people were also wounded in the strike on a multi-storey building in Gaza City's Shejaiya neighbourhood

At least 29 Palestinians, including children, have been killed in an Israeli air strike on a multi-storey residential building in the east of Gaza City, a local hospital says.

The Hamas-run Civil Defence agency said warplanes targeted the area near al-Hawashi mosque in the Shejaiya neighbourhood on Tuesday morning.

It initially reported that 23 people were killed but warned its first responders were searching for two dozen others under the rubble. <image:6404>!AFP Palestinians search for survivors and bodies in the rubble of a residential building destroyed in an Israeli air strike, in the Shejaiya neighbourhood of Gaza City, northern Gaza (9 April 2025) <image:6408>AFP

Israel's military said the strike targeted a senior Hamas figure

Earlier on Tuesday, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said at least 33 people had been killed in Israeli attacks over the previous 24 hours.

That brought the reported total of those killed since Israel resumed its air and ground campaign against Hamas on 18 March to 1,482.

The Israeli military meanwhile said its aircraft had struck more than 45 "terror targets" across Gaza over the past day, including weapons manufacturing sites and rocket launchers.

It also said ground forces were advancing into Shejaiya as well as the so-called "Morag Corridor" in southern Gaza.

The military corridor is being established by seizing territory between the city of Rafah, whose residents have been ordered to evacuate, and neighbouring Khan Younis.

During a visit to the area on Wednesday, Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said: "We are now slicing through the strip, and we are increasing the pressure step by step, so that they \[Hamas\] will give us our hostages." ​

"All of Rafah will be evacuated and turned into a security area. Hamas used this aid to rebuild its war machine," spokesman Oren Marmonstein said.

On Monday, the heads of six UN humanitarian agencies had described Israel's assertion there was enough food for Gaza's 2.1 million population as "far from reality on the ground".

They called for the protection of civilians, the facilitation of aid deliveries, the release of the hostages held by Hamas, and the renewal of the ceasefire.

Mediators are continuing to try to resurrect the ceasefire, which started on 19 January and saw Hamas release 33 Israeli hostages - eight of them dead - and five Thai hostages in exchange for about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and a surge in humanitarian aid entering Gaza.

Israel said it resumed its offensive due to Hamas's refusal to accept a proposal for an extension of the ceasefire deal's first phase and the release of more of the 59 hostages it is still holding, up to 24 of whom are believed to be alive.

Hamas accused Israel of violating the original agreement, according to which there would be a second phase where all the remaining living hostages would be handed over and the war brought to a permanent end.

The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.

More than 50,840 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry.

_Correction 10 April 2025: This article originally said the Israeli defence minister was quoted by the Jerusalem Post. In the evening, it announced 15 bodies had been recovered, without giving an updated death toll.

The Israeli military said it had struck a "senior Hamas terrorist" who was responsible for planning and executing attacks in the area.

Numerous steps were taken to mitigate harm to civilians, including the use of "precision weapons", it added.

The military also accused Hamas of violating international law by deliberately using the civilian population as human shields.

Video from Shejaiya showed the dust-covered bodies of small children being carried away from the rubble by distraught relatives and rescue workers.

Ayub Salim, 26, told the AFP news agency the area around the residential building struck on Tuesday morning was "overcrowded with tents, displaced people and homes".

He said it was hit by "multiple missiles" and that "shrapnel flew in all directions".

"Dust and massive destruction filled the entire place, we couldn't see anything, just the screams and panic of the people," he added. "It is truly a horrific massacre."

Hamas also said the Israeli military had "committed a bloody massacre".

Thousands of Shejaiya residents fled last week after the Israeli military ordered the evacuation of much of the neighbourhood, saying it was operating with force to destroy "terrorist infrastructure".

But residents said the area struck on Wednesday was not covered by the evacuation order, so many families had remained there.

"We were told this was a safe area for the displaced, yet they are targeting residential blocks with lethal missiles. Do they fire rockets at the Israeli army?" an elderly man in Shejaiya told BBC Arabic's Gaza Lifeline programme.

! This is what we are doing now," he added, [according to the Ynet news website](https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1v6d4vryx)
.

The BBC has asked the Israeli military for comment.

Another 390,000 people have been displaced over the past three weeks, with two-thirds of the territory now designated by the Israeli military as "no-go" zones or placed under evacuation orders, according to the UN.

The UN has also warned that supplies of food, medicine and fuel have dried up because Israel has prevented any deliveries of humanitarian aid for a month to put pressure on Hamas.

On Tuesday, Secretary General António Guterres condemned the Israeli blockade, saying it violated international law and had opened "the floodgates of horror".

"Gaza is a killing field and civilians are in an endless death loop," he added.

The Israeli foreign ministry rejected Guterres' criticism, saying he had "not let the facts get in the way when spreading slander against Israel".

"There is no shortage of humanitarian aid in the Gaza Strip - over 25,000 aid trucks have entered the Gaza Strip in the 42 days of the ceasefire."

LONDON -- The Israel Defense Forces said Friday morning that its [ground troops began operating](https://abcnews.go.com/International/israeli-operation-gaza-expanding-seize-large-areas-defense/story?id=120401894)
 in the Shejaiya area of the northern Gaza Strip "in order to expand the security zone," apparently referencing Israel's buffer zone along the Gaza border.

"As part of the activity, the troops eliminated numerous terrorists and dismantled Hamas terrorist infrastructure, including a command and control center that served Hamas terrorists to plan and execute terror attacks," the IDF said in a statement.

"During and prior to the activity, IDF troops are allowing the evacuation of civilians from the combat zone via organized routes for their safety," the statement said.

Israel is demanding the immediate release of all remaining hostages -- consisting of 59 people, 24 of whom are still believed to be alive -- who were abducted to Gaza during the Hamas-led surprise attack on southern Israel on Oct. That ceasefire saw 33 Israeli hostages released by Hamas in exchange for some 1,800 Palestinian prisoners, some of whom Israeli officials alleged were serving life sentences for murder and other violent crimes.

[### MORE: Israeli operation in Gaza expanding to seize 'large areas,' defense minister says](https://abcnews.go.com/International/israeli-operation-gaza-expanding-seize-large-areas-defense/story?id=120401894)

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement that he ordered renewed strikes after Hamas refused Israeli demands to free half of the remaining hostages as a precondition for extending the ceasefire, the first phase of which expired on March 1.

[! Some 1,200 people were killed in Israel during the attack, according to the Israeli government.

Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that governs Gaza, has accused Netanyahu of intentionally collapsing the ceasefire. On Friday, Hamas called for "days of rage and anger against the occupation and its backers until it ceases its aggression and completely lifts its siege on the Gaza Strip."

A Palestinian man wounded in an Israeli strike reacts as he sits on the floor at a hospital, in Jabalia, in the northern Gaza Strip on October 5, 2024 \[File: Hussam Al-Zaanin/Reuters\]

Published On 6 Oct 20246 Oct 2024

The Israeli military has carried out intense bombardment in the Jabalia refugee camp, killing at least 17 people hours after forcing residents in the area to leave again during its third ground assault on the densely populated camp in northern Gaza since launching the war a year ago.

The Palestinian Civil Defence agency said [on Sunday](/news/liveblog/2024/10/6/live-israel-carries-out-very-violent-bombing-campaign-on-beirut)
 that the death toll included nine children following air attacks and as the army deployed tanks into the area for the first time in months.

The Palestinian Civil Defence spokesperson in Gaza, Mahmoud Basal, added that Jabalia was targeted with multiple strikes overnight, resulting in many casualties. It felt like the early days of the war,” Raed, 52, from Jabalia, told the Reuters news agency before his family left for Gaza City on Sunday.

On Sunday morning, the Israeli military said its forces had “successfully” encircled the refugee camp and were operating in the area.

The army said the decision was taken after intelligence indicated the “presence of terrorists and terror infrastructure in the area of Jabalia … as well as efforts by Hamas to rebuild its operational capabilities in the area”.

Israel has destroyed hospitals, schools and residential areas, claiming Hamas was operating under them but providing no proof of its claims. Rights organisations say these attacks amount to war crimes.

Meanwhile, the armed wing of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad has said its fighters have targeted “a command and control room” belonging to Israeli forces who were trying to get into Jabalia refugee camp.

‘Deteriorating’ situation
-------------------------

Reporting from near the Kamal Adwan Hospital in Jabalia, journalist Moath al-Kahlout said that the situation in the north was “deteriorating”, adding that an “entire family” had been killed in the overnight attacks.

“The Israeli army dropped leaflets on the Jabalia refugee camp ordering people to flee their homes, and this alarming development suggests that the Israeli army is preparing for further attacks. This may lead to more civilian deaths and injuries,” he said.

Military and security analyst Elijah Magnier says Israel’s renewed ground invasion of northern Gaza was “inevitable” as far-right Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich claimed that Palestinian armed resistance groups had recruited “more than a thousand people”.

“Israelis have returned to Gaza several times, they’ve returned to the north several times, they’ve destroyed the infrastructure, the hospitals, everything,” Magnier told Al Jazeera.

“They will continue doing so unless \[Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin\] Netanyahu stops this war.”

Evacuation orders
-----------------

The Israeli army has called on Palestinians in northern Gaza to flee to designated “safe zones” in southern and central Gaza as it begins a renewed ground offensive. Residents in Jabalia have described the intensified attacks as some of the worst in months.

“Dozens of explosions from air strikes and tank shelling shook the ground and buildings. But no place in Gaza is safe for Palestinians, including the so-called “safe zones”, campaigners say.

But as some Palestinians begin making the journey southwards, Gaza’s Interior Ministry has called on residents to ignore Israel’s evacuation orders.

“Israeli claims about the presence of safe zones in southern Gaza are lies as Israel commits crimes and massacres in all areas of the enclave,” the ministry said in a statement.

“We call on citizens in northern Gaza to ignore Israeli threats.”

Reporting from Deir el-Balah in central Gaza, Al Jazeera’s Hind Khoudary said the difference this time, compared to earlier evacuation orders, is that it is “not only blocks but whole areas”.

“Some of those Palestinians who were in the north have refused to evacuate despite the attacks and also the starvation and harsh conditions the blockade has imposed on them. They still refuse to leave,” Khoudary said.

She added that a member of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) was also targeted in Sunday’s strikes and was killed.

According to Gaza’s Health Ministry, at least 41,870 Palestinians have been killed and 97,166 others injured since the war began on October 7.

Between 10.30am and 11.30am on 9 October last year, five Israeli airstrikes tore through the market, killing dozens of people.

They were the opening salvoes of a devastating Israeli campaign, conducted in three waves, that has left the camp an unrecognisable wasteland of rubble.

“This year is one of the worst I have experienced,” said 33-year-old Ahlam al-Tlouli, who comes from the Tal al-Zaatar area of the camp. The deadliest, on 31 October, [killed scores of people](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/01/jabalia-camp-airstrike-gaza)
 and left large craters in the ground at a busy junction.

Israel said the camp was a command centre for Hamas’s northern brigade and that it had identified Hamas tunnel systems under the camp. “No house, person, tree or stone was spared.”

‘Jabaliya is like hell’
-----------------------

**The third offensive: October 2024 – ongoing**

The heavy damage inflicted on Jabaliya during the second offensive paled in comparison with the destruction levelled since 5 October, when Israeli forces returned in large numbers for a third time.

Over the course of the offensive – which targeted Jabaliya city as well as the camp – whole groupings of buildings have been demolished, replaced in some areas by bulldozed lanes to accommodate Israeli armour and tank berms. In late January, Israel withdrew from the camp.

‘All the houses were in ruins’
------------------------------

**The second offensive: May 2024**

Intermittent clashes continued throughout January despite Israeli claims that Hamas had been defeated in Jabaliya. This footage from April shows damage to buildings along two roads in the camp.

[Damaged buildings in Jabaliya refugee camp.](https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/looping-video/index.html?poster-image=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.guim.co.uk%2F2024%2F11%2F29%2F28_Nov_Jabalia_Loops4.jpg&mp4-video=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.guim.co.uk%2F2024%2F11%2F29%2F28_Nov_Jabalia_Loops4.mp4)

On 11 May the IDF reported that Hamas had managed to reconstitute its military capabilities, and it issued a new round of evacuation orders to civilians. In footage posted online in recent weeks, bulldozers and backhoes can be seen pulling down structures.

[Backhoe used to pull down building in October 2024.](https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/looping-video/index.html?poster-image=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.guim.co.uk%2F2024%2F11%2F29%2F28_Nov_Jabalia_Loops6.jpg&mp4-video=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.guim.co.uk%2F2024%2F11%2F29%2F28_Nov_Jabalia_Loops6.mp4)

Some neighbourhoods have almost entirely disappeared, including block 4, which included the camp’s main school complex.

“There are bodies on the roads and under the rubble,” said Mahmoud Basal, 39, a civil defence official. It has an awful momentum.”

Other observers detect a more deliberate agenda in Jabaliya and across northern Gaza: the slow enactment of a scorched earth policy known as the “generals’ plan”, aimed at driving out civilians from areas by declaring them “closed military zones” where anyone who stays is considered a combatant and all aid and other supplies are cut.

Regardless of the intention, whole-scale destruction of neighbourhoods has taken place across the north of Gaza, including in the camp.

[Satellite image of Jabaliya refugee camp from 12 Nov 2024](https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/12/jabaliya_12-nov-2023_tue_final/giv-4559UcmYNSAvUq79)

A document circulated to Israeli combat soldiers in recent weeks, [revealed by the Israeli newspaper Haaretz](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/security-aviation/2024-11-13/ty-article-magazine/.premium/idf-gearing-up-to-remain-in-gaza-until-end-of-2025-at-least-this-is-what-it-looks-like/00000193-2230-d76d-a7db-637196a00000)
, talks of “exposing large areas” – a euphemism, the paper says, for destroying buildings and infrastructure in such a way that Hamas fighters cannot hide in them but no one can live in them either.

Nadia Hardman, a researcher at Human Rights Watch, said HRW had identified a pattern in Jabaliya and across the north of Israeli forces clearing territory for buffer zones and security corridors.

“People can argue whether the campaign of bombing is reckless destruction or part of the hostilities, but taking control of an area and intentionally destroying it looks far more systematic,” Hardman said.

In a statement, the IDF said: “The IDF is currently operating in northern Gaza against terrorist targets due to Hamas’s efforts to restore its operational capabilities in the area … The IDF targets only military objectives. “Homes, streets, health and educational facilities – everything is gone.”

Background
----------

Further information: [Battle of Beit Hanoun](/wiki/Battle_of_Beit_Hanoun "Battle of Beit Hanoun")
 and [Battle of Jabalia](/wiki/Battle_of_Jabalia "Battle of Jabalia")

Fighting between Palestinian militants and the IDF had taken place in [Beit Hanoun](/wiki/Beit_Hanoun "Beit Hanoun")
 and Jabalia since 27 October 2023 and 8 November 2023, respectively.[\[29\]](#cite_note-29)
[\[6\]](#cite_note-:0-6)
 The IDF also launched raids into [Beit Lahia](/wiki/Beit_Lahia "Beit Lahia")
 such as the [Kamal Adwan Hospital sieges](/wiki/Kamal_Adwan_Hospital_sieges "Kamal Adwan Hospital sieges")
 in December 2024 and May 2024.[\[30\]](#cite_note-30)
[\[31\]](#cite_note-31)
[\[32\]](#cite_note-32)

The IDF encountered "significant resistance" during the [fighting in Jabalia](/wiki/Battle_of_Jabalia "Battle of Jabalia")
[\[6\]](#cite_note-:0-6)
 and ultimately failed to dismantle Hamas' presence in the city.[\[33\]](#cite_note-:6-33)

On 31 May 2024, the IDF withdrew from North Gaza, including both Beit Hanoun and Jabalia.[\[34\]](#cite_note-34)
[\[35\]](#cite_note-35)

In the four months since the Israeli withdrawal, Hamas reportedly reconstituted itself in Jabalia and managed to recruit thousands of new fighters in the area.[\[6\]](#cite_note-:0-6)
 Hamas also planted explosives in almost all buildings in Jabalia, sometimes even causing the death of its own militants.[\[36\]](#cite_note-36)

### Jabalia

On the evening of 5 October,[\[4\]](#cite_note-:dateclarification1-4)
[\[5\]](#cite_note-:dateclarification2-5)
 the IDF began its stated operation to dismantle Hamas control in Jabalia, with the [Israeli Air Force](/wiki/Israeli_Air_Force "Israeli Air Force")
 launching strikes around the area while armored brigades encircled the [Jabalia refugee camp](/wiki/Jabalia_refugee_camp "Jabalia refugee camp")
.[\[6\]](#cite_note-:0-6)

The IDF advanced into Jabalia and were met by combined attacks from Hamas, [Palestinian Islamic Jihad](/wiki/Palestinian_Islamic_Jihad "Palestinian Islamic Jihad")
 (PIJ), [al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades](/wiki/Al-Aqsa_Martyrs%27_Brigades "Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades")
, and the [Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine](/wiki/Popular_Front_for_the_Liberation_of_Palestine "Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine")
 (PFLP).[\[6\]](#cite_note-:0-6)
 PIJ launched an attack on an Israeli [command and control room](/wiki/Command_center "Command center")
 belonging to forces attempting to penetrate the Jabalia refugee camp.[\[37\]](#cite_note-:1-37)

On 10 October, Hamas organized an ambush which destroyed an IDF mechanized infantry company of 12 vehicles east of the Jabalia camp.[\[38\]](#cite_note-:2-38)
[\[39\]](#cite_note-39)
[\[40\]](#cite_note-40)
 The IDF said that an Israeli airstrike on a Hamas command and control centre killed at least 12 Hamas and PIJ commanders.[\[38\]](#cite_note-:2-38)

On 13 October, Israeli prime minister [Benjamin Netanyahu](/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu "Benjamin Netanyahu")
 stated that the IDF had reached "the heart of Jabalia" and were dismantling Hamas strongholds there. He is considered to have been the highest-ranking officer to have died in ground combat since the start of the Gaza war.[\[45\]](#cite_note-45)
[\[46\]](#cite_note-46)

On 22 October, Hamas said that its fighters detonated an explosive device targeting 12 Israeli soldiers in the Jabalia refugee camp, killing and wounding some of them.[\[47\]](#cite_note-47)

On 17 November, Israeli media reported that that IDF soldiers preparing an ambush in southern Jabalia were themselves ambushed by Hamas fighters.[\[48\]](#cite_note-48)

On 20 December, a Hamas fighter carried out a suicide bombing against an IDF position in the Jabalia camp.[\[49\]](#cite_note-49)

On 30 December, Palestinian militants carried out a "relatively large attack" in multiple waves against IDF positions around the Jabalia camp.[\[50\]](#cite_note-50)

### Beit Lahia

On 11 October, clashes between the IDF and Hamas were reported to be taking place in Beit Lahia.[\[51\]](#cite_note-51)
 Palestinian health officials stated on 27 October that Israeli strikes had killed at least 87 people.[\[52\]](#cite_note-52)
 On 28 October, an Israeli attack on the Beit Lahia residential square reportedly killed 45 people, with more than 30 trapped under the rubble.[\[53\]](#cite_note-53)
 After residents of Jabalia fled to Beit Lahia, the IDF then reportedly turned their attention to the town.[\[54\]](#cite_note-54)
 Sam Rose, a UN official, stated, "People who fled to Beit Lahiya have themselves been bombed".[\[55\]](#cite_note-55)
 Beit Lahia declared a state of emergency due to Israel's siege and attacks, stating, "We declare that the city is a disaster area due to the Israeli war of extermination and siege, and it has no food, water, hospitals, doctors, services, or communications".[\[56\]](#cite_note-56)

Five people were reportedly killed by Israeli airstrikes in Beit Lahia on 1 November.[\[57\]](#cite_note-57)
 Rescue teams were also attacked, with three members hit by a drone, while the civil defence stated an Israeli tank destroyed their only fire truck.[\[58\]](#cite_note-58)
 At least twenty people were reportedly killed during an attack on 4 November, with video showing residents pulling bodies out of the rubble.[\[59\]](#cite_note-59)

On 23 December, Hamas said that some of its fighters stormed an IDF position at a building in Beit Lahia and managed to free several Palestinians who had been detained inside.[\[60\]](#cite_note-60)

### Beit Hanoun

In Beit Hanoun, the IDF conducted bombings on the night of 11–12 November and targeted fleeing civilians with drones and sniper fire the next day.[\[61\]](#cite_note-61)

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Al Jazeera reported on an Israeli ground offensive on Jabalia on October 6, 2024, resulting in at least 17 deaths, with tank deployment and evacuation orders (<image:1>). The Palestinian Islamic Jihad targeted an Israeli command and control room in Jabalia. The Guardian discussed the destruction of the Jabaliya refugee camp in Gaza by Israeli forces, with the third offensive starting on October 5, 2024, and included satellite images and videos showing the destruction of buildings and infrastructure in the camp (<image:1>, <image:2>, <image:3>, <image:4>, <image:5>, <image:6>).

PBS NewsHour published an article about Israeli airstrikes in the Jabalia refugee camp in Gaza (<image:6424>). The BBC News website contains an image of an Israeli tank (<image:6425>).

The provided sources do not confirm the claim that the image shows an Israeli tank unit near Jabalia camp that was successfully ambushed by Hamas fighters in October 2024.


# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that there was an Israeli ground offensive on Jabalia in October 2024, and that Hamas fighters were active in the area. Specifically, Wikipedia mentions an ambush by Hamas on October 10, 2024, which destroyed an IDF mechanized infantry company east of the Jabalia camp. However, the evidence does not directly link the image to this specific event.

Therefore, while the claim's context is supported by the evidence, the image's specific association with the ambush cannot be verified. More information is needed to confirm the image's origin and the circumstances of the tank's destruction.

The provided sources do not confirm the claim that the image shows an Israeli tank unit near Jabalia camp that was successfully ambushed by Hamas fighters in October 2024.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that there was an Israeli ground offensive on Jabalia in October 2024, and that Hamas fighters were active in the area. Specifically, Wikipedia mentions an ambush by Hamas on October 10, 2024, which destroyed an IDF mechanized infantry company east of the Jabalia camp. However, the evidence does not directly link the image to this specific event.

Therefore, while the claim's context is supported by the evidence, the image's specific association with the ambush cannot be verified. More information is needed to confirm the image's origin and the circumstances of the tank's destruction.

Israel declares ‘state of war’ after Hamas militants launch surprise attack from Gaza (videos)

Palestinian Islamist group, Hamas launched the biggest attack on Israel  on Saturday morning, October 7 in a surprise assault as several gunmen crossed into different Israeli towns while a heavy barrage of rockets are fired from the Gaza Strip.

As at press time, warning sirens sounded across southern and central Israel, including in Jerusalem.

At least 40 people have been killed since Hamas launched the surprise attack on Israel, the country’s emergency service said.

Another 779 people have been wounded, according to the Israeli Health Ministry.

  
Israel’s military said it was on a war footing and the defense minister said the Iran-backed Hamas had made a “grave mistake” by declaring war on Israel, in retaliation, Israeli military launched air strikes into Gaza.

  
Israeli Defense Minister Gallant said Hamas had “launched a war against the State of Israel”. Israeli “troops are fighting against the enemy at every location”, he said.

![Israel declares ](https://alexis.lindaikejisblog.com/photos/shares/107313160-1696661234669-gettyimages-1711150149-20090101231007-911-002189_1696674381.jpeg)

  
The Israeli military said its forces were operating inside Gaza but gave no details.

> “A number of terrorists have infiltrated into Israeli territory from the Gaza Strip,” the military said in a statement, adding that residents in the area surrounding the Gaza Strip had been told to stay in their homes.

The attack marked an unprecedented infiltration by an unknown number of Hamas gunmen into Israel from Gaza, and one of the most serious escalations in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in decades.

Israeli media reported gunbattles between bands of Palestinian fighters and security forces in towns in southern Israel. Israel’s police chief said there were “21 active scenes” in southern Israel.

  
In Gaza, people rushed to buy supplies in anticipation of days of war ahead. Some evacuated their homes and headed for shelters.

  
Hamas military commander, Mohammad Deif announced the start of the operation in a broadcast on Hamas media, calling on Palestinians everywhere to fight.

![Israel declares ](https://alexis.lindaikejisblog.com/photos/shares/107313161-1696664544161-gettyimages-1711245488-AFP_33XP63Y_1696674371.jpeg)

  
“This is the day of the greatest battle to end the last occupation on earth,” he said, adding that 5,000 rockets had been launched.

Speaking to Israel N12 News by phone from a Nir Oz, a kibbutz near Gaza, a woman identified as Dorin said militants had infiltrated her house and tried to open the bomb shelter where she was hiding.

>   
> “They just came in again, please send help,” she said. “There are a lot of homes harmed … My husband is holding the door closed … They are firing rounds of bullets.”

Palestinian media reported that a number of Israelis had been taken captive by fighters and Hamas media circulated video footage apparently showing a destroyed Israeli tank.

  
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in  a speech this morning said the country was in war. His office said he would meet top security officials in the coming hours.

  
The Palestinian Islamic Jihad group said its fighters were joining Hamas in the attack.

  
“We are part of this battle, our fighters are side-by-side with their brothers in the Qassam Brigades until victory is achieved,” said Islamic Jihad armed wing spokesman Abu Hamza on a post on Telegram.

  
The attack came a day after Israel marked the 50th anniversary of the 1973 war that brought the country to the verge of catastrophic defeat in a surprise attack by Syria and Egypt.

Another video appeared to a crowd of Palestinian men dancing around and on top of a burning Israeli tank. The authenticity of the videos could not immediately be verified.  <br>>   <br>> Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was to meet with his top security officials on Saturday morning.  <br>>   <br>> Al Jazeera’s Rob Reynolds, reporting from occupied East Jerusalem, said the “element of surprise” in the early morning attack which appeared to involve Palestinian fighters in trucks inside Israel and on paragliders, in addition to the rocket fire, will leave Israelis “shocked and stunned”.<br><br>  <br>[SOURCE](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/7/sirens-warn-of-rockets-launched-towards-israel-from-gaza-news-reports)<br><br>**10 Likes** **3 Shares**<br><br>([Share⤴](#)<br>)<br><br>*   ![](/static/copypost.svg/3)Copy Post<br><br>* * *<br><br>*   ![](/static/whatsapp.svg/3)WhatsApp<br><br>* * *<br><br>*   ![](/static/telegram.svg/3)Telegram<br><br>* * *<br><br>*   ![](/static/twitter.svg/3)Twitter<br><br>* * *<br><br>*   ![](/static/facebook.svg/3)Facebook<br><br>![](https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/17740638_img20231007063148_jpeg0756aad4954d77978ecd178fbbf6930c)<br><br>![](https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/17740639_screenmaster20231007063416_jpeg8a2723256f4e323049af97dfa8770b6f)<br><br>![](https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/17740640_img20231007064058_jpeg7dcde991e6026c7a8397b6e3a5f2cf93)<br><br>![](https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/17740641_img20231007064203_jpeg6ab49057eb636386ec9a67b195b39b00) |

| I want to believe no terrorist will moan when the mighty hand of Israel hit them hard. I've always said it, these religious lot are nothing but a bunch of barbarians. Give 'em an inch and they'll sink your country like the Titanic. Just look at what's been going on up north in Nigeria. The whole point of their religion seems to be causing trouble and chaos, so it's no surprise that their followers are just as bad.  <br>  <br>They're a bunch of hypocrites, aren't they? They blow things up, run and hide, then come out crying when the Israelis strike back. They use civilians as human shields, the bloody cowards! It's like they have no shame. All they know how to do is make trouble, then play the victim when things go south. They're a bunch of chancers, the lot of them. Bloody cowards!  <br>  <br>I 'ope these ruddy terrorists know that the Israelis don't muck about when it comes to lookin' out for their own. If any of their Yank cousins got caught up in it, it'd be a right proper problem for them. I think they've forgotten about what happened in Munich, and the consequences after that. This could be right nasty, if you get my drift.

# Instructions
In order to find evidence that helps your fact-check, you just ran a web search which yielded a Search Result. **Your task right now is to summarize the Search Result.** What to include:
* information that might be useful for the fact-check (see Record)
* relevant images (refer to images by inserting their reference <image:k>)
* if available: the release date as well as the author or the publisher (e.g. the media company) of the search result.

Do NOT include:
* advertisements
* any other information not related to the Record or the Claim

Additional rules:
* Do not add any additional information besides the information in the Search Result.
* If the Search Result doesn't contain any relevant information for the fact-checking work, simply print one word in capital letters: "NONE".
* Keep your writing style like in the Examples 1, 2 and 3 provided to you.
* Try to filter out relevant information even if the search result is in a different language.

# Example 1
The search result from America Today provides several photographs of the Notre-Dame Cathedral fire on April 15, 2019. <image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>. None of the images show the Eiffel Tower in the background. 

# Example 2
NONE

# Example 3
The Guardian discusses a report blaming the Syrian government for a toxic gas attack and condemning their use of chemical weapons. The Guardian mentions the Chemical Weapons Convention and the responsibilities of Syria under the convention. According to The Guardian, The White House condemned the Assad regime for defying the norm against chemical weapons use.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:34> This image shows an Israeli tank unit near Jabalia camp in northern Gaza that was successfully ambushed by Hamas fighters, destroying multiple vehicles and injuring or killing their crews in October 2024."

## Actions
```
web_search("Israeli tank Jabalia camp Hamas ambush October 2024")
image_search("Israeli tank destroyed Jabalia Gaza")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Al Jazeera reported on an Israeli ground offensive on Jabalia on October 6, 2024, resulting in at least 17 deaths, with tank deployment and evacuation orders (<image:1>). The Palestinian Islamic Jihad targeted an Israeli command and control room in Jabalia. The Guardian discussed the destruction of the Jabaliya refugee camp in Gaza by Israeli forces, with the third offensive starting on October 5, 2024, and included satellite images and videos showing the destruction of buildings and infrastructure in the camp (<image:1>, <image:2>, <image:3>, <image:4>, <image:5>, <image:6>).

Wikipedia discusses the Siege of North Gaza, which took place from October 5, 2024, to January 19, 2025, as part of the Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip. The article mentions the involvement of Israeli forces and Hamas fighters in Jabalia, Beit Lahia, and Beit Hanoun. On October 10, Hamas organized an ambush which destroyed an IDF mechanized infantry company of 12 vehicles east of the Jabalia camp.


### Evidence from `image_search`
Al Jazeera reports on battles in northern Gaza, mentioning Palestinian fighters ambushing Israeli troops (<image:6423>). PBS NewsHour published an article about Israeli airstrikes in the Jabalia refugee camp in Gaza (<image:6424>). The BBC News website contains an image of an Israeli tank (<image:6425>).

The provided sources do not confirm the claim that the image shows an Israeli tank unit near Jabalia camp that was successfully ambushed by Hamas fighters in October 2024.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that there was an Israeli ground offensive on Jabalia in October 2024, and that Hamas fighters were active in the area. Specifically, Wikipedia mentions an ambush by Hamas on October 10, 2024, which destroyed an IDF mechanized infantry company east of the Jabalia camp. However, the evidence does not directly link the image to this specific event.

Therefore, while the claim's context is supported by the evidence, the image's specific association with the ambush cannot be verified. More information is needed to confirm the image's origin and the circumstances of the tank's destruction.


## Actions
```

    **আল-কাসসামের সফল অপারেশন: খান ইউনিসে ইহুদিবাদী দখলদারদের দুটি ট্যাংক ধ্বংস**
    
    ! <image:4221>
    
      
      
      
      
    ইহুদিবাদী দখলদার ইসরায়েলের নৃশংসতা ও অত্যাচারের বিরুদ্ধে ফিলিস্তিনি মুজাহিদদের সংগ্রাম অব্যাহত রয়েছে। আল-কাসসাম ব্রিগেডস তাদের সর্বশেষ অপারেশনে ইসরায়েলি দখলদার বাহিনীর দুটি মেরকাভা ট্যাংক ধ্বংস করেছে। খান ইউনিসের আবু হামিদ এলাকায় সংঘটিত এই অপারেশনে ইয়াসিন-১০৫ শেল ও সাইড আইইডি ব্যবহার করে ইহুদিবাদী সন্ত্রাসীদের উপর কঠোর প্রতিশোধ নেওয়া হয়েছে।  
      
    আল-কাসসাম ব্রিগেডস ১৪ আগস্ট, বৃহস্পতিবার এক বিবৃতিতে জানিয়েছে যে তাদের যোদ্ধারা কেন্দ্রীয় খান ইউনিসের আবু হামিদ এলাকায় ইহুদিবাদী দখলদার বাহিনীর দুটি মেরকাভা ট্যাংক লক্ষ্য করে দুটি ইয়াসিন-১০৫ শেল ও একটি সাইড আইইডি’র বিস্ফোরণ ঘটিয়ে সেগুলো সফলভাবে ধ্বংস করেছে। এই অপারেশনটি গাজা উপত্যকায় ইসরায়েলের অব্যাহত গণহত্যা, ধ্বংসযজ্ঞ ও মানবতাবিরোধী অপরাধের জবাব হিসেবে পরিচালিত হয়েছে।  
      
    ইসরায়েলি দখলদার বাহিনী ২০২৩ সাল থেকে গাজায় নৃশংস হামলা চালাচ্ছে। আন্তর্জাতিক আদালতের রায় উপেক্ষা করে ইহুদিবাদী সন্ত্রাসীরা গাজায় অবরোধ দিয়ে, খাদ্য ও ওষুধের সংকট সৃষ্টি করে মানবিক বিপর্যয় ডেকে এনেছে। এমনকি বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা (WHO) ও জাতিসংঘ বারবার সতর্ক করেও ইসরায়েলের নৃশংসতা বন্ধ করতে পারেনি।  
      
    এই পরিস্থিতিতে আল-কাসসাম ব্রিগেডসের মতো ফিলিস্তিনি প্রতিরোধ গ্রুপগুলোর অপারেশন ইহুদিবাদী দখলদারদের জন্য ক্রমাগত চ্যালেঞ্জ হয়ে দাঁড়িয়েছে। গত জুলাই মাসেও আল-কাসসাম ও আল-কুদস ব্রিগেডস যৌথভাবে ইসরায়েলি সেনাদের ওপর মর্টার হামলা চালিয়ে যানবাহন ধ্বংস করেছিল।  
      
    ইসরায়েলি দখলদার বাহিনীর নৃশংসতা যতই বাড়ছে, ফিলিস্তিনি জনগণের প্রতিরোধের চেতনা ততই শাণিত হচ্ছে। আল-কাসসাম ব্রিগেডসের ১৪ আগস্ট, বৃহস্পতিবারের সফল অপারেশন প্রমাণ করে যে, অন্যায়ের বিরুদ্ধে সংগ্রাম কখনই থামানো যায় না। ইসরায়েলের অভ্যন্তরে বেড়ে চলেছে হতাশা নেতৃত্বহীনতার অভিযোগ। যুদ্ধের সময় যত গড়াচ্ছে, ততই স্পষ্ট হয়ে উঠছে—যারা একদিন দখল নিতে এসেছিল, তারা আজ নিজেরাই দিশেহারা।

    **কিরগিজস্তানের সাথে যুগান্তকারী বাণিজ্য সহযোগিতা চুক্তি স্বাক্ষর করেছে ইমারতে ইসলামিয়া**
    
    ! <image:4223>
    
      
      
    দ্বিপক্ষীয় অর্থনৈতিক সম্পর্ক জোরদার করতে কিরগিজস্তানের সাথে একটি ব্যাপক অর্থনৈতিক পদক্ষেপ হাতে নিয়েছে ইমারতে ইসলামিয়া আফগানিস্তান। এই উদ্দেশ্যে একটি বিস্তারিত রোডম্যাপ প্রণয়ন ও সমঝোতা চুক্তি স্বাক্ষর করেছে উভয় পক্ষ। সম্প্রতি ইমারতে ইসলামিয়ার শিল্প ও বাণিজ্য মন্ত্রী নূরুদ্দিন আজিজি হাফিযাহুল্লাহ’র কিরগিজস্তান সফরকালে এই চুক্তি স্বাক্ষরিত হয়েছে।  
      
    এই সময় বাণিজ্য সম্পর্ক সম্প্রসারণ ও ব্যবসায় বাধা অপসারণ করতে কিরগিজ প্রতিনিধিদের সাথে ব্যাপক আলোচনা উপস্থাপিত হয়েছে।  
      
    এছাড়া যৌথ বাণিজ্য কাউন্সিল গঠন, নিয়মিত বৈঠক আয়োজন এবং অগ্রগতি পর্যবেক্ষণের জন্য একটি যৌথ ওয়ার্কিং গ্রুপ গঠনের বিষয়ে উক্ত সভায় আলোচনা হয়েছে।  
      
    ট্রেড হাউস ও বাণিজ্যিক কেন্দ্র চালু করা, অর্থনৈতিক ফোরাম, প্রদর্শনী এবং আফগানিস্তানে যৌথ বিনিয়োগ সম্প্রসারণের পরিকল্পনা উত্থাপিত হয়েছে।  
      
    দ্বিপাক্ষিক ট্রানজিট করিডোর, বাণিজ্য ও ট্রানজিট উন্নয়ন চুক্তি স্বাক্ষর এবং উজবেকিস্তান ও তাজিকিস্তানকে জড়িত করে ত্রিপক্ষীয় সহযোগিতায় কাজ করতে উভয়ে সম্মত হয়েছে।  
      
    নতুন এই চুক্তিতে কিরগিজ প্রশাসনের পক্ষ থেকে আফগান ব্যবসায়ীদের বাণিজ্যিক ভিসা, ব্যাংকিং সংযোগ ও পরিবহন রুট সহজতর করার প্রতিশ্রুতি রয়েছে।  
      
    আফগানিস্তান দক্ষিণ এশিয়া, মধ্য এশিয়া এবং মধ্য প্রাচ্যকে সংযোগকারী ট্রানজিট হাব হয়ে উঠার প্রবল সম্ভাবনা রয়েছে। তাই কৌশলগত অবস্থানকে কাজে লাগিয়ে মধ্য এশিয়ার রাষ্ট্রগুলোতে বাণিজ্য সম্প্রসারণ করছে ইমারতে ইসলামিয়া।  
      
    উক্ত সমঝোতা স্মারক দ্বিপক্ষীয় সম্পর্কের ক্ষেত্রে একটি উল্লেখযোগ্য মাইলফলক হিসেবে অভিহিত করেছেন উভয় পক্ষ। এর মাধ্যমে উভয় দেশের মধ্যে ব্যবসা বৃদ্ধি ও অর্থনৈতিক সংহতির পথ প্রশস্ত হবে বলে প্রত্যাশা করা হচ্ছে।

    **আমেরিকার প্রচারিত মানবাধিকার প্রতিবেদনে রাজনৈতিক সুর বিদ্যমান: জাবিহুল্লাহ মুজাহিদ হাফিযাহুল্লাহ**
    
    ! <image:4228>
    
      
      
    ইমারতে ইসলামিয়া আফগানিস্তানে যুক্তরাষ্ট্রের সরাসরি উপস্থিতি নেই, তারা আফগানিস্তান সম্পর্কে প্রত্যক্ষ জ্ঞানও রাখে না, তা সত্ত্বেও মানবাধিকার ইস্যুতে নিজেদের ইচ্ছে মতো মূল্যায়ন প্রকাশ করে যাচ্ছে ওয়াশিংটন। মার্কিন পররাষ্ট্র দপ্তরের মানবাধিকার বিষয়ক বার্ষিক প্রতিবেদনের প্রতিক্রিয়ায় এসব মন্তব্য করেন ইমারতে ইসলামিয়ার মুখপাত্র জাবিহুল্লাহ মুজাহিদ হাফিযাহুল্লাহ।  
      
    উক্ত মানবাধিকার প্রতিবেদনে দাবি করা হয়, তালিবান সরকারের অধীনে আফগানিস্তানে মানবাধিকার সুরক্ষা উল্লেখযোগ্যভাবে হ্রাস পেয়েছে। নারী অধিকার ও মত প্রকাশের স্বাধীনতা লঙ্ঘিত হয়েছে।  
      
    জবাবে মুজাহিদ হাফিযাহুল্লাহ বলেন, আফগানিস্তানে কোনও মার্কিন দূতাবাস নেই। তাই তাদের পক্ষে আফগানিস্তানের বাস্তবতা, অগ্রগতি বা মানবাধিকারের বিষয়গুলো পর্যবেক্ষণ করা চলে না। এই প্রতিবেদনগুলোর সাথে রাজনৈতিক উদ্দেশ্য জড়িত, অধিকাংশ প্রতিবেদন ষড়যন্ত্রের হাতিয়ার হিসেবে প্রকাশ করা হয়ে থাকে।  
      
    তিনি জোর দিয়ে বলেন, যুক্তরাষ্ট্রের উচিত মার্কিন দখলদারিত্বের সময়ের সাথে আফগানিস্তানের বর্তমান পরিস্থিতি তুলনা করা, মানবাধিকার সুরক্ষার ক্ষেত্রে কোন সময়কালটি অধিক উত্তম সেটা তারা অনুধাবন করুক।  
      
    তিনি আরও বলেন, আফগান ইস্যু নিয়ে আমেরিকার উদ্বিগ্ন হওয়া উচিত নয়, কেননা নাগরিকদের অধিকার সম্পর্কে বর্তমান সরকার অবগত আছে। আফগানিস্তানের একটি একটি ধর্মীয় ও আইনি দৃষ্টিভঙ্গি রয়েছে, নাগরিকদের অধিকার নিশ্চিত করতে এখানে ধর্মীয় বাধ্যবাধকতা রয়েছে।

    **ইমারতে ইসলামিয়ার চার বছরের অর্জন: সামরিক ও রাজনৈতিক দু’ক্ষেত্রেই বিজয়**
    
    ! <image:4231>
    
      
      
      
    আফগানিস্তানে ইমারতে ইসলামিয়ার শাসন পুনঃপ্রতিষ্ঠার চার বছর পূর্ণ হতে চলেছে। এ উপলক্ষে ইমারতে ইসলামিয়ার কর্মকর্তারা সামরিক ও রাজনৈতিক ক্ষেত্রে নিজেদের অর্জনের ওপর আলোকপাত করেছেন।  
      
    গত ১৩ আগস্ট কাতারে অবস্থিত ইমারতে ইসলামিয়ার দূতাবাসের ভারপ্রাপ্ত প্রধান সুহাইল শাহিন হাফিযাহুল্লাহ জানান, ইমারতে ইসলামিয়ার বিজয় অর্জনের ফলে শত্রুদের রাজনৈতিক ও কৌশলগত পরিকল্পনা ব্যর্থ হয়েছে এবং দেশের প্রশাসনিক কাঠামো আরও মজবুত হয়েছে।  
      
    তিনি বলেন, ‘এই বিজয়ের গুরুত্বপূর্ণ দিক হলো ইমারতে ইসলামিয়া শুধু সামরিক নয়, রাজনৈতিক ক্ষেত্রেও সফলতা অর্জন করেছে। এই উদ্যোগ আফগানিস্তানে ইসলামি শাসন প্রতিষ্ঠার পথকে সুগম করেছে।’  
      
    তিনি আরও বলেন, ইমারতে ইসলামিয়ার সদস্যদের প্রচেষ্টা ও আফগান জনগণের ত্যাগের কারণে বিশ্ব শক্তি ও তাদের মিত্ররা পরাজিত হয়েছে।  
      
    এর আগে, ইমারতে ইসলামিয়ার জ্যেষ্ঠ নেতা আনাস হাক্কানি হাফিযাহুল্লাহ দোহা চুক্তিকে আফগানিস্তানে আমেরিকার পরাজয়ের লিখিত স্বীকৃতি হিসেবে বর্ণনা করেন। তিনি বলেন, চুক্তির মাধ্যমে আমেরিকা ক্ষমতা হস্তান্তর করতে বাধ্য হয়েছিল, যদিও শুরুতে তারা আলোচনা এড়িয়ে গিয়েছিল। হাক্কানি জানান, তালিবান পারস্পরিক সমঝোতার মাধ্যমে ক্ষমতায় আসতে চাইলেও সাবেক প্রেসিডেন্ট আশরাফ ঘানির হঠাৎ পলায়ন সেই পরিকল্পনায় পরিবর্তন আনে।

Always adhere to the following rules:
* Write only one to two paragraphs.
* Include all URLs from the listed sources. Format them as Markdown hyperlinks.
* Do not add any additional information besides the information in the summaries.
* Include references (<image:k>) to all relevant images.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:34> This image shows an Israeli tank unit near Jabalia camp in northern Gaza that was successfully ambushed by Hamas fighters, destroying multiple vehicles and injuring or killing their crews in October 2024."

## Actions
```
web_search("Israeli tank Jabalia camp Hamas ambush October 2024")
image_search("Israeli tank destroyed Jabalia Gaza")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Al Jazeera reported on an Israeli ground offensive on Jabalia on October 6, 2024, resulting in at least 17 deaths, with tank deployment and evacuation orders (<image:1>). The Palestinian Islamic Jihad targeted an Israeli command and control room in Jabalia. The Guardian discussed the destruction of the Jabaliya refugee camp in Gaza by Israeli forces, with the third offensive starting on October 5, 2024, and included satellite images and videos showing the destruction of buildings and infrastructure in the camp (<image:1>, <image:2>, <image:3>, <image:4>, <image:5>, <image:6>).

Wikipedia discusses the Siege of North Gaza, which took place from October 5, 2024, to January 19, 2025, as part of the Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip. The article mentions the involvement of Israeli forces and Hamas fighters in Jabalia, Beit Lahia, and Beit Hanoun. On October 10, Hamas organized an ambush which destroyed an IDF mechanized infantry company of 12 vehicles east of the Jabalia camp.


### Evidence from `image_search`
Al Jazeera reports on battles in northern Gaza, mentioning Palestinian fighters ambushing Israeli troops (<image:6423>). PBS NewsHour published an article about Israeli airstrikes in the Jabalia refugee camp in Gaza (<image:6424>). The BBC News website contains an image of an Israeli tank (<image:6425>).

The provided sources do not confirm the claim that the image shows an Israeli tank unit near Jabalia camp that was successfully ambushed by Hamas fighters in October 2024.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that there was an Israeli ground offensive on Jabalia in October 2024, and that Hamas fighters were active in the area. Specifically, Wikipedia mentions an ambush by Hamas on October 10, 2024, which destroyed an IDF mechanized infantry company east of the Jabalia camp. However, the evidence does not directly link the image to this specific event.

Therefore, while the claim's context is supported by the evidence, the image's specific association with the ambush cannot be verified. More information is needed to confirm the image's origin and the circumstances of the tank's destruction.

However, the image's specific association with the ambush could not be verified. The reverse image search revealed that the image of the burning tank was used in articles discussing the 2023 Hamas attacks on Israel and an attack by Al-Qassam Brigades in Khan Yunis. This indicates that the image is not from October 2024, and therefore the claim is false. `false`

Wikipedia discusses the Siege of North Gaza, which took place from October 5, 2024, to January 19, 2025, as part of the Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip. The article mentions the involvement of Israeli forces and Hamas fighters in Jabalia, Beit Lahia, and Beit Hanoun. On October 10, Hamas organized an ambush which destroyed an IDF mechanized infantry company of 12 vehicles east of the Jabalia camp.


### Evidence from `image_search`
Al Jazeera reports on battles in northern Gaza, mentioning Palestinian fighters ambushing Israeli troops (<image:6423>). PBS NewsHour published an article about Israeli airstrikes in the Jabalia refugee camp in Gaza (<image:6424>). The BBC News website contains an image of an Israeli tank (<image:6425>).

The provided sources do not confirm the claim that the image shows an Israeli tank unit near Jabalia camp that was successfully ambushed by Hamas fighters in October 2024.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that there was an Israeli ground offensive on Jabalia in October 2024, and that Hamas fighters were active in the area. Specifically, Wikipedia mentions an ambush by Hamas on October 10, 2024, which destroyed an IDF mechanized infantry company east of the Jabalia camp. However, the evidence does not directly link the image to this specific event.

Therefore, while the claim's context is supported by the evidence, the image's specific association with the ambush cannot be verified. More information is needed to confirm the image's origin and the circumstances of the tank's destruction.


## Actions

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image of the burning tank (<image:34>) appears in articles discussing the 2023 Hamas attacks on Israel, including a 9jaflaver.com article from October 7, 2023, and a Nairaland forum thread from the same date. Another source, dawahilallah.com, published on August 14, 2025, uses the image to illustrate an attack by Al-Qassam Brigades in Khan Yunis.


## Elaboration
The reverse image search reveals that the image of the burning tank (<image:34>

## Final Judgement
The initial search confirmed that there was an Israeli ground offensive on Jabalia in October 2024, and that Hamas fighters were active in the area. However, the image's specific association with the ambush could not be verified. The reverse image search revealed that the image of the burning tank was used in articles discussing the 2023 Hamas attacks on Israel and an attack by Al-Qassam Brigades in Khan Yunis. This indicates that the image is not from October 2024, and therefore the claim is false. `false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is false. While there was an Israeli ground offensive in Jabalia in October 2024, and Hamas fighters were active in the area, a reverse image search of the provided image revealed that it was used in articles discussing the 2023 Hamas attacks on Israel and an attack by Al-Qassam Brigades in Khan Yunis, indicating the image is not from October 2024.

*   Summary

*   Israeli tanks enter Ebad-Alrahman in Gaza City, shell houses, residents flee
*   Church leaders in Gaza City refuse to evacuate amid conflict
*   Trump to chair meeting on Gaza, aims for resolution by year-end

CAIRO, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Israeli tanks pushed into a new area on the edge of Gaza City overnight, destroying houses and prompting residents to flee, witnesses said, ahead of an expected meeting [on the war](https://www.reuters.com/world/israel-hamas/)
 to be chaired by U.S. [President Donald Trump](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/donald-trump/)
 on Wednesday.

Tanks late on Tuesday entered into the Ebad-Alrahman neighbourhood on the northern edge of Gaza City and shelled houses, wounding several people and forcing many others, who had been taken by surprise, to move deeper into Gaza's largest city, residents said.

"All of a sudden, we heard that the tanks pushed into Ebad-Alrahman, the sounds of explosions became louder, and louder, and we saw people escaping towards our area," said Saad Abed, 60, a former construction worker.

"If no truce is reached, we will see the tanks outside our homes," he told Reuters via a chat app from his house in Jala Street in Gaza City, around one kilometre (0.6 mile) from the Ebad-Alrahman neighbourhood.

Israel has said it is preparing to launch a [new offensive](/world/middle-east/netanyahu-says-new-gaza-offensive-will-start-soon-2025-08-10/)
 in Gaza City, which it describes as Hamas' last bastion. It was unclear who would be present at the Trump meeting.

TANKS PULL BACK, BOMBARDMENTS CONTINUE
--------------------------------------

Israeli tanks retreated from the edge of Gaza City later on Wednesday to the Jabalia area, where they have been operating for months, although bombardments on three of the city's eastern suburbs - Shejaia, Zeitoun and Sabra - continued.

Gaza health authorities said Israeli fire had killed at least 20 people, including a four-year-old girl, across the enclave.

The Israeli military said in a statement that its forces were operating in Jabalia and the outskirts of Gaza City to "dismantle terror infrastructure sites and eliminate terrorists".

It said it had killed a senior Hamas militant, Mahmoud Al-Aswad, who served as the group's head of general security intelligence for the West Gaza area, on August 22. Around half of the enclave's two million people are currently living there and Israel has said they will be told to evacuate.

Thousands have already left, but church leaders in the city said on Wednesday they were staying put, as leaving Gaza City and "trying to flee to the south would be nothing less than a death sentence".

"For this reason, the clergy and nuns have decided to remain and continue to care for all those who will be in the compounds," a joint statement by the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate and the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem said.

In a statement on Wednesday, the Israeli military's Arabic spokesperson Avichay Adraee said "evacuating Gaza City is inevitable" and Israel had begun facilitating the entry of tents into the enclave.

"Before transitioning to the next phase in the war, I wish to confirm that there are vast empty areas in the southern Strip, just as is the case in the central camps and in Al-Mawasi. special envoy Steve Witkoff said on Tuesday that Trump would [chair a meeting](/world/middle-east/trump-chair-gaza-meeting-washington-top-us-israeli-diplomats-also-meet-2025-08-26/)
 on Gaza at the White House on Wednesday and added that Washington expected Israel's war in the Palestinian territory to be settled by the end of the year.

The U.S. Thousands of [Israelis rallied](/world/middle-east/israelis-rally-against-gaza-war-former-hostage-longs-her-friends-be-freed-2025-08-26/)
 across the country on Tuesday demanding an end to the conflict and the release of hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza.

Israel has yet to publicly respond to the latest 60-day U.S.-backed ceasefire proposal, which it had previously accepted and which Hamas last week agreed to.

The war was triggered on October 7, 2023, when Hamas-led fighters stormed into Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages, Israeli tallies show.

Israel's subsequent military campaign against Hamas has killed more than 62,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health authorities. Israel disputes fatality figures by the health ministry in the Hamas-run strip.

Residents of Deir al-Balah have been fleeing southern areas of Deir al-Balah in response to Israeli military orders

Israeli tanks have advanced into Deir al-Balah in central Gaza for the first time, triggering a fresh wave of displacement among civilians.

Local journalists said tanks entered southern and eastern areas of the city on Monday amid heavy air and artillery strikes, a day after Israel ordered residents in several areas to leave.

Deir al-Balah is one of the few areas of Gaza where Israel has not conducted a major ground operation during its 21-month war with Hamas.

The UK and 24 other nations meanwhile condemned the killing of hundreds of Palestinians at food aid points. "The suffering of civilians has reached new depths."

The UN said the evacuation order in Deir al-Balah affected tens of thousands of Palestinians and dealt "another devastating blow" to humanitarian efforts.

The neighbourhoods contain dozens of camps for displaced families as well as aid warehouses, health clinics, and critical water infrastructure.

Local journalists told the BBC that Israeli tanks and other military vehicles pushed into eastern Deir al-Balah on Monday from the direction of the Kissufim crossing and under the cover of heavy artillery and air strikes.

Dozens of shells struck the Abu al-Ajin and Hikr al-Jami areas, they said.

Night-time footage shared on social media showed explosions and the sound of gunfire. <image:6595>!A BBC map titled "Israeli evacuation or 'no go' zones across Gaza". The map shows four Israeli military corridors which cut across Gaza, and is shaded to show how almost all of the territory has been under evacuation orders. At least 20 of the 50 hostages still in captivity are believed to be still alive.

Hostages' families have expressed concern that an offensive could endanger them.

"Can anyone \[promise\] to us that this decision will not come at the cost of losing our loved ones?" they said on Sunday.

According to the UN, about 87.8% of Gaza is now covered by Israeli evacuation orders or is within Israeli militarized zones, leaving the 2.1 million population squeezed into about 46 sq km of land where essential services have collapsed.

Meanwhile, the World Food Programme warned Gaza's hunger crisis had "reached new levels of desperation" after more than 100 people were reportedly killed while waiting for food over the weekend.

On Sunday, at least 67 people were killed as they surged toward a convoy of WFP aid lorries near the Zikim crossing point in northern Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Nearly one person in three is not eating for days," the WFP said.

"Only a massive scale-up in food aid distributions can stabilise this spiralling situation."

In their joint statement, the group of 25 nations including European countries, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Japan condemned what they said was the "drip feeding of aid and the inhumane killing of civilians, including children".

"It is horrifying that over 800 Palestinians have been killed while seeking aid."

It condemned Hamas's refusal to release all its hostages, and said a "negotiated ceasefire offers the best hope of bringing them home".

The Israeli foreign ministry said on Sunday that 4,400 lorry loads of humanitarian aid had entered Gaza from Israel since mid-May, when it partially eased a total blockade on deliveries that lasted 11 weeks. Another 700 lorry loads were waiting to be picked up by the UN from the Gaza side of its crossing points, it added.

Israel launched its war in Gaza in retaliation for the Hamas-led attacks on 7 October 2023, which killed about 1,200 people and led to 251 others being taken hostage.

Israeli attacks have since killed at least 58,895 people in Gaza, according to the territory's health ministry.

بعد فيديوهات احتراقها.. كيف تم تدمير "ميركافا" الإسرائيلية؟

أثار احتراق الدبابة الإسرائيلية ميركافا، الملقبة بـ"المركبة الحربية"، من قبل مقاتلي حركة حماس، خلال عملية " طوفان الأقصى"، تساؤلات عن مدى قوة الدبابة التي تعتبرها إسرائيل الأقوى في العالم وفخر صناعاتها الحربية  
  
ومنذ يوم السبت الماضي، وفي أعقاب تنفيذ حماس عمليتها العسكرية التي طالت 11 معسكرا إسرائيليا و20 مستوطنة في غلاف غزة، انتشرت مقاطع فيديو، تظهر تلك الدبابة التي يبلغ سعرها حوالي 7 ملايين دولار وتعد الأكثر تحصينا في العالم والأقوى في أرض المعارك، وفق تقارير عسكرية، تشتعل بها النيران بعد إلقاء ذخائر قديمة من طائرة عمودية بجوارها، كما اندفعت النيران من باب في مؤخرة الدبابة إلى مسافة ما لا يقل عن 10 أمتار، ولم ينج إلا فرد واحد من طاقمها  
  

وما يسلط الضوء على تلك الدبابة أيضا، فوفق تقديرات خبراء لموقع "سكاي نيوز عربية"، فإن تلك الدبابة، ومع ما يتم تداوله حول إعداد الجيش الإسرائيلي لعملية اجتياح بري لقطاع غزة، ستكون بجميع نسخها خصوصا النسخة الأحدث الملقبة بـ"باراك" والتي دخلت الخدمة عام 2023، في مقدمة العتاد العسكري الإسرائيلي المشارك في هذا الاجتياح  
  
ما نقاط القوة في ميركافا؟  
  
جاءت ميركافا التي بدأت إسرائيل صناعتها في 1983، في 4 نسخ متتالية: "ميركافا 1" ، و"ميركافا "2 و"ميركافا 3" و"ميركافا 4"، كما بدأت تطويرها في أوائل التسعينيات، وأنتج الطراز الرابع منها في 2002، وسُلّم أول إنتاج فعلي منها للجيش الإسرائيلي في 2004، وتم استخدامها في الانتفاضة الثانية وحرب لبنان 2006 وحرب غزة 2008-2009  
  
وتقول مجلة "ناشيونال إنترست" العسكرية، إن الدبابة الإسرائيلية تعد دبابة القتال الرئيسية للجيش الإسرائيلي، حيث سعت تل أبيب خلال السنوات الماضية لتصبح ميركافا واحدة من أفضل دبابات القتال الرئيسية في العالم  
  
ووفق تقارير عسكرية فإن إسرائيل ترى سلاح الدبابات من أهم الأسلحة الحربية في المواجهات البرية، وبسبب ذلك حرصت على تصميم أحدث النماذج ووضعته في "ميركافا 4 " أو "دبابة باراك " وأطلقت عليها لقب "دبابة القرن 21"، وقدرت تكلفتها حوالي 6 ملايين دولار أميركي لكل دبابة، وضمن نقاط القوة التي تتميز بها النسخ المعززة من تلك الدبابة، ما يلي:  
  
منظومات دفاعية ومنظومات لاكتشاف التهديدات بجانب نظام "أوفيك" المتطور للاتصالات الذي يجعل الطاقم مستفيدا من مختلف منظومات الرصد الأخرى من الجو والبحر  
  
منظومة كشف الأشعة السينية لاكتشاف أفراد المشاة داخل المنشآت  
  
تتميز بأنها أول دبابة في العالم تحتوي على نظام متقدم من الذكاء الاصطناعي يدير مهام الخزان، مما يقلل عبء العمل على الطاقم ويساعد في تحديد الأهداف بدقة كبيرة، ودُمج نظام الذكاء الاصطناعي بنظام إدارة ساحة المعركة  
  
الوزن: يصل وزن "ميركافا 4" حوالي 62 طنا  
  
القوة: 1500 حصان  
  
ناقل الحركة : آلي 5 سرعات من الجيل الثاني المتقدم جدا  
  
تمتلك مدفعاً رئيسياً عيار 105 ملم مزود بـ 62 قذيفة وهو ما يعني قدرة الدبابة على مواصلة القتال لفترات طويلة حتى عندما تكون موجودة في ساحة قتال تعاني نقص إمدادات الذخيرة  
  
يتم ربط المدفع الرئيسي بمدفع رشاش دوار عيار 7.62 ملم، إضافة إلى مدفع إضافي من ذات العيار أو.....

# Instructions
You just retrieved new Evidence. Now, **analyze the Claim's veracity using the evidence**. Always adhere to the following rules:
* Focus on developing new insights. Do not repeat larger parts from the Record. Do not restate the Claim.
* Write down your thoughts step-by-step. Whenever necessary, you may elaborate in more detail.
* Depending on the topic's complexity, invest one to three paragraphs. The fewer, the better.
* If you find that there is insufficient information to verify the Claim, explicitly state what information is missing.
* If you cite web sources, always refer to them by including their URL as a Markdown hyperlink.
* **Use information only from the recorded evidence**: Avoid inserting information that is not implied by the evidence. You may use commonsense knowledge, though.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:36> This image shows a Palestinian woman using an Israeli tank to dry clothes in Gaza in July 2024."

## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:36>)
web_search("Israeli tank Gaza")
reverse_search(<image:36>)
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.29, 'Tunisia': 0.26, 'Jordan': 0.19, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.09, 'Israel': 0.07, 'Pakistan': 0.04, 'China': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0}

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Reuters article from August 27, 2025, discusses Israeli tanks on the border with Gaza and an upcoming meeting chaired by U.S. President Donald Trump regarding the war in Gaza ([https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-tanks-close-gaza-city-trump-chair-meeting-2025-08-27/](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-tanks-close-gaza-city-trump-chair-meeting-2025-08-27/)). The Wikipedia article discusses the Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip, which began on October 28, 2023, and mentions the use of tanks and armored vehicles ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_invasion_of_the_Gaza_Strip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_invasion_of_the_Gaza_Strip)).

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image is likely taken in Palestine, according to the geolocation analysis. The reverse image search indicates that the image was published on October 11, 2023, by Sky News Arabia, which discusses the destruction of an Israeli Merkava tank. The claim states the image was taken in July 2024, which is inconsistent with the reverse image search results. Therefore, the claim is likely false.

Israel’s air-defense system passes test in fending off Iranian missile strike
=============================================================================

[World](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world)
 Oct 2, 2024 1:49 PM EDT

JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel’s multilayered air-defense system appears to have passed another test after fending off Iran’s latest missile barrage.

In Tuesday’s night’s strike, Iran fired over 180 missiles toward Israel. According to Israeli media reports, the cost of a single Iron Dome interception is about $50,000, while the other systems can run more than $2 million per missile. It has been deployed on multiple occasions throughout the war.

### Iron Dome

This system, developed by Israel with U.S. Israel says it has a success rate of over 90%.

### Iron Beam

Israel is developing a new system to intercept incoming threats with laser technology. They have ranged from short-range rockets to medium-range missiles to attack drones to long-range ballistic missiles like those fired Tuesday night.

**WATCH:** [Middle East again on edge after largest aerial attack ever launched against Israel](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/middle-east-again-on-edge-after-largest-aerial-attack-ever-launched-against-israel)

In Tuesday’s attack, the U.S. Explosions also were seen over the skies of Jordan, though it remains unclear who carried out the interceptions.

But the vast majority of Israel’s air defense over the past year has been carried out by Israel itself. Israeli leaders say the system isn’t 100% guaranteed, but credit it with preventing serious damage and countless casualties.

Iranian missile strikes show Israel’s aerial defense array is not ironclad
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

1 of 3 | 

Air raid sirens sounded across Israel on Friday night as Iranian missiles were launched towards the country. assistance, has developed a tiered system capable of detecting incoming fire and deploying only if the projectile is headed toward a population center or sensitive military or civilian infrastructure while letting other projectiles land in open spaces.

The array can shoot down short-range rockets to medium-range missiles to attack drones to ballistic missiles like those Iran has been firing.

But the military warns the system is not fool proof and while interception rates are generally high, enemy missiles can penetrate. Israel has said this system will be a game changer because it would be much cheaper to operate than existing systems.

According to Israeli media reports, the cost of a single Iron Dome interception is about $50,000, while the other systems can run more than $2 million per missile. Supreme Court](https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court)

**IN SOUTHERN GAZA,** just outside Rafah, lies Mirage—once known as the vegetable basket of Gaza. Then the tanks rolled in, trampling the land to ensure that it would no longer be suitable for agriculture. 

Since March 2, 2025, almost no food or aid has entered Gaza, and people cannot find anything to eat. “Not because there’s no sun—but because there’s no reason to water what’s no longer alive.” 

The Israeli assault on Mirage came not only with bulldozers grinding through the earth and drones buzzing menacingly overhead, but with the brutal understanding that destroying Gaza’s ability to feed itself sentences it to a slow death.

Gaza farmer grows vegetables in tent city to ‘survive another day’
==================================================================

Only 1.5% of Gaza farmland usable: FAO • Famine in Gaza heightens global concern: UN

August 10, 2025 07:31 p.m

**GAZA CITY:** With food scarce and aid hard and sometimes deadly to come by, Gaza farmer Ibrahim Abu Jabal is growing vegetables in the harsh conditions of a sprawling displacement camp to sustain his family. Abu Jabal, 39, has turned a small patch of soil near the family’s tent in Gaza City into a vegetable garden, where he tends to rows of tomatoes, cucumbers and peppers, surrounded by tens of thousands of other Palestinians displaced by the Zionist entity war. There are no tomatoes, and even if there were, we wouldn’t have the money to buy them.” The displaced farmer has cultivated the sandy plot of 120 square meters (about 1,300 square feet), using seeds from dried vegetables and relying on an erratic water supply.

“Due to the situation we’re going through... and the soaring prices of vegetables, I had to return to my old profession,” said Abu Jabal. He said he had prepared the plot “so I can start planting again, just so my children and I can survive another day, or a little longer.”

Water in Gaza, much like food, is in precariously low supply, and to keep his garden green, Abu Jalal usually has to carry large jugs he fills from a nearby pipe where water flows only one hour a day. Zionist entity is under growing pressure to bring an end to the war in Gaza, where UN warnings that famine was unfolding have heightened global concern for the territory’s more than two million Palestinian inhabitants living through a humanitarian crisis.

The Zionist offensive has killed at least 61,258 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to figures from the health ministry, which are considered reliable by the United Nations. Zionist entity in late May began easing a complete aid blockade that had lasted more than two months, but only a trickle of food and other basic supplies has entered Gaza since then. Before the war, agriculture accounted for around 10 percent of the Gaza Strip’s economy, with about a quarter of the population at least partially supported by agriculture and fishing.

But on Wednesday the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization said that just 1.5 percent of the territory’s farmland remained accessible and undamaged, citing the latest satellite data. Hungry Gazans have increasingly been forced to brave chaotic scenes at a handful of distribution points managed by the Zionists and US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.

On July 22, the UN rights office said Zionist forces had killed more than 1,000 Palestinians trying to get food aid in Gaza since the GHF started operations in May—nearly three-quarters of them in the vicinity of GHF sites. Referring to the GHF operation, he said that “the American aid does not satisfy people’s hunger.” “For someone who has nine children like me, what can a single box of aid really do?”

Only 1.5 percent of Gaza’s farmland is accessible and undamaged—less than a square mile—according to the latest satellite survey published Wednesday by the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization, which warned the Palestinian territory was on “the brink of a full-scale famine”."

Gaza farmer grows vegetables in tent city to 'survive another day'

Abu Jabal, 39, has turned a small patch of soil near the family's tent in Gaza City into a vegetable garden, where he tends to rows of tomatoes, cucumbers and peppers, surrounded by tens of thousands of other Palestinians displaced by the Israel-Hamas war.

"Our bodies need tomatoes, cucumbers," he told AFP.

"And these products are expensive here. and the soaring prices of vegetables, I had to return to my old profession," said Abu Jabal.

Water in Gaza, much like food, is in precariously low supply, and to keep his garden green, Abu Jalal usually has to carry large jugs he fills from a nearby pipe where water flows only one hour a day.

Israel is under growing pressure to bring an end to the war in Gaza, where UN warnings that famine was unfolding have heightened global concern for the territory's more than two million Palestinian inhabitants living through a humanitarian crisis.

Aid access 'blocked'
--------------------

The Israeli offensive, triggered by Palestinian militant group Hamas's October 2023 attack on Israel, has killed at least 61,258 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, which are considered reliable by the United Nations.

The Hamas attack that sparked the war resulted in the deaths of 1,219 people, the majority of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.

Israel in late May began easing a complete aid blockade that had lasted more than two months, but only a trickle of food and other basic supplies has entered Gaza since then.

Before the war, agriculture accounted for around 10 percent of the Gaza Strip's economy, with about a quarter of the population at least partially supported by agriculture and fishing.

But on Wednesday the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization said that just 1.5 percent of the territory's farmland remained accessible and undamaged, citing the latest satellite data.

"People are starving not because food is unavailable, but because access is blocked, local agrifood systems have collapsed, and families can no longer sustain even the most basic livelihoods," the agency's Director-General Qu Dongyu said.

Hungry Gazans have increasingly been forced to brave chaotic scenes at a handful of distribution points managed by the Israel- and US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.

On July 22, the UN rights office said Israeli forces had killed more than 1,000 Palestinians trying to get food aid in Gaza since the GHF started operations in May -- nearly three-quarters of them in the vicinity of GHF sites.

Abu Jabal said his nine-year-old daughter had been injured near a charity kitchen.

Referring to the GHF operation, he said that "the American aid does not satisfy people's hunger."

"For someone who has nine children like me, what can a single box of aid really do?"

In Syria, a tank abandoned by regime forces became a fruit and vegetable stand.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On November 27, clashes intensified between regime-opposing armed groups and Bashar al-Assad's forces in Syria. The groups had gained dominance in the largest provinces such as Aleppo, Idlib, Hama, and Homs between November 30 and December 7. As the groups began to enter the capital Damascus on December 7, with support from the masses, the regime completely lost control in Damascus and many other regions, leading to its collapse. The 61-year rule of the Ba'ath Party came to an end, and regime leader Assad fled the capital.

* Write down your thoughts step-by-step. Whenever necessary, you may elaborate in more detail.
* Depending on the topic's complexity, invest one to three paragraphs. The fewer, the better.
* If you find that there is insufficient information to verify the Claim, explicitly state what information is missing.

## Claim
Claim: "<image:43> This image shows a vegetable stand in Gaza in January 2025 with a Merkava tank, the pride of the Israeli army, as its decor."

## Actions

reverse_search(<image:43>)
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Turkey': 0.26, 'Ukraine': 0.13, 'Palestine': 0.11, 'Russia': 0.11, 'Tunisia': 0.07, 'Bulgaria': 0.06, 'Kyrgyzstan': 0.02, 'Macedonia': 0.02, 'Pakistan': 0.02, 'Albania': 0.01}

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Washington Report on Middle East Affairs published an article on June 22, 2025, discussing the destruction of farmland in Gaza and the lack of food and aid since March 2, 2025. The article includes a photograph of vegetables from the market in January 2025 (<image:abu-sitta01x730>). The Kuwait Times published an article on August 10, 2025, about a Gaza farmer growing vegetables in a displacement camp due to food scarcity and high prices (<image:6617>). France 24 published an article on August 7, 2025, about a Gaza farmer growing vegetables in a displacement camp to feed his family (<image:i>).


### Evidence from `reverse_search`
From [Source](https://en.haberler.com/in-syria-an-abandoned-tank-has-become-a-fruit-and-2027395/): Found exact image on website with title: In Syria, an abandoned tank has become a fruit and vegetable stand.
Content: The search result is from a Turkish news website and shows an image of a tank being used as a fruit and vegetable stand. The article states that the tank was abandoned by regime forces in Syria and the image was taken on December 15, 2024. <image:2101>


# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image depicts a vegetable stand using a tank as a display. The reverse image search indicates the photo was taken in Syria on December 15, 2024, and not in Gaza in January 2025. The tank is also not identified as a Merkava tank, which is the pride of the Israeli army.

The geolocation data suggests Palestine as a possible location, but the reverse image search contradicts the claim's location and date.

Therefore, the claim is false.

Content: The search result is from a Turkish news website and shows an image of a tank being used as a fruit and vegetable stand. The article states that the tank was abandoned by regime forces in Syria and the image was taken on December 15, 2024. <image:2101>


## Elaboration
The image depicts a vegetable stand using a tank as a display. The reverse image search indicates the photo was taken in Syria on December 15, 2024, and not in Gaza in January 2025. The tank is also not identified as a Merkava tank, which is the pride of the Israeli army.

The geolocation data suggests Palestine as a possible location, but the reverse image search contradicts the claim's location and date.

Therefore, the claim is false.


## Final Judgement
The image shows a vegetable stand using a tank as a display. However, the reverse image search indicates the photo was taken in Syria on December 15, 2024, not in Gaza in January 2025. The tank is also not identified as a Merkava tank.

`false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image depicts a vegetable stand using a tank as a display. However, a reverse image search reveals that the photo was taken in Syria on December 15, 2024, not in Gaza in January 2025, as claimed. The tank is also not identified as a Merkava tank.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \[Debbie Hill/AP\]

Published On 9 Jan 20259 Jan 2025

The Polish government has adopted a resolution promising that senior Israeli officials – including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu – can freely travel to Poland for the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp later this month.

Netanyahu faces an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for alleged war crimes in Israel’s war on Gaza.

“The Polish government treats the safe participation of the leaders of Israel in the commemorations on January 27, 2025, as part of paying tribute to the Jewish nation, millions of whose daughters and sons became victims of the Holocaust carried out by the Third Reich,” read the resolution, published by the office of Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk on Thursday.

Tusk told reporters that “whether it is the prime minister, the president or the minister – as it is currently declared – of education of Israel, whoever will come to Oswiecim for the celebrations in Auschwitz will be assured of safety and will not be detained.”

In November, the ICC issued [arrest warrants](/news/2024/11/21/netanyahu-gallant-issued-icc-arrest-warrants-for-war-crimes-whats-next)
 for Netanyahu and his ex-defence minister Yoav Gallant, as well as Hamas commander Ibrahim a-Masri, also known as Mohammed Deif, on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity.

Israel has condemned the warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant, saying that it has acted in self-defence triggered by Hamas’s [7 October 2023 attack](/news/2023/10/7/what-happened-in-israel-a-breakdown-of-how-the-hamas-attack-unfolded)
 on Israel.

As a member state of the ICC, Poland is required to detain suspects facing arrest warrants if they set foot on their soil, but the court has no way to enforce that. Israel is not a member of the ICC and disputes its jurisdiction.

Unclear if Netanyahu will attend
--------------------------------

On Wednesday, Bloomberg reported that Poland’s President Andrzej Duda wrote to Tusk asking that Netanyahu be allowed to attend the commemoration “unhindered”, given the event’s exceptional nature.

Malgorzata Paprocka, the head of Duda’s office, confirmed to state news agency PAP on Thursday that a letter had been sent.

“In the opinion of the president, there is one issue – precisely because it is the Auschwitz camp, every person from Israel, every representative of the authorities of this country should have the opportunity to take part in this exceptional event,” she said.

Prime Minister Tusk, who signed the resolution, said he had received information from the Israeli embassy that the country would be represented by its education minister.

Netanyahu has not said whether he would attend the Auschwitz commemoration. He has attended previous anniversary events at Auschwitz.

Over 1.1 million people, mostly Jews, died in gas chambers or from starvation, cold and disease at Auschwitz, which Nazi Germany set up in occupied Poland during World War II.

WARSAW — Poland’s President Andrzej Duda is asking the country’s government to ensure that [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2024-11-21/benjamin-netanyahu-hamas-international-criminal-court-arrest-warrants)
 can attend observances marking the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz later this month without the risk of being arrested, a Polish presidential aide said Thursday.

Netanyahu became an internationally wanted suspect after the International Criminal Court, the world’s top war crimes court, issued an arrest warrant for him and others in connection with the 15-month war in Gaza, accusing them of crimes against humanity.

There have been reports suggesting that the warrant could prevent Netanyahu from traveling to Poland to attend observances marking the anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp by Soviet forces on Jan.

Member countries of the ICC, including Poland, are required to detain suspects facing a warrant if they set foot on their soil, but the court has no way to enforce that. 18, 2024. The Polish Foreign Ministry, in response to an email query, said Thursday that “it has not received any information so far indicating that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is going to attend the celebration of the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz.”

“Poland is a safe country and any leader visiting Poland is entitled to protection granted by the Ministry of the Interior,” it added. The ministry also suggested that any idea that Netanyahu could be arrested in Poland is “fake news” that spread in U.S. Historians say that most of them, about a million, were Jewish, but the victims also included Poles, Roma, Soviet prisoners of war, and others.

Duda has asked the government of Prime Minister Donald Tusk to provide Netanyahu with protection from arrest, according to a top Duda aide, Malgorzata Paprocka, according to a report from PAP, the Polish state news agency.

Paprocka said that every Israeli state official and citizen should have the right to take part in the anniversary commemorations, and noted that “all instruments” related to ensuring Netanyahu’s stay in Poland are in the hands of Tusk’s government.

Bloomberg News first reported that Duda sent the request to Tusk by letter.

Paprocka said Duda’s office was still awaiting a reply.

According to Gaza's Health Ministry, more than 47,000 people have been killed in Israel's military incursion into the enclave, a response to the Hamas attacks on southern Israel on October 7, 2023, that killed some 1,200 people.

Israel is not a member of the ICC, but Poland is a founding member and legally bound to execute the warrant.

Safe conduct for Israeli PM
---------------------------

Citing "absolutely extraordinary circumstances," Polish President Andrzej Duda on January 9 asked [Donald Tusk](/en/donald-tusk/t-38238452)
 and his government to guarantee safe conduct for Netanyahu should he decide to participate in the event.

In a rare display of unanimity between the government and the president, Tusk's government passed a resolution supporting Duda's request the same day.

However, the resolution did not mention Netanyahu by name, which was understandable given that the Israeli prime minister did not actually plan to attend in person — as [_The Times of Israel_ confirmed](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/netanyahu-aide-says-attending-auschwitz-memorial-in-poland-currently-not-in-the-program/ "External link — The Times of Israel confirmed")
 on January 9.

Nevertheless, the decision was met with opposition and protest in [Poland](/en/poland/t-19070837)
.

Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said the case was 'very delicate'Image: Antoni Byszewski/Fotonews/Newspix/IMAGO

So, if Netanyahu was not planning to come, why did the Polish government pass the resolution in the first place?

'Tribute to the Jewish people'
------------------------------

The resolution stated that the guarantee of safety for Israeli representatives was "part of paying tribute to the Jewish people, millions of whose daughters and sons were victims of the Holocaust perpetrated by the Third Reich."

Tusk himself said the case was "very delicate."

"On the one hand," he said, "we have the verdict of an international tribunal, but on the other, it is absolutely clear to me that any representative of the Israeli authorities should have every right to and sense of security when visiting the Auschwitz camp, especially on the anniversary \[of its liberation\]."

Critical reactions in Poland
----------------------------

One of the first prominent critics of the government's decision was a respected Polish judge, Piotr Hofmanski, a former ICC president.

Hofmanski underlined Poland's unconditional obligation under international law to execute the warrant. [Skip to more DW sites](#footer)

There were protests in Warsaw on the day after the Polish government passed a resolution guaranteeing safe conduct for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin NetanyahuImage: Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto/IMAGO

There are places on Polish soil that hold a deep significance not only for Poles, but also for Jews and many people in Israel. Only 24.2% favored guaranteeing Netanyahu safe conduct, and 16.6% were undecided.

Pro-Palestinian activists organized a protest in Warsaw, during which several hundred people chanted "Arrest Netanyahu!" and "The Polish government's got blood on its hands."

A group of NGOs, including the initiative East, a Gen-Z organization fighting for social justice and against climate change, Action for Democracy and All-Poland Women's Strike also wrote an open letter asking Tusk to withdraw the resolution.

The Polish Supreme Bar Council appealed to the president and the government to adhere unconditionally to the rule of law and implement it in word and deed.

In an open letter, the council stressed that the rulings of courts and international tribunals must not be viewed as a matter of choice and that the non-execution of the ICC warrant would undermine "the trust of the citizens in the rule of law in Poland" and is dangerous — even if the external security of the country dictates it.

What's the role of the US?
--------------------------

The reference to Poland's external security could have been a response to media reports about another alleged motivation behind the resolution.

The arrest of the head of the Israeli government at the most notorious and symbolic site of the Holocaust would undoubtedly spark an international outcry and trigger a fierce response from the recently inaugurated Trump administration, a strong ally of both Poland and Israel.

Polish media quoted anonymous sources close to the government who claimed that the resolution was mainly aimed at averting the very real risk of a crisis in [US](/en/united-states-of-america/t-19065189)
\-Polish relations right at the start of the second [Trump](/en/donald-trump/t-19434433)
 administration.

Moreover, on January 9, the US House of Representatives passed a bill threatening to impose sanctions against anyone who helps the ICC prosecute US citizens or US allies, which includes Israel.

Did the president set a trap for Tusk?
--------------------------------------

Whether it was his intention or not, President Duda, due to leave office at the end of his second term in August, created a difficult situation for the government four months ahead of country's presidential election.

This election could determine whether Prime Minister Tusk will have an ally in the presidential palace and, therefore, a potentially easier path to implementing his campaign promises or face the prospect of working with a second president linked to the [opposition Law and Justice (PiS) party](/en/law-and-justice-pis/t-66789976)
.

The resolution passed by Tusk and his government might not only cost his ally and preferred presidential candidate, Rafal Trzaskowski, votes, but may have dented Poland's credibility on the global stage — with the notable exception of its relations with the Trump White House.

The resolution pledging not to arrest Netanyahu was also met with widespread opposition across the Polish political spectrum. Journalists, experts, bloggers, political commentators, judicial authorities and the opposition — from the far left to the far right — condemned the decision, albeit for different reasons.

The resolution caused uproar among left-wing activists and politicians, as well as supporters of the Palestinian cause.

"Not in my name," posted Adrian Zandberg, leader of the Polish left-wing Razem (Together) party, on X (formerly Twitter).

This attitude was also reflected in opinion polls.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that in January 2025, Poland was prepared to protect Netanyahu from potential arrest. This suggests that Netanyahu was expected to be in Poland around that time. However, the provided evidence does not mention anything about an Iranian missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, nor does it confirm that Netanyahu fled to Poland on that date.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence. The evidence is missing information about Netanyahu's whereabouts on October 1, 2024, and any connection to an Iranian missile attack.

However, the provided evidence does not mention anything about an Iranian missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, nor does it confirm that Netanyahu fled to Poland on that date.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence. The evidence is missing information about Netanyahu's whereabouts on October 1, 2024, and any connection to an Iranian missile attack.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/9/poland-says-it-will-protect-benjamin-netanyahu-from-potential-arrest](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/9/poland-says-it-will-protect-benjamin-netanyahu-from-potential-arrest)) reported on January 9, 2025, that Poland will protect Benjamin Netanyahu from potential arrest, referencing an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) <image:1>. The Polish government adopted a resolution allowing senior Israeli officials, including Netanyahu, to travel freely to Poland for the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp on January 27, 2025.

The Los Angeles Times ([https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-01-09/polish-president-seeks-protection-for-netanyahu-if-he-attends-auschwitz-anniversary-event](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-01-09/polish-president-seeks-protection-for-netanyahu-if-he-attends-auschwitz-anniversary-event)) also reported on January 9, 2025, that the Polish President is seeking protection for Benjamin Netanyahu if he attends the Auschwitz anniversary event <image:k>. DW.COM ([https://www.dw.com/en/auschwitz-poland-netanyahu-arrest-pledge/a-71377468](https://www.dw.com/en/auschwitz-poland-netanyahu-arrest-pledge/a-71377468)) reported on January 22, 2025, that the Polish government guaranteed safe passage to Benjamin Netanyahu, should he attend an event in Poland, also mentioning the ICC arrest warrant <image:k>.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that in January 2025, Poland was prepared to protect Netanyahu from potential arrest. This suggests that Netanyahu was expected to be in Poland around that time. However, the provided evidence does not mention anything about an Iranian missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, nor does it confirm that Netanyahu fled to Poland on that date.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence. The evidence is missing information about Netanyahu's whereabouts on October 1, 2024, and any connection to an Iranian missile attack.

Iran unleashed a major airstrike targeting sites across Israel on Tuesday night, while Israel's air defenses shot down most of the 180 incoming missiles, according to Israeli officials.

The Iranian attack marked the latest escalation in fighting that now stretches into several countries in the region, with warnings that more fighting is likely. They include the assassination of Hezbollah's leader, [Hassan Nasrallah](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/28/g-s1-25302/who-was-hassan-nasrallah-the-hezbollah-leader-killed-by-israel)

Israel's government had warned the public that an attack was coming, and civilians took to bomb shelters nationwide before and during the strike. Accessibility links

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that in January 2025, Poland was prepared to protect Netanyahu from potential arrest. This suggests that Netanyahu was expected to be in Poland around that time. However, the provided evidence does not mention anything about an Iranian missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, nor does it confirm that Netanyahu fled to Poland on that date.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence. The evidence is missing information about Netanyahu's whereabouts on October 1, 2024, and any connection to an Iranian missile attack.

Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile system intercepts rockets, as seen from Ashkelon, Israel, October 1 \[Amir Cohen/Reuters\]

By [Al Jazeera Staff](/author/al_jazeera_staff_150119130629458)

Published On 1 Oct 20241 Oct 2024

Iran has launched an unprecedented attack against Israel, firing a barrage of missiles at the country in [the latest escalation](/news/liveblog/2024/10/1/israels-war-on-gaza-israel-says-it-will-respond-to-iran-missile-attacks)
 amid weeks of soaring violence and tensions in the region.

Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said on Tuesday that it [fired missiles](/news/2024/10/1/israel-says-iran-launches-missile-attack-warns-residents-to-shelter)
 at Israel in response to deadly Israeli attacks against people in Gaza and Lebanon, as well as the assassinations of top IRGC, Hamas and Hezbollah leaders.

Alarms sounded in Israel on Tuesday evening as the missiles fell on major cities and towns.

Israel and its top ally, [the United States](/news/2024/10/1/us-says-helped-israel-thwart-iranian-attack-reasserts-ironclad-support)
, said their respective militaries worked together to shoot down most of the nearly 200 projectiles that were fired by Iran.

The Israeli army said only a “few” hits were recorded in central and southern parts of the country while two people were injured from falling shrapnel in the Tel Aviv area, according to Israel’s emergency service.

Here’s what we know about the attack, the wider context, and what could come next.

What happened?
--------------

*   The exact details of the Iranian operation remain unclear, but the IRGC said in a statement that the missiles were aimed at “vital military and security targets” in Israel.
*   The IRGC said later that its attack was aimed specifically at three military bases in the Tel Aviv area.
*   The attack, which was accompanied by a large-scale cyberattack, also employed Iran’s new Fatah hypersonic ballistic missiles for the first time, according to Iranian state media.
*   The Israeli military said it intercepted “a large number” of the 180 ballistic missiles launched by Iran, but that there were “isolated” impacts in central and southern Israel. We absolutely need a ceasefire.”

What comes next?
----------------

*   Israeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari said Israel is “fully prepared to defend and retaliate” against the Iranian attack, stressing that it would be in a “timely manner”.
*   Sullivan, the White House adviser, told reporters that the Biden administration “made clear that there will be consequences — severe consequences — for this attack” by Iran, and the US “will work with Israel to make that the case”.
*   Iran has warned Israel against responding to its attack, threatening to launch further missiles at the country if it retaliates.
*   Raed Jarrar, advocacy director at the US-based think tank DAWN, told Al Jazeera that the Middle East was now in “a full-scale regional war” that will not end without a change in American policy. The IRGC said that 90 percent of the projectiles fired hit their targets.
*   US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the American military “coordinated closely” with its Israeli counterparts to shoot down the projectiles.
*   “US naval destroyers joined Israeli air defence units in firing interceptors to shoot down inbound missiles,” Sullivan told reporters at the White House.
*   Sullivan said no deaths were reported in Israel: “In short, based on what we know at this point, this attack appears to have been defeated and ineffective,” he said.

What was the attack in response to?
-----------------------------------

*   The IRGC said Tuesday’s attack was in response to the assassination of [Hassan Nasrallah](/news/2024/9/28/israels-military-says-it-has-killed-hezbollah-leader-hassan-nasrallah)
    , the head of Lebanese group Hezbollah, and IRGC commander Abbas Nilforoushan last week in Beirut, as well as the killing of Hamas leader [Ismail Haniyeh](/news/2024/7/31/life-of-defiance-ismail-haniyeh-hamas-political-boss-killed)
     in Tehran in July.
*   Experts have warned over the past year that the Middle East was on the brink of regional war amid Israel’s war on the Gaza Strip, which has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians since October 2023.
*   Lebanese group Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel shortly after the Gaza war began, saying it aimed to support Palestinians in the besieged enclave.
*   The Israeli military has been exchanging fire with Hezbollah across the Israel-Lebanon border since that time, displacing tens of thousands of people in both countries.
*   Over the past month, the Israeli military escalated its attacks on Lebanon, striking targets in the capital Beirut and fuelling more [fears of an all-out war](/news/2024/9/24/disastrous-failure-how-biden-emboldened-israel-to-attack-lebanon)

How have world leaders reacted to the Iranian attack?
-----------------------------------------------------

*   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Iran had “made a big mistake” and “will pay for it”.
*   Israel’s envoy to the United Nations, Danny Danon, said the country “will take all necessary measures to protect the citizens of Israel”: “As we have previously made clear to the international community, any enemy that attacks Israel should expect a severe response,” Danon wrote on social media.
*   Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said in a post on X that the attack was a “decisive response” to Israel’s “aggressions”. “Do not enter into a conflict with Iran.”
*   Mohammad Javad Zarif, the strategic adviser to Pezeshkian, said “Iran has an inherent right of self-defence against repeated Israeli armed attacks against Iranian territory and its citizens.”
*   Hamas, the Palestinian group that governs Gaza, welcomed the Iranian attack as “heroic” and said it sent “a strong message to the Zionist enemy and its fascist government that will help deter and rein in their terrorism”.
*   The US pledged its “ironclad” support for Israel, with President Joe Biden saying that his country was “fully, fully, fully supportive of Israel”. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Washington would “stand by the people of Israel at this critical moment”.
*   The Pentagon [also said](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3922464/readout-of-secretary-of-defense-lloyd-j-austin-iiis-call-with-israeli-minister/)
     US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and his Israeli counterpart Yoav Gallant had discussed “the severe consequences for Iran” should it launch a “direct military attack” on Israel. 
> Western States have aided and abetted the Israeli genocide in Gaza and acquiesced in Israeli aggressions against Iran, Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and other countries in the region. “You’re going to get into the type of retaliatory action, back and forth, that spawns a greater war,” he told Al Jazeera.
*   Rahman added that Israel “has been trying to invite this war” through [its actions](/news/2024/9/20/israel-hits-beirut-lebanon-air-strike-hezbollah-fires-rockets)
     over the past several months. Iran, I think, has tried to avoid that, but it’s on the path to some type of war with Israel.”

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/9/poland-says-it-will-protect-benjamin-netanyahu-from-potential-arrest](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/9/poland-says-it-will-protect-benjamin-netanyahu-from-potential-arrest)) reported on January 9, 2025, that Poland will protect Benjamin Netanyahu from potential arrest, referencing an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) <image:1>. The Polish government adopted a resolution allowing senior Israeli officials, including Netanyahu, to travel freely to Poland for the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp on January 27, 2025.

The Los Angeles Times ([https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-01-09/polish-president-seeks-protection-for-netanyahu-if-he-attends-auschwitz-anniversary-event](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-01-09/polish-president-seeks-protection-for-netanyahu-if-he-attends-auschwitz-anniversary-event)) also reported on January 9, 2025, that the Polish President is seeking protection for Benjamin Netanyahu if he attends the Auschwitz anniversary event <image:k>. DW.COM ([https://www.dw.com/en/auschwitz-poland-netanyahu-arrest-pledge/a-71377468](https://www.dw.com/en/auschwitz-poland-netanyahu-arrest-pledge/a-71377468)) reported on January 22, 2025, that the Polish government guaranteed safe passage to Benjamin Netanyahu, should he attend an event in Poland, also mentioning the ICC arrest warrant <image:k>.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that in January 2025, Poland was prepared to protect Netanyahu from potential arrest. This suggests that Netanyahu was expected to be in Poland around that time. However, the provided evidence does not mention anything about an Iranian missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, nor does it confirm that Netanyahu fled to Poland on that date.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence. The evidence is missing information about Netanyahu's whereabouts on October 1, 2024, and any connection to an Iranian missile attack.

### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources confirm that Iran launched a missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024.

The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2024_Iranian_strikes_on_Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2024_Iranian_strikes_on_Israel)) also discusses the attack, mentioning that Benjamin Netanyahu called it a "big mistake".


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Iran launched a missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024. However, the evidence does not confirm whether Netanyahu left Israel and fled to Poland on that date. The provided sources only mention Netanyahu's potential travel to Poland in January 2025.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified due to the lack of information about Netanyahu's whereabouts on October 1, 2024.

Attack
------

On 19 October 2024, Benjamin Netanyahu’s home in Caesarea was targeted by one of three drones, believed to have been launched from Lebanon. She reported that sirens had gone off around Caesarea only after the attack on Netanyahu's residence was confirmed.[\[2\]](#cite_note-:0-2)

Responses
---------

### Israel

Benjamin Netanyahu called the attack an attempted assassination against himself and his wife [Sara Netanyahu](/wiki/Sara_Netanyahu "Sara Netanyahu")
 conducted by Iranian proxies, stating that they had "made a bitter mistake".[\[2\]](#cite_note-:0-2)
 He further stated that the attack would not hinder or dissuade Israel from "the war of revival" against Israel's enemies and to ensure Israel's security for generations.[\[8\]](#cite_note-8)

[Israeli foreign minister](/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Israel) "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)")
 [Israel Katz](/wiki/Israel_Katz "Israel Katz")
 also stated that the attack was an assassination attempt against Netanyahu and his family conducted by Iranian proxies, and called the attack another exposure of "Iran’s true face and the evil axis it leads".[\[3\]](#cite_note-:1-3)

### Axis of Resistance

[Iran](/wiki/Iran "Iran")
 stated that Hezbollah was responsible for the reported attack, according to the state-run [Islamic Republic News Agency](/wiki/Islamic_Republic_News_Agency "Islamic Republic News Agency")
, which quoted Iran's mission to the UN stating, "The action in question has been carried out by Hezbollah in Lebanon."[\[9\]](#cite_note-9)

Hezbollah stated that it had conducted multiple rocket strikes across north and central Israel on the same day of the attack, although it did not explicitly state that it was responsible for the drone attack on Netanyahu's residence.[\[2\]](#cite_note-:0-2)
 Hezbollah later claimed responsibility for the attack on 22 October 2024.[\[10\]](#cite_note-10)

Al Jazeera reporter Nour Odeh called the attack a matter of concern for [Israeli security forces](/wiki/Israeli_security_forces "Israeli security forces")
, due to the fact that the drone successfully struck its intended target 70 kilometers (43 miles) away from the Lebanese border without triggering any sirens.[\[2\]](#cite_note-:0-2)

### International

[United States Secretary of Defense](/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Defense "United States Secretary of Defense")
 [Lloyd Austin](/wiki/Lloyd_Austin "Lloyd Austin")
, after receiving information regarding the attack from [Israel's Minister of Defense](/wiki/Ministry_of_Defense_(Israel) "Ministry of Defense (Israel)")
 [Yoav Gallant](/wiki/Yoav_Gallant "Yoav Gallant")
, was reported to have been "relieved" that Netanyahu survived, and began to review adjustments to United States operations in the Middle East, including the deployment of a [Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense](/wiki/Terminal_High_Altitude_Area_Defense "Terminal High Altitude Area Defense")
 system to bolster Israeli defense against the Axis of Resistance.[\[3\]](#cite_note-:1-3)

[British Prime Minister](/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom")
 [Sir Keir Starmer](/wiki/Keir_Starmer "Keir Starmer")
 held a call with Netanyahu following the attack, expressing alarm at the use of drones.[\[11\]](#cite_note-11)

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/9/poland-says-it-will-protect-benjamin-netanyahu-from-potential-arrest](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/9/poland-says-it-will-protect-benjamin-netanyahu-from-potential-arrest)) reported on January 9, 2025, that Poland will protect Benjamin Netanyahu from potential arrest, referencing an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) <image:1>. The Polish government adopted a resolution allowing senior Israeli officials, including Netanyahu, to travel freely to Poland for the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp on January 27, 2025.

The Los Angeles Times ([https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-01-09/polish-president-seeks-protection-for-netanyahu-if-he-attends-auschwitz-anniversary-event](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-01-09/polish-president-seeks-protection-for-netanyahu-if-he-attends-auschwitz-anniversary-event)) also reported on January 9, 2025, that the Polish President is seeking protection for Benjamin Netanyahu if he attends the Auschwitz anniversary event <image:k>. DW.COM ([https://www.dw.com/en/auschwitz-poland-netanyahu-arrest-pledge/a-71377468](https://www.dw.com/en/auschwitz-poland-netanyahu-arrest-pledge/a-71377468)) reported on January 22, 2025, that the Polish government guaranteed safe passage to Benjamin Netanyahu, should he attend an event in Poland, also mentioning the ICC arrest warrant <image:k>.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that in January 2025, Poland was prepared to protect Netanyahu from potential arrest. This suggests that Netanyahu was expected to be in Poland around that time. However, the provided evidence does not mention anything about an Iranian missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, nor does it confirm that Netanyahu fled to Poland on that date.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence. The evidence is missing information about Netanyahu's whereabouts on October 1, 2024, and any connection to an Iranian missile attack.

The evidence confirms that Iran launched a missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024. However, the evidence does not confirm whether Netanyahu left Israel and fled to Poland on that date. The provided sources only mention Netanyahu's potential travel to Poland in January 2025.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified due to the lack of information about Netanyahu's whereabouts on October 1, 2024.

[![Prime Minister Benjmain Netanyahu leads a cabinet meeting in Jerusalem, Oct. 7, 2024. 7, 2024. 7, 2024. (Amos Ben Gershom/GPO)

The cabinet met Monday in an underground secure location in Jerusalem’s governmental complex and not at the Prime Minister’s Office due to security concerns, at the recommendation of the Shin Bet.

The decision was made due to an increase in threats against senior Israeli officials and in light of last week’s Hezbollah drone attack on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s home.

Government sources told news outlets that the move would not be a one-time event, and that cabinet meetings are expected to be held in changing locations for the near future due to the same security concerns.

Ministers were notified of the decision only in the morning, and were told that their advisers would not be allowed in due to the constraints of the space.

Three drones were launched from Lebanon in the attack on Netanyahu’s private residence in Caesarea earlier this month. <image:6670>

Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/1/irans-missile-attack-against-israel-what-we-know-and-what-comes-next](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/1/irans-missile-attack-against-israel-what-we-know-and-what-comes-next)) and NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/g-s1-25707/iran-israel-hezbollah-lebanon-attack](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/g-s1-25707/iran-israel-hezbollah-lebanon-attack)) reported on the attack, with Al Jazeera stating it was in response to Israeli actions and NPR noting that Israel intercepted most missiles <image:1>, <image:281>. The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2024_Iranian_strikes_on_Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2024_Iranian_strikes_on_Israel)) also discusses the attack, mentioning that Benjamin Netanyahu called it a "big mistake".


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Iran launched a missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024. However, the evidence does not confirm whether Netanyahu left Israel and fled to Poland on that date. The provided sources only mention Netanyahu's potential travel to Poland in January 2025.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified due to the lack of information about Netanyahu's whereabouts on October 1, 2024.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/9/poland-says-it-will-protect-benjamin-netanyahu-from-potential-arrest](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/9/poland-says-it-will-protect-benjamin-netanyahu-from-potential-arrest)) reported on January 9, 2025, that Poland will protect Benjamin Netanyahu from potential arrest, referencing an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) <image:1>. The Polish government adopted a resolution allowing senior Israeli officials, including Netanyahu, to travel freely to Poland for the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp on January 27, 2025.

The Los Angeles Times ([https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-01-09/polish-president-seeks-protection-for-netanyahu-if-he-attends-auschwitz-anniversary-event](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-01-09/polish-president-seeks-protection-for-netanyahu-if-he-attends-auschwitz-anniversary-event)) also reported on January 9, 2025, that the Polish President is seeking protection for Benjamin Netanyahu if he attends the Auschwitz anniversary event <image:k>. DW.COM ([https://www.dw.com/en/auschwitz-poland-netanyahu-arrest-pledge/a-71377468](https://www.dw.com/en/auschwitz-poland-netanyahu-arrest-pledge/a-71377468)) reported on January 22, 2025, that the Polish government guaranteed safe passage to Benjamin Netanyahu, should he attend an event in Poland, also mentioning the ICC arrest warrant <image:k>.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that in January 2025, Poland was prepared to protect Netanyahu from potential arrest. This suggests that Netanyahu was expected to be in Poland around that time. However, the provided evidence does not mention anything about an Iranian missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, nor does it confirm that Netanyahu fled to Poland on that date.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence. The evidence is missing information about Netanyahu's whereabouts on October 1, 2024, and any connection to an Iranian missile attack.

# Instructions
In order to find evidence that helps your fact-check, you just ran a web search which yielded a Search Result. **Your task right now is to summarize the Search Result.** What to include:
* information that might be useful for the fact-check (see Record)
* relevant images (refer to images by inserting their reference <image:k>)
* if available: the release date as well as the author or the publisher (e.g. the media company) of the search result.

Do NOT include:
* advertisements
* any other information not related to the Record or the Claim

Additional rules:
* Do not add any additional information besides the information in the Search Result.
* If the Search Result doesn't contain any relevant information for the fact-checking work, simply print one word in capital letters: "NONE".
* Keep your writing style like in the Examples 1, 2 and 3 provided to you.
* Try to filter out relevant information even if the search result is in a different language.

# Example 1
The search result from America Today provides several photographs of the Notre-Dame Cathedral fire on April 15, 2019. <image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>. None of the images show the Eiffel Tower in the background. 

# Example 2
NONE

# Example 3
The Guardian discusses a report blaming the Syrian government for a toxic gas attack and condemning their use of chemical weapons. The Guardian mentions the Chemical Weapons Convention and the responsibilities of Syria under the convention. According to The Guardian, The White House condemned the Assad regime for defying the norm against chemical weapons use.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:50> This image shows Israel's 9/11 memorial which is the only one outside the US."

## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:50>)
web_search("Israel 9/11 memorial")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.63, 'Palestine': 0.26, 'Jordan': 0.05, 'United States': 0.05, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0, 'Austria': 0.0, 'Bangladesh': 0.0}

### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources describe the 9/11 Living Memorial Plaza in Jerusalem, Israel, which was completed in 2009. The memorial, designed by Eliezer Weishoff, is a 30-foot high bronze sculpture of a waving American flag transforming into a flame. The memorial includes plaques commemorating the victims of the 9/11 attacks, including five Israelis.

The memorial is located in Jerusalem Park and was established by KKL-JNF. A metal remnant from the Twin Towers is incorporated into the memorial. The sources include several images of the memorial (<image:50>

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the image depicts the 9/11 Living Memorial in Jerusalem, Israel. The memorial is a bronze sculpture of a waving American flag transforming into a flame. The memorial was designed by Eliezer Weishoff and includes plaques commemorating the victims of the 9/11 attacks.

The evidence does not explicitly state whether this is the only 9/11 memorial outside the US. Therefore, the claim's veracity cannot be fully determined.

To verify the claim, additional information is needed to confirm whether other 9/11 memorials exist outside the United States.

Rumors that Ismail Qaani, the former commander of Iran’s [Quds Force](https://www.jfeed.com/tags/iran "Quds Force")
, might be a spy for [Israel’s Mossad](https://www.jfeed.com/middleeast/iran-executes-alleged-israeli-spies " Israel’s Mossad")
 have circulated widely, particularly in recent months. These claims gained traction after Qaani’s sudden disappearance following an Israeli airstrike in Beirut on October 4, 2024, targeting Hezbollah’s [Hashem Safieddine](https://www.jfeed.com/tags/spmgxi "Hashem Safieddine")
, whom Qaani was supposed to meet. His absence, coupled with Israel’s successful strikes against high-profile Iranian and Hezbollah figures, sparked intense speculation about his loyalty.

Reports from outlets like The Sun, Middle East Eye, and Hindustan Times in October 2024 suggested that Iranian authorities placed Qaani under house arrest and interrogated him, suspecting he leaked critical intelligence that enabled Israel to pinpoint targets, including the assassinations of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah on September 27, 2024, and Safieddine.

Some sources claimed he suffered a heart attack during questioning, adding to the drama. A Middle East Eye source alleged the “breach was 100 percent Iranian,” hinting at internal compromise, though no hard evidence was provided.

Iranian officials, including an [IRGC](https://www.jfeed.com/tags/irgc "IRGC")
 adviser and [Quds Force](https://www.jfeed.com/tags/quds-force "Quds Force")
 deputy Iraj Masjedi, countered these rumors, asserting Qaani was in “perfect health” and even slated for a military honor from Ayatollah Khamenei. Posts on X have amplified the theory, with some users jokingly or seriously suggesting Qaani was an Israeli asset who fed intelligence leading to the deaths of Nasrallah, Safieddine, and even himself, reportedly killed in an Israeli airstrike on June 13, 2025, per The New York Times.

Critically, the establishment narrative, pushed by Iranian denials and Israeli silence, leans toward dismissing these rumors as propaganda or internal power plays within Iran’s security apparatus. Qaani’s reported death in June 2025 complicates the story further, leaving the spy allegations as unproven speculation, possibly a mix of disinformation and genuine suspicion amid a shadow war where truth is a casualty.

Iran News has jumped on the bandwagon too. But here’s what no one’s talking about—those who weren’t.

Have you noticed that the Quds Force commander, Ismail Qaani, is one of the only senior figures still alive and untouched?

As a reminder: about six months ago, a strong rumor spread that he was a Mossad agent, after he went off the radar for several days following the Dahieh bombing in Beirut."

Esmail Qaani, Commander of the IRGC Quds Force, participates in a religious ceremony in Tehran on June 13th. \[Getty\]

The commander of [Iran's Quds Force](https://www.newarab.com/news/after-irans-rockets-hit-israel-commits-massacres-gaza)
 Esmail Qaani is in "good health", the unit's deputy commander said Monday, following claims he had possibly been assassinated by Israel

Iraj Masjedi said Qaani, who heads the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps' (IRGC) expeditionary force was safe and no further statement on the issue is needed.

It follows comments made by two senior Iranian security officials on Sunday that Qaani had not been heard from since a huge wave of Israeli airstrikes on Beirut late last week, which is believed to have killed senior Hezbollah and Iranian commanders.

Qaani traveled to Lebanon after an Israeli air strike killed [Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah](https://www.newarab.com/news/israel-military-says-hezbollah-chief-nasrallah-eliminated)
 and IRGC top general Abbas Nilforoushan in Beirut.

Contact with Nasrallah's replacement Hashem Safieddine has also been reportedly lost, with fears in the group that he could have been targeted and killed also in the strikes, which have resulted in hundreds of civilians killed.

On Tuesday, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps [fired some 200 missiles](https://www.newarab.com/news/irans-khamenei-says-iran-missile-attack-israel-legitimate)
 at Israel in retaliation for the killings of the leaders. 

It was Iran's second direct attack on Israel in six months, after a missile and drone assault in April in retaliation for a deadly strike on Iran's consulate in Damascus, which Tehran blamed on Israel.

Tehran named Qaani the head of the Revolutionary Guards Corps' overseas force after US President Donald Trump ordered the assassination of [Qassem Soleimani](https://www.newarab.com/video/twin-blast-kills-dozens-irans-qassem-soleimani-memorial)
 in a drone strike in Baghdad in 2020.

Part of Qaani's task in that post has been to manage Tehran's paramilitary allies across the Middle East, as well as in other regions around the world, who have been key pillars of support for Iran's axis allies in the region, including Syrian dictator Bashar Al-Assad.

These groups have been heavily targeted by Israeli forces in recent months, including the Hashd Al-Shaabi in Iraq, the [Houthis of Yemen](https://www.newarab.com/news/official-denies-us-offered-recognise-houthi-sanaa-government)
, and Iranian-led Shia militias in Syria.

When Qaani took over the force after deputising Soleimani for over two decades, he vowed to boot US forces out of the Middle East in revenge for Soleimani's killing.

"We promise to continue martyr Soleimani's path with the same force ... and the only compensation for us would be to remove America from the region," state radio quoted Qaani as saying ahead of Soleimani's funeral in Tehran.

Qaani, 67, was born in Mashhad, a conservative Shia Muslim religious city in northeastern Iran. He fought for the Revolutionary Guards during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, and has experience in overseas operations beyond Iran's eastern borders, including Afghanistan and Pakistan.

He does not speak Arabic, unlike Soleimani who spoke fluently with Iraqi militias and Hezbollah commanders.

He has adopted less of a public persona than Soleimani and little information is available on him online or in leaked diplomatic cables.

Unlike Soleimani, who over the years was widely photographed on battlefields in Iraq and Syria alongside the militias Tehran has armed and trained, Qaani has preferred to keep a lower profile and conduct most of his meetings and visits to neighbouring countries in private. 

He has adopted a low public profile compared to Soleimani - who was seen as a daring, down-to-earth, and charismatic figure - and little information is available on him online or in leaked diplomatic cables.

| **"From Commander to Ghost: Qaani’s Great Escape?"**  <br>  <br>  <br><br>> The X post by @MOSSADil  <br>> juxtaposes two images of Esmail Qaani, commander of Iran's IRGC Quds Force, showing him in official military attire and later in civilian disguise, hinting at an escape or survival tactic following reported Israeli airstrikes in June 2025, which The New York Times claimed killed him—yet his reappearance challenges that narrative.  <br>>   <br>> Historical context reveals Qaani’s role expanded after Qasem Soleimani’s 2020 assassination, with him overseeing extraterritorial operations and financial support to groups like Hezbollah, making him a high-value target; his survival suggests advanced evasion strategies, possibly informed by Iran’s experience with past Mossad operations.  <br>>   <br>> No peer-reviewed studies directly address this event, but intelligence analysis from sources like the Institute for National Security Studies indicates Israel’s use of AI and drones in recent strikes, implying Qaani’s escape may reflect counterintelligence adaptations to such technology, a development not yet widely acknowledged in mainstream reports.  <br>>   <br><br>[https://x.com/MOSSADil/status/1937910103413305647?t=U-jJJCUJfAiMFHTQUo7QSw&s=08](https://x.com/MOSSADil/status/1937910103413305647?t=U-jJJCUJfAiMFHTQUo7QSw&s=08)<br><br>**2 Likes**<br><br>([Share⤴](#)<br>)<br><br>*   ![](/static/copypost.svg/3)Copy Post<br><br>* * *<br><br>*   ![](/static/whatsapp.svg/3)WhatsApp<br><br>* * *<br><br>*   ![](/static/telegram.svg/3)Telegram<br><br>* * *<br><br>*   ![](/static/twitter.svg/3)Twitter<br><br>* * *<br><br>*   ![](/static/facebook.svg/3)Facebook<br><br>![](https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/19372980_screenshot20250626135815x_jpeg6f297ae460a3af6b763a91ab2860e060)<br><br>![](https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/19372981_20250626135822_jpegc08e73ef887b6ca54a330b84be6c0905)<br><br>![](https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/19372982_20250626135825_jpeg180b82528e58725485b2e7c2d1d64386)<br><br>![](https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/19372983_20250626135832_jpegdff47f83bbe7b7ca12d42dcd0cbca00f) |

There's nothing like ghosting, you either have information or you do not ...  <br>  <br>I think Nigeria should learn from Iran and have a redundant command system, Incase all the Generals are deceived into a bunker. Core personnel should avoid the limelight.. I also know telecommunications can be intercepted and cloned to look like the real person was talking no one believed me.

It contains a post titled "From Commander To Ghost: Qaani’s Great Escape?" which discusses Esmail Qaani, commander of Iran's IRGC Quds Force, and includes an image of a man in a hijab. The post references a tweet that juxtaposes images of Qaani in military attire and civilian disguise, suggesting an escape tactic after reported Israeli airstrikes.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that the image is associated with rumors and speculation about Esmail Qaani. The Nairaland forum post, published on June 26, 2025, discusses the image in the context of Qaani's alleged escape after Israeli airstrikes. The post's title, "From Commander To Ghost: Qaani's Great Escape?" implies that the image is not necessarily authentic, but rather part of a narrative. The New Arab article from October 7, 2024, states that Qaani was in good health, which contradicts the claim that he was in hiding.

The image's context is further complicated by the JFeed article, which mentions rumors of Qaani being a Mossad agent and reports of his disappearance and death. The image search results provide additional images of Qaani, but none of them show him in a hijab.

Based on the evidence, it is impossible to definitively confirm the authenticity of the image. The claim is based on speculation and rumors.

Open Extended Reactions

PARIS -- The International Judo Federation will launch an investigation into why Algeria's Messaoud Redouane Dris failed his weigh-in before a bout with Israel's Tohar Butbul -- which could be part of a pattern of sportsmanship issues.

An IJF spokesperson told ESPN those questions would be answered in due time. "Unfortunately, athletes often become victims of broader political disputes which are against the values of sport."

The Algerian federation did not immediately respond to comment when contacted by ESPN.

"I think the Algerian athletes and all the Muslim athletes cannot go to the fight with Israeli athletes," Butbul told reporters. At the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, four judoka athletes failed weigh-ins. Of Israel's 88 athletes at the Olympics, 12 compete in judo. Dris' disqualification marked the third time an opponent has not faced Butbul over the past two Olympics.

"We believe that sport should remain a realm of integrity and fairness, free from the influences of international conflicts," the IJF said in a statement. However, this isn't the first incident involving controversy and Israeli athletes in the sport. On Sunday, both Abderrahmane Boushita of Morocco and Nurali Emomali of Tajikistan refused to shake the hand of Israel's Baruch Shmailov in the under-66kg event.

In Tokyo, another Algerian, Fethi Nourine withdrew from the Olympics to avoid a potential fight against Butbul in the second round. However French President Emmanuel Macron said ahead of the Games that Israeli athletes were welcome in France, and the interior minister ordered increased 24-hour security for the Israeli Olympians days before the opening ceremony. The investigation is expected to take place at the conclusion of the Olympics, and the federation said further action will be taken if needed. They won't let them compete, even though they are athletes."

Algerian judoka investigated after failing to make weight for bout with Israeli
===============================================================================

This article is more than 11 months old

*   Messaoud Redouane Dris’s actions labelled ‘a disgrace’
*   Fears athletes can become ‘victims of political disputes’

Judo’s governing body is to investigate why Algeria’s Messaoud Redouane Dris failed the weigh-in for his -73kg bout with Israel’s Tohar Butbul at the Paris Olympics, saying athletes can become “victims of broader political disputes”.

The International Judo Federation (IJF) said Dris arrived for the weight control session on Sunday 10 minutes before the deadline and was found to be 400g over the allowed weight limit to compete on Monday. However, an Algerian newspaper hailed the judoka for “smartly avoiding meeting \[the\] Israeli opponent by failing to make the weight”.

One of the Algerian athletes’ sponsors, the telecom giant Mobilis, posted on Facebook: “Dris won everyone’s respect. My heart goes out to this athlete.”

Arad, a former judoka and the first Israeli to win an Olympics medal, told Reuters: “I think this is a disgrace. Algerian media and a sponsor of Algeria’s Olympic athletes hailed Dris.

“Following the [Olympic Games](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympic-games)
, a full review and investigation of the situation will be conducted and further action will be taken if needed,” the IJF said in a statement on Monday. Unfortunately, athletes often become victims of broader political disputes which are against the values of sport.”

The Paris Games are taking place amid pronounced security concerns and heightened geopolitical tensions, including over Israel’s war in Gaza following the 7 October attacks led by the Palestinian group Hamas.

The Algerian Olympic delegation declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. Dris was subsequently disqualified, with the bout awarded to Butbul, who then lost in the round of 16.

PARIS (AP) — The International Judo Federation will conduct an investigation after Messaoud Dris of Algeria missed weight at the [Paris Games](https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games)
 on the day before he was scheduled to face Tohar Butbul of Israel.

The bout was scheduled to be the first in the men’s 73-kilogram division Monday, but given its political implications, many suspected it would not happen from the moment Dris and Butbul were matched in the random draw last week.

“Following the Olympic Games, a full review and investigation of the situation will be conducted and further action will be taken if needed,” the IJF said in a statement on Monday.

It added that athletes failing to pass weight control is not unusual at judo competitions, noting that four judokas missed weight at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago.

“We believe that sport should remain a realm of integrity and fairness, free from the influences of international conflicts,” the judo federation said. Supreme Court](https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court)

Judo governing body to investigate Algerian who missed weight before Olympic bout against Israeli

“I think the Algerian athletes and all the Muslim athletes cannot go to the fight with Israeli athletes,” Butbul said. The IJF said Dris only showed up to the weigh-in 10 minutes before the deadline, which could indicate he had actually been trying and failing to cut weight.

The bout was Butbul’s third walkover victory in the past two Olympics, including two against Algerian opponents. Israel’s presence at the Paris Games has been protested at various points since the beginning of Israel’s offensive in Gaza last year, but the IOC and France’s government have firmly backed Israel’s right to participate.

Israel has one of the biggest judo teams at the Paris Games with 12 participants, and four Israeli judokas competed in the first two days of the tournament at Arena Champ-de-Mars.

Although none of their opponents avoided Israel’s first four judokas, Abderrahmane Boushita of Morocco and Nurali Emomali of Tajikistan both refused to shake the hand of Israel’s Baruch Shmailov following their bouts Sunday. “Unfortunately, athletes often become victims of broader political disputes which are against the values of sport.”

Butbul and Israel coach Guy Fogel said they believe Dris was pressured to miss the bout because of Algeria’s fraught relationship with Israel, which has led to several similar incidents in recent judo competitions.

[### قصة الطفلة شام من تحت الأنقاض إلى مستشفى "برجيل" بأبو ظبي](https://www.enabbaladi.net/archives/633180)

> _**The nine-year-old Sham al-Sheikh Mohammed and her brother Omar have received wide interaction on social media since they got out after 40 hours from under the rubble in the town of Armanaz in the northern Idlib region following the massive earthquake that struck the area on February 6.**_

Sympathy for the child who sang “The Melody of Life” under the rubble was accompanied by political exploitation by the Syrian regime, whose media coverage was absent from Idlib during the first days of the earthquake and was present in the case of the child Sham, and some other cases through which it wanted to send a “political message.”

**Stuck under rubble**
----------------------

On February 7, volunteers from the Syria Civil Defense (SCD), also known as The White Helmets, rescued Sham and her brother Omar from under the rubble 40 hours after the earthquake that struck southern Turkey and four Syrian governorates. But Sham lost her mother and sister.

Sham read verses from the Holy Qur’an while she was stuck under the rubble of her house and sang the song “Ya Sham, you are our Sham” (Ash-Sham: The colloquial name of Damascus), inspiring hope in the hearts of the people and volunteers.

After her rescue, she was transferred to al-Shifaa Hospital in Idlib city.

Dr. Mohammad al-Youssef, director of the intensive care unit at al-Shifa Hospital, said in a [video recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW4ZkGozYDA)
 that the pressure of the rubble on the child’s lower limbs led to the interruption of blood flow to them, and they were threatened with amputation.

Sham and her brother suffered from crush syndrome, which posed a great threat to their lives, in conjunction with the great pressure in hospitals in northern Syria and the lack of medical equipment and supplies.

**From Idlib to Adana**
-----------------------

On February 23, ambulances transported the child Sham and her brother, accompanied by their father, to Adana Şehir Hospital in Adana state, southern Turkey, after supervision and coordination between the health ministry of the Syrian Salvation Government (SSG) operating in Idlib, and the Turkish authorities.

The child and her brother remained in the [emergency department](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1330973717761556)
 designated to receive all cases and not in the intensive care unit, with the cries of the child and her brother and demanded to return them to Idlib during their appearance in a video recording.

Their presence in the emergency department requires them to receive painkillers only and to wait until they get a turn to perform the operation at an unspecified time due to the overcrowding in the hospital, with the lack of coordination between the hospital staff and any party.

A video of the child in pain from inside the hospital received wide interaction, followed by activists on social media launching a campaign to save her, entitled “Save Sham and Omar.”

Hussein Bazar, health minister in the [Salvation Government](https://t.me/SG_M_Health/2189)
, said that the ministry is following up on the medical situation and the care provided to Sham and her brother after they entered Turkish territory to complete their treatment for crush syndrome on a permanent basis.

Upon noticing the delay in receiving the required care for their difficult condition, and after communication, “we received confirmation from high-ranking Turkish medical authorities to follow up the case directly,” Bazar added.

**From Adana to Istanbul**
--------------------------

On February 25, the little girl and her brother, accompanied by their father, arrived in Istanbul on a private plane belonging to the Turkish Health Ministry to receive treatment in coordination with the [Ataa for Humanitarian Relief](https://ataarelief.org/en/)
 organization, which followed up on the case directly.

Ataa administration told _Enab Baladi_ that the role of the association was represented in sponsoring the accompanying family in terms of housing, transportation, and clothes, coordinating the transfer of Sham, her brother, and the family from Adana to Istanbul, and securing their admission to the Çam ve Sakura government hospital in the Başakşehir region.

Ataa pointed out that the Turkish government provided a private plane from the ministry of health to transport Sham and her brother from Adana to Istanbul and to host them in the Çam ve Sakura Hospital at the government’s expense, with the provision of a specialized medical staff to follow up on the case.

**From Istanbul to Abu Dhabi**
------------------------------

On February 28, the child and her brother were transferred to Burjeel Medical City in Abu Dhabi to receive treatment under the supervision of the Emirates Red Crescent and in cooperation with [Burjeel Hospital](https://www.skynewsarabia.com/business/1604241-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%B6%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D8%AD%D9%82%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%94%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%94%D8%B1%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%AD-%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%AE%D9%87%D8%A7-2022?q=%D8%A8%D8%B1%D8%AC%D9%8A%D9%84&r=1601612)
, which formed a specialized medical team for the child and her brother, and provided urgent treatment for them.

After the two children arrived at the hospital, surgeries were performed by Dr. Michael Oğlu, as the life of the child Sham was threatened as a result of gangrene that spread in the lower part of the body, and her brother Omar was also saved, according to the Emirates News Agency (WAM).

The agency said that Sham and Omar arrived under the directives of the Supreme Chairwoman of the Family Development Foundation, Honorary President of the Emirates Red Crescent (Mother of the Nation), Sheikha Fatima bint Mubarak.

Ataa Relief told _Enab Baladi_ that the child was transferred to the Emirates after its consulate contacted Sham’s father, as the Turkish authorities left the matter to her father, who agreed to transfer her and transfer the entire family to the Emirates to complete the treatment of Sham and her brother Omar in the UAE hospitals.

The Syrian regime’s officials and media coverage ignored mentioning Idlib governorate when talking about the areas affected by the earthquake, despite the fact that the death toll there was more than double the number of deaths in the areas under the regime’s control.

The statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs released the day after the earthquake ignored Idlib when it mentioned the affected areas, limiting itself to mentioning Aleppo, Latakia, and Hama in the statement calling for the lifting of sanctions.

On the fifth day of the earthquake, February 10, the regime mentioned Idlib for the first time during the disaster when it included it by announcing the areas affected by the earthquake (Aleppo, Hama, Latakia, and Idlib).

Nizar al-Farra, a TV host on the pro-regime Syrian Sama channel, published on February 25, quoting what he called “private sources,” that the “Syrian government” is trying through several channels, with Russian and Emirati mediation, to [persuade](https://www.facebook.com/nizar.alfarra.16/posts/pfbid0AozU4hzimZyQepTcUFSnhgXyuYWUHi8BB4mSyFEswjAfsHbW1P388vKeSYftMndAl)
 the Turkish authorities to hand over the child Sham and her brother to the Syrian health authorities to send them to the Emirates for treatment.

He stated that efforts are continuing to include the two children with six Syrian children from Aleppo and Latakia, who arrived for treatment in the UAE at the initiative of the “Syrian Presidency,” adding that the Turkish side still refuses to hand over the child or even send her directly to the UAE for treatment.

Al-Farra said, on March 1, that the child, [Sham](https://www.facebook.com/nizar.alfarra.16/posts/pfbid0oaeTUQTdyQNQXFaJEHyArKXnSV8wCKUujovauZZyT7Xu6TcGVb8VzRYYxV3HDX6nl)
, is in the UAE to be treated and that the efforts of the “Syrian State” have succeeded after “Turkey has repeatedly refused to send her and exploited her situation and health for political ends.”

Asma al-Assad, the wife of the head of the Syrian regime, appeared in a video recording published by the “Presidency of the Syrian Republic” page on Facebook, which includes a recorded call with the child Sham, which caused a wave of anger and resentment among the Syrians, who considered it “political exploitation and trading in the pain of the Syrians.”

Asma al-Assad hinted that she was aware of the child’s transfer and arrival to the Emirates, telling Sham, “You have to come back to me.”

Sham appeared in a video in one scene with her head shaved and wearing a hat in another scene, which raised suspicions that the recording was subjected to a “montage” and “editing” process.

**Family ‘doesn’t know’**
-------------------------

With the spread of the recording of Asma al-Assad’s call with Sham, local pages and activists shared audio recordings of the child’s father, who denied knowing about Asma al-Assad’s call, saying, “I was not in the hospital, and I had no knowledge of the call, and I heard about it just like you.”

The father explained that he was not satisfied from the beginning with the removal of his two children from Idlib governorate, adding, “I never had the desire to leave, but they told me that I had to travel under the pretext of securing doctors and housing for us. I will not forgive them before God; they destroyed my children.”

Activists also circulated an audio recording said to be of her brother Omar, who said that his father was not aware of the call, but people do not understand this matter.

**Children, victims of the regime**
-----------------------------------

The Syrian Network for Human Rights ([SNHR](https://snhr.org/arabic/2023/03/13/%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%86%d8%b8%d8%a7%d9%85-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b3%d9%88%d8%b1%d9%8a-%d9%82%d8%aa%d9%84-%d9%85%d8%a7-%d9%84%d8%a7-%d9%8a%d9%82%d9%84-%d8%b9%d9%86-22981-%d8%b7%d9%81%d9%84%d8%a7-%d9%81%d9%8a/)
) said on March 13 that the Syrian regime had killed no less than 22,981 children in Syria since March 2011, including 190 due to torture, and 5,199 children are still detained or forcibly disappeared.

SNHR stated that the regime assigned the task of recruiting children to the unofficial forces it formed, such as the National Defense Forces and groups and brigades of foreign and local militias, through its affiliation centers.

These forces relied on the encouragement of children and their families and provided them with many facilities. The recruitment process took on a more organized and systematic character with the formation of the National Defense Forces.

According to the monitoring group, children participated in military operations, whether as combatants or as participants in transporting ammunition, strengthening the fronts, cleaning weapons, guarding, and other missions.

**Asma Assad takes advantage of Sham’s conditions**
---------------------------------------------------

Neither regime officials nor media reports mentioned Idlib province when referring to areas affected by the quake, despite the fact that the death toll there was more than double that of regime-controlled areas.

In a statement issued the day after the earthquake, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not mention Idlib when referring to the affected area, and only mentioned Aleppo, Latakia and Khazanah in the statement calling for the lifting of sanctions. horse.

On February 10, the fifth day of the quake, the authorities mentioned Idlib for the first time when announcing the areas affected by the quake (Aleppo, Hama, Latakia and Idlib).

On February 25, Nizar al-Farra, a TV host on the pro-regime Syrian channel Sama, published an article citing what he called a “private source” that the “Syrian government” was trying to reach through multiple channels , under the mediation of Russia and the UAE, [persuade](https://www.facebook.com/nizar.alfarra.16/posts/pfbid0AozU4hzimZyQepTcUFSnhgXyuYWUHi8BB4mSyFEswjAfsHbW1P388vKeSYftMndAl)
 Turkish authorities handed over the child, Sham, and her brother to Syrian health authorities so they could be sent to the UAE for treatment.

who is receiving treatment in the UAE, the efforts of the “Syrian state” were successful after “Turkey repeatedly refused to send her and exploited her situation and health for political purposes.”

The wife of the head of the Syrian regime, Asma al-Assad, appeared on Facebook’s “Presidential Palace of the Syrian Republic” page and posted a video recording, including a recording of a call with her child Sham, which sparked a wave of anger and dissatisfaction among Syrians. Think it’s a “political exploitation and painful deal for Syrians”.

Asma al-Assad implied she knew the children had been diverted and arrived in the UAE, telling Sham, “You have to come back to me.”

Shan appears in a video with her head shaved in one scene and a hat in another, making it suspicious that the recording was “montaged” and “edited”.

Syrian Network for Human Rights ([SNHR](https://snhr.org/arabic/2023/03/13/%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%86%d8%b8%d8%a7%d9%85-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b3%d9%88%d8%b1%d9%8a-%d9%82%d8%aa%d9%84-%d9%85%d8%a7-%d9%84%d8%a7-%d9%8a%d9%82%d9%84-%d8%b9%d9%86-22981-%d8%b7%d9%81%d9%84%d8%a7-%d9%81%d9%8a/)
) said on March 13 that since March 2011, the Syrian regime has killed at least 22,981 children in Syria, of which 190 were killed as a result of torture, and another 5,199 children are still detained or forcibly disappeared.

SNHR said the regime, through its affiliated centers, assigned the task of recruiting children to unofficial forces it formed, such as groups and brigades of the National Defense Forces and foreign and local militias.

These forces rely on the encouragement of the children and their families and provide them with many facilities. With the creation of the Wehrmacht, the recruitment process was more organized and systematic.

The Monitoring Group understands that children are involved in military operations, both as combatants and in tasks such as delivering ammunition, fortifying front lines, cleaning weapons, and guarding.

Tyrants learn from each other, share information, and observe the tactics of repression used by the world’s dictators and autocrats to reproduce in their own countries. Arbitrary arrests of dissidents, torture in prisons, attacks on activists’ family members, or the use of artificial intelligence to control the population are repeated almost systematically in most authoritarian regimes. “From Egypt and Iran to Russia and Venezuela, dictators copy and cooperate with each other,” warns Iranian journalist and dissident Masih Alinejad. Her denunciation coincides with the account of the dozens of defenders of human rights gathered last June at the [Oslo Freedom Forum](https://oslofreedomforum.com/norway-2023/)
, the activist convention organized every year by the [Human Rights Foundation (HRF).](https://hrf.org/)
 Their testimonies make up what could be considered a guide to the actions of modern dictators and autocrats, a set of traditional forms of repression reinforced by the options offered by new technology and the constant concern over their public image.

### Arbitrary arrests

The arbitrary detention of activists, journalists, or opponents without legitimate reasons or without due process is “a fundamental weapon of autocratic regimes,” says Félix Maradiaga. He is one of the 200 Nicaraguan political prisoners whom [Daniel Ortega’s regime banished to the United States last February](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-02-09/nicaragua-frees-over-200-political-prisoners-puts-them-on-plane-to-us.html)
 after depriving them of their nationality. “They know that by arresting dissidents they divert attention from political movements, which are forced to pause for a while and stop talking about reforms in education and health or addressing issues such as corruption,” he continues. His own experience is proof: after announcing his pre-candidacy for the presidency of the country in 2021, he was arrested on charges of “treason” and spent “611 agonizing days in one of the most atrocious maximum-security prisons in Latin America.”

The aim of these arrests, according to Venezuelan journalist Victor Navarro, is to spread terror. “Autocratic regimes feed on fear and are strengthened by silence,” he summarizes. He too was detained “arbitrarily.” “I worked in social reintegration, but in Venezuela offering opportunities can be considered a crime,” says the activist, who was accused of “treason” and “terrorism.” “About 35 police officers broke down the door of my house,” he recalls. He was locked up for five months.

Uighur Gulbahar Haitiwaji, on the other hand, had “never been involved” in political or social activities. But Xi Jinping’s regime found her guilty of “disloyalty to the Chinese government,” as part of [Beijing’s crackdown on members of the Muslim minority](https://english.elpais.com/international/2022-05-24/secret-police-files-put-a-face-to-chinas-repression-in-xinjiang-child-prisoners-and-shoot-to-kill-orders.html)
 — some 11.6 million people — in the Xinjiang autonomous region. “I lived in France with my husband and daughters and, following a call from my former employer, I planned a two-week return trip \[to Xinjiang\]... I had no idea what was waiting for me there,” recalls the woman, who spent three years in so-called “re-education centers,” internment camps where Beijing exercises its crackdown on Uighurs.

!Gulbahar Haitiwaji <image:4684>

### Torture

[Beatings, rape and inhuman and degrading treatment](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-03-26/the-rampant-abuse-in-el-salvadors-prisons-they-beat-him-to-death-in-the-cell-and-dragged-him-out-like-an-animal.html)
 are a constant in the testimony of those who have been arrested for political reasons. “In prison I suffered things that I am not yet prepared to talk about in public,” says Nicaraguan Maradiaga.

[Torture](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-05-29/inmates-in-el-salvador-tortured-and-strangled-a-report-denounces-hellish-conditions-in-bukeles-prisons.html)
 is first and foremost an attempt at “dehumanization,” Navarro says. “I was number 25510806,” the code he was assigned after entering Venezuela’s Helicoide prison. The aggressions, he reveals, were continuous. “They wouldn’t let me sleep; I heard another prisoner being suffocated, the sound of rape...,” recalls the activist, who says he went 129 days without seeing sunlight.

A red bracelet on Haitiwaji’s ankle reminds her that she survived torture in Xinjiang detention centers. The officers squeezed her shackles so tightly that they made her bleed. And in the midst of the pain, she says she whispered: “My poor ankle, you have suffered so much for me, if I ever manage to leave this place I promise that I will adorn you with a beautiful chain.” It was one of the many times the woman was interrogated in one of the so-called “tiger chairs”: “They put a black hood on us, handcuffed our hands and ankles.” But those were not the only times she was tortured: “I was chained to a bed for 20 days and the humiliation I felt was unbearable. I struggled for 10 days not to relieve myself in front of them. In the end, with a very strong pain in my stomach, I relieved myself in tears.”

The one who cannot recount the torture he suffered is Alaa Abd El-Fattah. This blogger and intellectual symbol of the Egyptian opposition has been imprisoned for almost four years after being convicted in an express trial for allegedly spreading false information on social networks. But one of his sisters, Sanaa Seif, speaks on his behalf and says that the situation is so terrible that her brother had even thought about suicide: “He said that his life was unbearable, because the worst thing was not torture, but that they deprived him of everything that gave meaning to his life, such as sunlight, music, and books... He said he lived like an animal.”

### Attacks on family members

In their strategy of spreading terror, dictators and autocrats strive to show that a dissident’s activism puts their family at risk. This is what happened to Haitiwaji. “They questioned me about my life in France, they showed me a photograph of my daughter covering herself with an East Turkestan flag \[symbol of the Uighur independence movement\] during a protest,” recalls the woman, who ended up signing a confession in which she declared that she had “gathered people to disturb the social order.”

Sanaa Seif did end up in prison three times for demanding her brother’s freedom. Aware of the pain that the detention of a loved one inflicts on families, she recounts how she combed her hair and put on makeup to try to look her best during the 20-minute visit with her mother or sister that the authorities allowed her once a month.

!Sana Seif, on June 14 in Oslo. Behind her, an image of a demonstration in which she demanded the freedom of her brother Alaa. <image:4688>

Beyond the arrest itself, the [psychological damage caused to families by the detention of a family member is very profound](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-06-11/mothers-by-force-the-silent-impact-of-president-bukeles-state-of-exception-in-el-salvador.html)
. “When they arrested me, my mom was told to look for me at the morgue,” Navarro laments. Sharing a similar anguish is Evgenia Kara-Murza, wife of Russian journalist and President Putin’s political opponent Vladimir Kara-Murza, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison for high treason because “his voice was a danger to Putin’s regime.” “The pain of having someone you love in prison is immense,” she says.

### Kleptocrat practices

“It happens in Sudan, in Yemen, in Russia, in China, in Iran... They are kleptocrat regimes,” says Casey Michel, HRF’s program director against systems of governance that prioritize the enrichment of the rich at the expense of the public interest. [Kleptocracy](https://english.elpais.com/elpais/2018/06/11/the_global_observer/1528717970_008019.html)
 is, according to Casey, one of the hallmarks of authoritarian systems, but warns that it is “a transnational phenomenon.” “Autocracies and dictatorships use the financial secrecy of places like Delaware \[United States\] to take money out of their country, whether it’s Equatorial Guinea or Angola, and enjoy it wherever they want,” he complains.

This is well known to activist Ketakandriana Rafitoson, the only judge in Madagascar who has resigned due to interference in justice, has spent her entire life dedicated to the fight against corruption. “This is the source of extreme poverty in my country,” she stresses, a state in which 75% of the population lives on less than $2 a day. “Successive leaders chose corruption as a way to govern the country,” she laments. And, as an example, she gives a figure that she considers unaffordable: “In 2013, one of the candidates for the presidential elections spent $43 million (€38.3 million) on a single campaign, in a country where people go hungry.” “If 36 candidates participated in the 2018 elections, how much money was wasted?” she asks.

> “It is a mistake to believe that there are different dictatorships, right and left, socialist and capitalist, when the reality is that it is a question of good and evil.”
> 
> Thor Halvorssen, founder of the Human Rights Foundation

The big mistake, according to Thor Halvorssen, founder of HRF, is “to believe that there are different dictatorships, right and left, socialist and capitalist, when the reality is that it is a question of good and evil,” he states. This classification, “whose objective is to divide people,” leads one to think, according to Halvorssen, that [Venezuela](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-06-14/venezuelas-economic-crisis-has-led-to-a-surge-in-suicides.html)
’s regime is, for example, socialist. “But it’s not, because everyone in power is a millionaire or a billionaire,” he says.

### The care of the international image

!Abdulrahman Almawwas <image:4699>

Asma al-Assad, the wife of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, held a video call last March with Sham Sheikh Mohammed, a nine-year-old Syrian girl who survived the earthquakes that struck Turkey and Syria on February 6, while she was receiving treatment in a hospital in Abu Dhabi. “She was trapped for more than 40 hours,” says Syrian activist Abdulrahman Almawwas, co-founder of the White Helmets, the Syrian volunteer organization specializing in rescues. The hurtful thing about that call is that the girl Assad phoned lived “in northern Syria[, an area that has been attacked and bombed by Damascus for the](https://elpais.com/internacional/2023-02-12/la-siria-rebelde-la-gran-olvidada-del-terremoto.html)
 last 10 years,” explains Almawwas, who also criticizes how dictators try to “clean up their crimes before international public opinion.”

But the most recent illustrative example of how authoritarian regimes try to whitewash their image is, for Sanaa Seif, the celebration of the United Nations Climate Summit in the Egyptian town of Sharm el Sheikh in November of last year. “Abdel Fattah al-Sisi’s regime didn’t want the stories of political prisoners to spread, so I took the risk of flying there,” she said. Her brother was on hunger strike at the time to demand improvements in his detention conditions. “Climate activists from all over the world chanted the name of Alaa and \[British Prime Minister\] Rishi Sunak, \[German Chancellor\] Olaf Scholz and \[French President\] Emmanuel Macron called for his release,” she recalls. Her brother’s prison conditions suddenly improved.

### The use of new technology

Rwandan activist Carine Kanimba’s mobile phone was infected with [Pegasus spy software](https://english.elpais.com/international/2022-05-03/pegasus-europes-deepening-spyware-scandal.html)
. The young woman, daughter of Rwandan opponent Paul Rusesabagina, the famous former manager of the Hotel Mille Collines — which Hollywood immortalized in the film _Hotel Rwanda_ — has been protesting since 2020 that her father was kidnapped from his home in San Antonio (Texas) and taken to Rwanda, where he was convicted of terrorism and sentenced to 25 years in prison. Resesabagina, an opponent of President Paul Kagame, “would never have traveled” to the African country, says his daughter, who with the help of several organizations says she discovered that the Rwandan government had been “tracking the whole family.”

“All dictatorships do the same things, although they seem to be very different; for example, now they have started using artificial intelligence and facial recognition cameras,” explains Serbian activist Srdja Popovic, promoter of the student mobilizations that precipitated the fall of former Serbian dictator Slobodan Misolevic, and current director of the Center for the Application of Nonviolent Actions and Strategies (CANVAS). So it was for Haitiwaji. “When they arrested me, they took blood samples, scanned my face and irises and recorded a sample of my voice,” she says.

And dictators share these systems, warns Nathan Law, one of the leaders of Hong Kong’s so-called umbrella revolution. “China has taken advantage of the preoccupation of the narrative that prioritizes security over freedom and sells technology that serves to identify people,” warns the young man, currently exiled in London. This software_,_ remember, has only one purpose: to suppress protests and ensure the survival of the regime.

CNN  — 

At least 30 people have been killed and over 100 injured in an Israeli airstrike on a school in Deir-al Balah, central Gaza, where thousands were sheltering, Palestinian officials said.

The Israeli military said it had launched the strike in order to destroy a Hamas command and control center inside the compound.

Most of the victims from the school arriving to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the aftermath of the attack were women and children, according to Dr. Khalil Al-Daqran, a spokesperson for the hospital.

Footage filmed by CNN inside the hospital morgue showed dead bodies on the floor and people coming in to identify their loved ones, with children among the deceased.

The emergency room is seen to be overwhelmed by casualties and has no more space for patients. One young man was seen receiving medical treatment on the floor.

Most of those brought to the hospital with injuries are children, including one young boy who was receiving treatment and soon after died with the word “unidentified” written on his stomach.

The strike came soon after Israeli’s military issued fresh evacuation orders further south, in the city of Khan Younis, where Israel launched a fresh offensive earlier in the week which has killed dozens of Palestinians.

Residents in southern neighborhoods were told to leave after being warned that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) would “forcefully operate” in the area.

Fighting has been ongoing on Gaza for months, and the renewed offensive shows Israel’s challenges in achieving its goal of eliminating Hamas. Israel said that about 100 militants had been killed during recent fighting.

The United Nations estimated that about 150,000 people fled Khan Younis on Monday alone, intensifying pressure on meager supplies of food and water, and places to seek shelter.

Signaling another campaign was imminent, the IDF wrote on Telegram it was “about to forcefully operate against the terrorist organizations and therefore calls on the remaining population left in the southern neighborhoods of Khan Yunis to temporarily evacuate to the adjusted Humanitarian Area in Al-Mawasi.”

The statement said the move was in retaliation to “significant terrorist activity and rocket fire” emanating from southern Khan Younis. At least 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 others abducted, according to Israeli authorities.

Israeli military action in Gaza has since killed 39,258 Palestinians and injured another 90,589, according to the Ministry of Health there. As of early July, [nearly 2 million people](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/06/middleeast/palestinians-displaced-gaza-israel-intl/index.html)
 had been displaced in Gaza – almost the entire population, according to figures from the UN.

Aid agencies working in Gaza have warned previously that new rounds of evacuation orders are making the delivery of emergency rations even more difficult.

“People in Gaza are exhausted, living in inhumane conditions, with no safety at all,” the UN Relief and Works Agency posted on X on Monday.

On Thursday, the IDF said it had recovered the bodies of five Israeli hostages the previous day from a tunnel in an area of Khan Younis which it had previously designated as a “humanitarian area.”

Despite the fighting, US and Israeli officials expressed optimism [this week](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/23/politics/gaza-ceasefire-prospects-netanyahu-congress/index.html)
 over the possibility of a ceasefire and hostage deal being reached.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday that the different parties are “inside the 10-yard line and driving toward the goal line.”

Negotiations are set to resume in Rome on Sunday, two sources familiar with the meeting told CNN.

The US team will be led by CIA Director Bill Burns, who will be joined by his counterparts from Qatar, Egypt, and Israel.

Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was in Washington this week and met with the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, who urged him to seal an agreement.

“As I just told Prime Minister Netanyahu, it is time to get this deal done,” said Harris. It added that the location previously defined as a humanitarian area “will be adjusted.”

Al-Mawasi has come under repeated Israeli attacks, including a strike on July 14 which [reportedly](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/13/middleeast/mawasi-deif-israel-hamas-gaza-intl/index.html)
 killed 90 people and injured 300 more.

An eyewitness in Khan Younis told CNN that she was “woken up by the screams” of people as they fled the area following the evacuation order, saying she heard explosions and saw flares in the sky.

Scenes filmed by CNN in Khan Younis show people fleeing by car, motorbike, and donkey cart with all of their belongings. I don’t know where to go,” said one man.

Israel launched its military offensive in Gaza on October 7 after Hamas attacked southern Israel."

Content: "<image:6736>!Reuters Palestinians inspect damage following an Israeli strike on Mustafa Hafez school, which was sheltering displaced people, in Gaza City, in the northern Gaza Strip (20 August 2024) <image:6737>Reuters

The UN condemned earlier this month what it called the “increasing frequency” of Israeli strikes on schools

At least 12 Palestinians have been killed in an Israeli air strike on a school housing displaced people in Gaza City, the Hamas-run Civil Defence authority says.

A spokesman said rescuers were struggling to recover a number of missing people believed to be trapped under the rubble at Mustafa Hafez school in the western Rimal neighbourhood.

The Israeli military said it had targeted a Hamas command and control centre inside the school, and that it had taken steps to mitigate risk of harming civilians.

Earlier, it announced that troops had recovered the bodies of six Israeli hostages being held in the Khan Younis area.

The men were among the 251 people kidnapped by Hamas-led gunmen in the 7 October attacks on southern Israel last year, when about 1,200 people were also killed.

Israel launching an air and ground campaign to destroy Hamas in response, during which more than 40,170 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.

Women and children can be heard screaming and seen running from the dust-enveloped Mustafa Hafez school in a video posted on social media showing the immediate aftermath of Tuesday morning’s strike.

The camera then pans to show rubble on the ground beside the completely flattened remains of a two-storey building.

"We were sitting safely, we did not see the explosion," witness Umm Mohammed later told Reuters news agency.

"The people are gone, they're dead. They are under the rubble."

Civil Defence spokesman Mahmoud Basal said in the afternoon that rescue crews had so far recovered the bodies of 12 people.

He said the strike had targeted the entire wing of the school, where he estimated that 700 displaced people had been living.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said aircraft had conducted a “a precise strike on terrorists who were operating within a Hamas command and control centre” which had been embedded inside the school and used to plan and launch attacks against its troops and Israel.

"Prior to the strike, numerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harming civilians, including the use of precise munitions, aerial surveillance and additional intelligence," it added.

The IDF accused Hamas of violating international law by operating within civilian infrastructure and exploiting Gaza’s civilian population - allegations which Hamas has previously denied.

Earlier this month, the UN Human Rights Office condemned what it called the "increasing frequency" of Israeli strikes on schools sheltering displaced people and accused the IDF of conducting them "with apparent disregard for the high rate of civilian fatalities".

The warning after [at least 70 Palestinians were killed in an air strike on al-Taba’een school in Gaza City](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8erk37yn2no)
, according to the director of a local hospital.

The IDF said the school had "served as an active Hamas and Islamic Jihad military facility", and that it had confirmed the identities of 31 "terrorists" who were killed.

The UN said at the time that it had been at least the 21st strike on a school serving as a shelter since 4 July and that they had resulted in at least 274 fatalities.

The US secretary of state discussed the ceasefire talks with Egypt's president

Also on Tuesday, the civil defence said five people had been killed in a strike on a house in Bureij refugee camp, in central Gaza, while Palestinian news agency Wafa cited medical sources as saying four had been killed in nearby Deir al-Balah.

The IDF said its troops and aircraft had "eliminated numerous terrorists" operating in central Gaza, including two who exited an underground tunnel and attempted to plant an explosive device.

It came as the US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, visited Egypt to continue to apply diplomatic pressure to try to secure a ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas.

The BBC's Tom Bateman, who is travelling with Mr Blinken, says the Americans hope for some sort of breakthrough within the next week or so, but that the mood on the ground in the region has not matched that expectation.

After talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday, Mr Blinken said Israel had accepted a US proposal aimed at bridging the remaining gaps between the warring parties.

But Hamas accused the US of "acquiescing" to what it called Mr Netanyahu's "new conditions".

! The group also criticised as misleading President Joe Biden’s claim that it seemed to be “backing away” from an agreement.

A major sticking point is Mr Netanyahu's insistence that Israeli troops remain in the Philadelphi corridor, a narrow strip of land running along Gaza’s border with Egypt, which Hamas has rejected.

He says it is necessary to prevent smuggling and Hamas rearming itself, but Hamas says it would amount to continued Israeli occupation and not an end to the war.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The provided evidence does not contain the image. The reverse image search only confirms the existence of the image. The web search results describe Israeli airstrikes in Gaza in July and August 2024, including strikes on schools. However, none of the articles include the image or confirm the specific details of the claim.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available information. More information is needed to confirm the image's context, including the child's identity, the location, and the cause of the rubble.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:59>

### Evidence from `web_search`
The CNN article from July 27, 2024, reports on an Israeli airstrike on a school in Deir-al Balah, central Gaza, on July 27, 2024, where at least 30 people were killed. The article does not include the image. ([https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/27/middleeast/israel-gaza-deir-al-balah-school-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/27/middleeast/israel-gaza-deir-al-balah-school-intl))

The BBC article from August 20, 2024, discusses an Israeli strike on a school in Gaza City, which was sheltering displaced people. ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9zxlpz5evo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9zxlpz5evo)) The Associated Press article from July 27, 2024, reports on an Israeli airstrike on a school in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza Strip, which killed at least 30 people, including children. ([https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-gaza-palestinians-evacuation-27-july-2024-c95e8effebd9d4e4ba7e69bfbae61e04](https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-gaza-palestinians-evacuation-27-july-2024-c95e8effebd9d4e4ba7e69bfbae61e04)) <image:k>


## Elaboration
The provided evidence does not contain the image. The reverse image search only confirms the existence of the image. The web search results describe Israeli airstrikes in Gaza in July and August 2024, including strikes on schools. However, none of the articles include the image or confirm the specific details of the claim.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available information. More information is needed to confirm the image's context, including the child's identity, the location, and the cause of the rubble.

### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.51, 'Israel': 0.24, 'Jordan': 0.11, 'Russia': 0.02, 'Canada': 0.01, 'Colombia': 0.01, 'France': 0.01, 'Sweden': 0.01, 'Turkey': 0.01, 'Ukraine': 0.01}

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image search provides additional images of children in rubble in Gaza, supporting the claim's general context. The geolocation data suggests the image was most likely taken in Palestine or Israel. However, the evidence still does not confirm the specific details of the claim, such as the exact date or the cause of the rubble.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified.

```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:59>

### Evidence from `web_search`
The CNN article from July 27, 2024, reports on an Israeli airstrike on a school in Deir-al Balah, central Gaza, on July 27, 2024, where at least 30 people were killed. The article does not include the image. ([https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/27/middleeast/israel-gaza-deir-al-balah-school-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/27/middleeast/israel-gaza-deir-al-balah-school-intl))

The BBC article from August 20, 2024, discusses an Israeli strike on a school in Gaza City, which was sheltering displaced people. ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9zxlpz5evo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9zxlpz5evo)) The Associated Press article from July 27, 2024, reports on an Israeli airstrike on a school in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza Strip, which killed at least 30 people, including children. ([https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-gaza-palestinians-evacuation-27-july-2024-c95e8effebd9d4e4ba7e69bfbae61e04](https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-gaza-palestinians-evacuation-27-july-2024-c95e8effebd9d4e4ba7e69bfbae61e04)) <image:k>


## Elaboration
The provided evidence does not contain the image. The reverse image search only confirms the existence of the image. The web search results describe Israeli airstrikes in Gaza in July and August 2024, including strikes on schools. However, none of the articles include the image or confirm the specific details of the claim.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available information. More information is needed to confirm the image's context, including the child's identity, the location, and the cause of the rubble.


## Actions
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The NBC News video shows rescue workers trying to save children trapped in the rubble after an airstrike in Gaza City. ([https://www.nbcnews.com/video/rescue-workers-fight-to-save-children-trapped-in-gaza-city-airstrike-rubble-196401733655](https://www.nbcnews.com/video/rescue-workers-fight-to-save-children-trapped-in-gaza-city-airstrike-rubble-196401733655)) <image:6780> Al Jazeera published an article about the impact of the war on children in Gaza, including an image of children amidst rubble.

### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.51, 'Israel': 0.24, 'Jordan': 0.11, 'Russia': 0.02, 'Canada': 0.01, 'Colombia': 0.01, 'France': 0.01, 'Sweden': 0.01, 'Turkey': 0.01, 'Ukraine': 0.01}

## Elaboration
The image search provides additional images of children in rubble in Gaza, supporting the claim's general context. The geolocation data suggests the image was most likely taken in Palestine or Israel. However, the evidence still does not confirm the specific details of the claim, such as the exact date or the cause of the rubble.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified.

The story behind the photograph of a starving Gaza baby
=======================================================

A photographer in Gaza has told the story of how he captured a series of harrowing photographs, showing an emaciated child.

Ahmed al-Arini told BBC Newshour that he wanted to "show the rest of the world extreme hunger" that babies and children are experiencing in the Gaza Strip.

Global food security experts have not yet classified the situation in Gaza as a famine, but UN agencies have warned of man-made, mass starvation taking hold.

They have blamed Israel, which controls all supplies entering the Palestinian territory, but it has denied responsibility.

Israel blames Hamas for any cases of malnutrition.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:59>

### Evidence from `web_search`
The CNN article from July 27, 2024, reports on an Israeli airstrike on a school in Deir-al Balah, central Gaza, on July 27, 2024, where at least 30 people were killed. The article does not include the image. ([https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/27/middleeast/israel-gaza-deir-al-balah-school-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/27/middleeast/israel-gaza-deir-al-balah-school-intl))

The BBC article from August 20, 2024, discusses an Israeli strike on a school in Gaza City, which was sheltering displaced people. ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9zxlpz5evo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9zxlpz5evo)) The Associated Press article from July 27, 2024, reports on an Israeli airstrike on a school in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza Strip, which killed at least 30 people, including children.

## Elaboration
The provided evidence does not contain the image. The reverse image search only confirms the existence of the image. The web search results describe Israeli airstrikes in Gaza in July and August 2024, including strikes on schools. However, none of the articles include the image or confirm the specific details of the claim.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available information. More information is needed to confirm the image's context, including the child's identity, the location, and the cause of the rubble.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The NBC News video shows rescue workers trying to save children trapped in the rubble after an airstrike in Gaza City. ([https://www.nbcnews.com/video/rescue-workers-fight-to-save-children-trapped-in-gaza-city-airstrike-rubble-196401733655](https://www.nbcnews.com/video/rescue-workers-fight-to-save-children-trapped-in-gaza-city-airstrike-rubble-196401733655)) <image:6780> Al Jazeera published an article about the impact of the war on children in Gaza, including an image of children amidst rubble. ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/19/israels-war-against-gazas-children-explained](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/19/israels-war-against-gazas-children-explained)) <image:6781> The NPR article includes an image of a woman sitting in rubble in Gaza.

### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.51, 'Israel': 0.24, 'Jordan': 0.11, 'Russia': 0.02, 'Canada': 0.01, 'Colombia': 0.01, 'France': 0.01, 'Sweden': 0.01, 'Turkey': 0.01, 'Ukraine': 0.01}

## Elaboration
The image search provides additional images of children in rubble in Gaza, supporting the claim's general context. The geolocation data suggests the image was most likely taken in Palestine or Israel. However, the evidence still does not confirm the specific details of the claim, such as the exact date or the cause of the rubble.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified.

Rabat – A disturbing leaked video came to light on Tuesday showing an Israeli police dog brutally attacking an elderly Palestinian woman inside her home during their raid of the Jabalia refugee camp several weeks ago.

The **[footage](https://www.instagram.com/p/C8rTeL6pF3M/?igsh=MWRhbzlyYm00Zjl4Ng==)
**, which was obtained by Al Jazeera, has sparked social media fury and widespread condemnation. Captured from a camera mounted on the dog, the video showed the 66-year-old woman screaming in terror as she was viciously attacked.

The elderly woman, identified as Dawlat Al Tanani, suffered severe injuries and fractures as a result of the brutal attack.

Speaking to Al Jazeera, she said that Israeli Occupation Forces (IOF) unleashed the dog on her because she was resisting eviction from her home.

“I refuse to be forced out of my house, nor will I abandon my home. So the Israelis set a dog on me, which bit me while I was sleeping in my bed. It dragged me and pulled me all the way to the entrance door,” the elderly woman said.

“Now I have a serious injury. There are no hospitals or anything to treat my injury. My hand is still untreated,” she added.

The incident has reinforced accusations against the IOF of perpetrating severe forms of torture and violence against civilians, contrasting sharply with its self-proclaimed status as “the most moral army in the world.”

Social media users have widely shared the video, expressing shock for the extent the IOF goes to inflict pain and suffering on Palestinians.

Many activists have pointed out that such actions, including the use of police dogs against civilians, have been a longstanding practice by the Israeli forces.

“Israel/Zionist Occupiers brutality clearly has no limits…training dogs to rape and attack Palestinians. The daily massacres (are) getting (more) gruesome by the day,” **[said](https://x.com/huda54112445811/status/1805989054044938370)

The IDF on Thursday refuted accusations that one of its canines attacked an old woman in Gaza. Qatar-based Al Jazeera published menacing photos showing the dog in an aggressive attack of the seemingly terrified resident of Jabaliya.

The military said one of its dogs was abducted by terrorists during the fighting in Gaza and was in their custody when the alleged attack occurred. It was later found killed and his body boobytrapped to explode on soldiers if they attempted to retrieve it.

A Paratrooper Division in search of terrorists sent the attack dog with its handler into a building where they were thought to be hiding. The dog did not return, nor were there sounds of struggle or explosions, the military told ynet. The troops set out to inspect the building remotely using drones. At first, the dog was nowhere to be found but it was later seen sprawled on the street.

The team managed to identify residual explosives coming from the dog's body. The explosives were removed from the dog, which was taken for burial in the canine cemetery in the Canine unit - Oketz base.

The footage published by Al-Jazeera includes segments from the camera installed on the dog, showing it attacking the elderly woman in her home. She appears to be struggling with the dog on her bed.

However, the IDF said that even though the dog shown in the video was indeed a member of the canine unit, it had been abducted by Hamas with its equipment.

"The incident occurred after the handler lost touch with his dog," the IDF said. "It never received orders to harm civilians." The military added that killing the dog and rigging its body was part of Hamas' cynical tactics.

The footage was passed on to Al-Jazeera by correspondent Anas Al Sharif, who covers the northern Gaza area and is affiliated with Hamas. He is a resident of Jabaliya whose home was bombed in an IDF attack, and his father was killed. He is known to accompany Hamas terrorists and document their battles in Jabaliya.

More than 100 dogs were deployed alongside Israeli forces during the aggression in Gaza that began in October 2023.

These dogs, part of the Oketz unit, have been lauded for their roles in military operations, with their stories often celebrated in Israeli media, just as stories of fallen or injured soldiers are shared.

But the celebration of these "warriors on four legs" glosses over the brutal reality of their involvement in the conflict.

Dogs from the Oketz unit played a key role in military raids, such as the attack on 70-year-old Dawlat al-Tanani in Jabalia camp, where one of the unit’s dogs savagely mauled her.

Another horrific incident occurred when a dog fatally attacked 24-year-old Mohammed Salah Bahar, a young man with Down syndrome, in his home in Gaza’s Shuja’iyya neighborhood.

History of Training
-------------------

The Oketz unit, known for its specialized training of attack dogs, has been increasingly deployed in operations against Palestinian civilians and prisoners.

Their role, however, has extended beyond Gaza. The dogs have reportedly been used in Israeli prisons, and there have been disturbing allegations of their involvement in torture.

A prisoner named Muhammad Arab, held in the Sde Teiman prison, reported that dogs were trained to assault detainees sexually, adding another layer of brutality to the treatment of prisoners under Israeli occupation.

The use of military dogs in this context is not new, but its intensification reflects a broader pattern of violence.

Since before the Nakba in 1948, dogs have played a role in the Zionist project’s colonial control over Palestinians.

The glorification of these "warriors on all fours" in Israeli media serves to mask their role in the ongoing suppression of Palestinians, a history that traces back decades and continues to evolve in the current conflict.

Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, military dogs were notably absent from the Israeli army's ranks, even as Jewish settlers brought new European breeds to Palestine in the wake of “Israel’s” establishment.

In 1974, the Israeli Occupation discreetly revived its military dog unit, although it remained largely secret for more than a decade.

This renewed focus on dogs was closely tied to the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which began in 1967.

As Israeli forces faced growing resistance from Palestinian guerrilla fighters, the army saw a need for trained dogs to assist with intelligence and counterinsurgency missions.

Unit 7142, the newly reconstituted dog unit, played a key role in supporting Military Intelligence Unit 269, later known as Sayeret Matkal, one of the Israeli occupation's most elite special forces units.

Trained dogs were deployed to assist in countering what the Israeli occupation referred to as "terrorist activity," which in practice often meant confronting Palestinian guerrillas.

Despite its early successes, Israeli military leadership remained divided on the effectiveness of military dogs. Unit 7142 continued to operate under the radar, with doubts about the "colonial dog" and its utility in official army units lingering within the higher ranks.

Weaponizing Dogs
----------------

Since the Israeli aggression on Gaza began on October 7, more than 100 dogs have played an integral role in Israeli operations in Gaza. Since the beginning of the war, dogs from this unit have worked alongside Israeli paratroopers and other forces.

According to a report by Yoav Zitun on the Ynet website, over 30 dogs from the unit have been killed, many due to explosives or gunfire.

Despite these losses, the unit’s size is expected to double in the coming years, as the army recognizes the tactical value of the dogs in Gaza.

The Oketz unit employs dogs equipped with advanced technology for both military operations and acts of retaliation.

On the battlefield, these dogs are trained to alert soldiers to potential dangers, such as explosives, and to scout sites like destroyed buildings or displaced homes.

One of their key roles is the detection of tunnels used by Palestinian resistance fighters. Equipped with cameras and eavesdropping devices, these dogs are often sent into tunnels ahead of human troops.

Sometimes, they even carry gas bombs that are triggered if the dog detects someone inside, turning the animal into a sacrificial tool.

Yet beyond these security functions, the dogs have also been deployed in brutal retaliatory actions.

The unit uses attack dogs—specifically trained German Shepherds and Dobermanns—whose role is to maul and kill humans.

There have been numerous reports of dogs attacking civilians, including graphic accounts of an elderly woman, Dawlat al-Tanani, in Jabalia camp, whose chest was torn apart by a military dog.

Testimonies from Gaza also describe how these dogs have been used as tools of psychological terror.

According to Fadi, a detainee released from the Sde Teiman camp, Israeli soldiers forced prisoners to endure sexual assaults by trained dogs.

Fadi’s testimony is one of many that highlight the level of dehumanization experienced by Palestinians during the war, with trained dogs playing a central role in this violence.

The story of a booby-trapped dog further underscores the grim interplay between human and canine sacrifice in this conflict.

This militarization of dogs in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict represents a deeper level of brutality, as these animals are used not only for tactical purposes but also as instruments of terror and revenge.![Israeli-reservists-pose-with-a-dog-they-brought-out-of-Gaza-in-December-2023.-Courtesy-of-Glass-Walls.jpg (1600×1000)](https://static.timesofisrael.com/www/uploads/2024/01/Israeli-reservists-pose-with-a-dog-they-brought-out-of-Gaza-in-December-2023.-Courtesy-of-Glass-Walls.jpg)

Striking Violations
-------------------

Last week, the Israeli newspaper _Haaretz_ released disturbing footage from Megiddo Prison, revealing scenes of abuse against Palestinian prisoners.

In the leaked video, inmates in the prison’s security wing were shown lying on the ground, hands bound, as a guard walked over them with a dog, an apparent act of humiliation.

The use of dogs as a tool for abuse has been a longstanding concern for human rights groups.

In June, the Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor issued a report highlighting the Israeli military’s deployment of police dogs in the Gaza Strip.

According to the report, these dogs are used not only in military operations but also to terrorize prisoners, subjecting them to mauling and, in some instances, sexual violence.

The organization documented numerous cases of dog attacks on civilians during Israeli raids, particularly on homes, hospitals, and shelters.

In some operations, the dogs are equipped with surveillance cameras to scout locations ahead of Israeli soldiers.

Civilians are often left defenseless as the dogs are set upon them, with soldiers standing by or even encouraging the attacks. This behavior has drawn international condemnation.

Jeremy Laurence, a spokesperson for the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, has called such actions "serious violations" of “Israel's legal obligations toward protected persons under the law of occupation.”

One particularly harrowing case involved Mohammed Bahar, a 24-year-old Palestinian man with Down syndrome.

During a military raid on Gaza’s Shuja’iyya neighborhood last July, a police dog attacked Bahar as he sat on a couch.

His mother recounted the brutal incident to Anadolu Agency, describing how the dog bit her son multiple times, causing fatal injuries.

In another incident from May, widely shared on social media, a police dog attacked 70-year-old Dawlat al-Tanani during an Israeli military operation in Jabalia camp, severely injuring her arm.

Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor has also documented the use of dogs in assaults on hospitals, including one attack in 2023 where dogs were unleashed on displaced civilians and even the bodies of the deceased. Another documented case occurred during an invasion of the Al-Shifa Medical Complex in March 2024.

The practice of using police dogs has not been limited to Gaza. In the West Bank, reports indicate a growing number of incidents in which dogs have been deployed during arrests and house raids, particularly against children.

WAFA, the Palestinian News Agency, has shared dozens of photos and videos showing soldiers setting dogs on civilians.

Human rights groups have labeled these attacks as a form of torture and degrading treatment, prohibited under international law.

Protests against this practice have spread beyond the region. On September 16, activists in the Netherlands demonstrated outside a K-9 training center in Oosterhout, demanding a halt to the export of police dogs to the Israeli military, which they claim are being used to target civilians.

The ongoing use of dogs in military operations has become a symbol of the broader human rights concerns surrounding Israel’s occupation, adding to the mounting calls for international accountability.

![Israeli-Army-Attack-with-Dog](/cached_uploads/resize/400/200/alhaq_files/images/stories/Images/Israeli-Army-Attack-with-Dog.jpg "An archived photo for illustration purposes of an Israeli army dog attacking  a Palestinian woman during an army raid in the West Bank village of Obadiyah, near Bethlehem. During last week, a woman and her 17-year-old son were attacked during an arrest operation.

### Amira Rahman ‘Awad

On 21 December, Israeli occupying forces unleashed an army dog on 47-year-old Amira Rahman ‘Awad during a raid on her sons’ house in Ithna, Hebron. In some cases, computers, documents and money are “confiscated” and furniture is destroyed.

House raids are also used by Israel as tactics of harassment, as was the case during the week of 14 – 20 November when the Israeli army raided the houses of Palestinian ex-prisoners to let them know they were being watched. The soldiers then called on Amira’s 17-year-old son Jarallah who went inside the house to put more clothes on.

Moments after the door to the house was wide open, the Israeli soldiers let loose an army dog described by Amira as being big and similar looking to a wolf. His demands were dismissed and no names were given to him.

Amira’s son Samer was released the next day at around 3:30 pm.

This week alone, tens of houses were raided during arrest operations in Jenin refugee camp and the village of Yatma, south of Nablus.

The arbitrary arrest and detention of Palestinians in the Occupied Palestinian Territory continues to infringe upon their human rights. The events took place at around 1:20 am when Israeli soldiers stormed into Amira’s house and threatened to bombard her sons’ house located across from hers. According to Amira, the soldiers came to arrest her eldest son Samer Issa ‘Awad (24 years old) who had served an eight-year sentence in an Israeli prison for being an active member of Hamas.

Issa Muhammad ‘Awad, Amira’s husband told the soldiers that his son Samer was sick but will be right down nonetheless."

An Israeli army dog mauled a pregnant Palestinian woman.  

In December, Tel Aviv University shared a video on social media revealing the establishment of an “engineering war room” on its campus to support Israeli military operations.

The facility has been developing technologies for the army, including a live-streaming system for [dog-mounted cameras](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/tel-aviv-university-developed-dog-cameras-army-unit-linked-gaza-attacks)

But when the house suddenly lit up, they realised it wasn’t soldiers, but a dog, with a light and a camera on its head, entering each room in the house.  

The dog broke through the door and attacked her 17-year-old sister, who was seven-months pregnant."

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

The increase in consumer demands has resulted in a sharp increase in digital financing in India. However, the image is misleading as it was created using Artificial Intelligence (AI), as indicated by its graphical elements, watermark ("IN.VISUALART"), and basic anomalies. Although there are  certain reports regarding the real incident in several news channels, the viral image was not taken during the actual event. <image:6893>
