JetBlue Airways changed Israel's borders and labeled the area as "Palestinian Territories" on its in-flight map, which sparked outrage. This incident, which occurred in September 2024, was reported by The Jerusalem Post ([https://www.jpost.com/diaspora/article-818656](https://www.jpost.com/diaspora/article-818656)) and The Times of Israel ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/air-canada-blames-display-issue-after-in-flight-map-of-israel-relabeled-as-palestinian-territories/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/air-canada-blames-display-issue-after-in-flight-map-of-israel-relabeled-as-palestinian-territories/)). JetBlue stated that the map was provided by a third-party company.

JetBlue was forced to change its in-flight maps and has dumped its current vendor.
