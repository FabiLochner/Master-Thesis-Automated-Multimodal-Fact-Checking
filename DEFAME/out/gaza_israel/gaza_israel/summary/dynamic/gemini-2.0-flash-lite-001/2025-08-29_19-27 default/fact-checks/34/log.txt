## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (<image:23>) shows a fire at an oil refinery near Tehran. The Times of Israel ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/huge-fire-at-refinery-near-tehran-extinguished-after-20-hours-report/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/huge-fire-at-refinery-near-tehran-extinguished-after-20-hours-report/)), The Globe and Mail ([https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-massive-fire-breaks-out-at-oil-refinery-south-of-tehran/](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-massive-fire-breaks-out-at-oil-refinery-south-of-tehran/)), and The New Arab ([https://www.newarab.com/news/massive-fire-breaks-out-oil-refinery-near-irans-capital](https://www.newarab.com/news/massive-fire-breaks-out-oil-refinery-near-irans-capital)) all used the image in articles published on June 2, 2021, about the fire. The fire was caused by a liquefied gas line leak and explosion.


### Evidence from `web_search`
Multiple news sources, including CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-strikes-lebanon-gaza-war-10-26-24](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-strikes-lebanon-gaza-war-10-26-24)), NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2024/10/25/nx-s1-5165574/israel-iran-airstrikes-tehran](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/25/nx-s1-5165574/israel-iran-airstrikes-tehran)), and The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/26/idf-israel-iran-strikes-explosions-tehran](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/26/idf-israel-iran-strikes-explosions-tehran)), reported on Israeli airstrikes against military targets in Iran on October 26, 2024, in retaliation for attacks against Israel. <image:23>, <image:1274>, <image:1275>, <image:1277>, <image:1282>

The articles mention explosions in Tehran and nearby Karaj, with the IDF stating the attacks were a response to previous attacks. The CNN article also mentions that four Iranian military members died in the attack.


## Elaboration
The claim is partially false. The image depicts a fire at an oil refinery near Tehran, which occurred on June 2, 2021, and was caused by a gas leak and explosion. However, on October 26, 2024, there were reports of Israeli airstrikes in Tehran.


## Final Judgement
The image is from a 2021 fire, while the claim refers to events in 2024. Although there were reports of Israeli airstrikes in Tehran on October 26, 2024, the image does not depict this event. Therefore, the claim is misleading. `false`
