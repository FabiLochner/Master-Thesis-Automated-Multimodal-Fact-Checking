Useful result: From [Source](https://www.cyberpeace.org/resources/blogs/factcheck---debunking-the-ai-generated-image-of-an-alleged-israeli-army-dog-attack): 
Content: The Cyberpeace Institute fact-checked an image of an Israeli Army dog attacking an elderly Palestinian woman and found it to be AI-generated and fake. The article was published on July 15, 2024. The image contains a watermark "IN.VISUALART" and has graphical anomalies. <image:6892>, <image:6893>, <image:6894>, <image:6895>, <image:6896>.

The claim '<image:65> This is an authentic image of an elderly Palestinian women being attacked by an Israeli army dog in June 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. The image depicting an Israeli army dog attacking an elderly Palestinian woman is digitally altered, as confirmed by the Cyberpeace Institute's fact-check. While there are documented instances of such attacks, the specific image is not authentic.

So, the overall veracity is: false
