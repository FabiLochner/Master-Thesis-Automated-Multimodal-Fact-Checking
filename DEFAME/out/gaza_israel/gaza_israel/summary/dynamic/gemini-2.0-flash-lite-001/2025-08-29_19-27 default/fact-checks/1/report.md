web_search("Myanmar earthquake March 28 2025")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources discuss the 2025 Myanmar earthquake that occurred on March 28, 2025. One source, from Wikipedia, describes the earthquake as having a magnitude of 7.7-7.9, with the epicenter near Mandalay, resulting in 5,456 fatalities, 11,404 injuries, and 538 missing. The article also mentions the impact of the Myanmar civil war and international humanitarian efforts. Another source, from ScienceDirect, mentions the earthquake had a magnitude of Mw 7.7 and struck along the Sagaing Fault. A third source, from Phys.org, reports a magnitude 7.8 earthquake on the same date, causing widespread damage and over 5,000 casualties, with a rupture extending about 480 kilometers along the Sagaing Fault.

The sources are: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Myanmar_earthquake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Myanmar_earthquake), [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2950576325000017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2950576325000017), and [https://phys.org/news/2025-07-myanmar-earthquake-fault-rupture-exceeded.html](https://phys.org/news/2025-07-myanmar-earthquake-fault-rupture-exceeded.html).


## Elaboration
The provided web search results confirm the existence of a 7.7-7.9 magnitude earthquake in Myanmar on March 28, 2025, which aligns with the date and magnitude mentioned in the claim. The search results also describe the widespread damage and casualties caused by the earthquake.

However, the evidence does not include the image. Therefore, I cannot verify if the image depicts the ruins after the 2025 Myanmar earthquake.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The image search results provide images of the damage caused by the 2025 Myanmar earthquake. Britannica.com ([https://www.britannica.com/event/Myanmar-earthquake-of-2025](https://www.britannica.com/event/Myanmar-earthquake-of-2025)) includes an image of the damage ![image 5840](media/2025-08-29_19-29-1756495756-697344.jpg). The New York Times ([https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/world/asia/earthquake-myanmar-thailand-death-toll.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/world/asia/earthquake-myanmar-thailand-death-toll.html)) also features an image of the damage ![image 5841](media/2025-08-29_19-29-1756495758-763201.jpg). Additionally, the United Nations University (unu.edu) has an image of building damage from the earthquake ![image 5842](media/2025-08-29_19-29-1756495759-026201.jpg).


## Elaboration
The image search results provide images of the damage caused by the 2025 Myanmar earthquake. However, none of the images match the one in the claim. Therefore, I cannot verify that the image in the claim depicts the ruins after the 7.9-magnitude earthquake in Myanmar on March 28, 2025.


## Final Judgement
The search results confirm the occurrence of a 7.7-7.9 magnitude earthquake in Myanmar on March 28, 2025, as stated in the claim. However, the image search did not return the same image as the one in the claim. Therefore, the image cannot be verified as depicting the ruins after the earthquake.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is unverified. While the existence of a 7.7-7.9 magnitude earthquake in Myanmar on March 28, 2025, is confirmed by multiple sources ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Myanmar_earthquake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Myanmar_earthquake), [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2950576325000017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2950576325000017), and [https://phys.org/news/2025-07-myanmar-earthquake-fault-rupture-exceeded.html](https://phys.org/news/2025-07-myanmar-earthquake-fault-rupture-exceeded.html)), the image search did not return the same image as the one in the claim, making it impossible to verify the image's origin.
