## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
An article from the Atlantic Council, published on March 18, 2025, discusses the US approach toward the Houthis, mentioning that Trump ordered airstrikes against Yemen’s Houthi rebels on March 15, 2025, in response to attacks on Red Sea shipping. The article also mentions that Russia has aided Houthi operations.

An ABC News article from July 8, 2025, reports that Houthi rebels attacked ships in the Red Sea, killing mariners. The attacks are the first since late 2024, when Trump's administration targeted the rebels in airstrikes. The Wikipedia article on the Red Sea crisis includes a timeline of events, including Houthi attacks on commercial vessels and military operations. It mentions a 2025 U.S.–Houthi ceasefire and a statement by Yahya Saree that they would target ships heading to Israeli ports in the Mediterranean Sea. On May 6, 2024, Donald Trump announced a cessation of US strikes as a result of a bilateral ceasefire between the US and the Houthis.

## Elaboration
The evidence contradicts the claim. The Atlantic Council article indicates that Trump ordered airstrikes against the Houthis in March 2025, and ABC News reported Houthi attacks in the Red Sea in July 2025. The Wikipedia article mentions a 2025 U.S.–Houthi ceasefire, but also that the Houthis stated they would target ships heading to Israeli ports in the Mediterranean Sea. Furthermore, the evidence indicates that Trump announced a cessation of US strikes on May 6, 2024, as a result of a bilateral ceasefire.


## Final Judgement
The evidence suggests that the Houthis did not cease military operations in international waters after Trump won the 2024 US presidential election. Instead, there were continued attacks and counter-attacks, including airstrikes ordered by Trump in 2025. While there was a ceasefire announced in May 2024, it was not a final cessation of military operations.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. Evidence from the Atlantic Council ([https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/trump-should-not-forget-the-russian-hand-behind-the-houthis/](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/trump-should-not-forget-the-russian-hand-behind-the-houthis/)) and ABC News ([https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/yemens-houthi-rebels-attack-ship-red-sea-killing-123559774](https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/yemens-houthi-rebels-attack-ship-red-sea-killing-123559774)) indicates that Houthi military operations continued after Trump's election, including attacks on ships and U.S. airstrikes in 2025. While a ceasefire was announced in May 2024, it did not represent a final cessation of hostilities.
