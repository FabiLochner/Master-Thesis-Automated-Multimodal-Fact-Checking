Justification: The Israeli ambassador to Ethiopia, Avraham Neguise, was removed from an African Union conference in Addis Ababa on April 7, 2025, as reported by [Tasnim News Agency](https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2025/04/07/3286985/israeli-ambassador-removed-from-african-union-meeting), [peoplesdispatch.org](https://peoplesdispatch.org/2025/04/08/israeli-diplomat-booted-from-au-conference-on-rwandan-genocide/), and [Ethiopia Observer](https://www.ethiopiaobserver.com/2025/04/07/israeli-ambassador-to-ethiopia-expelled-from-african-union-headquarters-despite-invite/). However, the sources do not explicitly state that Ethiopia expelled the ambassador.

So, the overall veracity is: false
