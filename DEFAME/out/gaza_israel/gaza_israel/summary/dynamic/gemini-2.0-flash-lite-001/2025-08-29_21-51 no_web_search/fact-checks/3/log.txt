Content: The article from Pattaya Mail, published on August 6, 2025, discusses a controversy surrounding Israeli tourists in Pai, Thailand. The article includes an image <image:3463> of Israeli tourists and states that the tourists clarified their visit to Pai was for tourism and to experience the local culture, not to claim land or compete with Thai professions. The article also mentions Chabad centers and recent disturbances caused by a small group of Israelis, with the tourists expressing regret and urging future visitors to be respectful. The article also contains the exact image provided in the claim <image:4>.

The claim '<image:4> This image shows Israelis who have stopped fighting the wars in Gaza and Lebanon and moved to become 'settlers' in Pai District, Mae Hong Son Province, Thailand, in February 2025.' is false.
Justification: The image in the claim was used in articles discussing Israelis in Pai, Thailand, as confirmed by a reverse image search, supporting the location aspect of the claim. However, the claim that they moved to become 'settlers' cannot be verified with the provided evidence.

So, the overall veracity is: false
