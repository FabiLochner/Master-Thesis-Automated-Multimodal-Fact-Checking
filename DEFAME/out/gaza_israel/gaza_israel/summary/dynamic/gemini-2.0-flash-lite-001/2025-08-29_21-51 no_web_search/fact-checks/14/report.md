From [Source](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/etimes/trending/what-normal-toilet-seat-explodes-in-noida-home-and-why-this-may-happen-anywhere/articleshow/121126061.cms): Found exact image on website with title: What! Normal toilet seat explodes in Noida home! And why this may ...
Content: The Times of India published an article on May 14, 2025, discussing a case where a toilet exploded in a home in Noida, India. ![image 12](media/14.jpg) The article attributes the explosion to a methane gas buildup from a clogged drain.


### Evidence from `image_search`
NPR reported on Hezbollah pagers exploding across Lebanon in September 2024, causing nearly 3,000 casualties (![image 7467](media/2025-08-29_21-54-1756504446-046095.jpg)). CNN also covered the attack (![image 7468](media/2025-08-29_21-54-1756504446-241935.jpg)). The Guardian published an article on September 17, 2024, about an incident in Lebanon where hundreds of Hezbollah members were hurt (![image 7469](media/2025-08-29_21-54-1756504446-424893.jpg)).

## Elaboration
The claim is false. The image shows a toilet that exploded in Noida, India, due to a methane gas buildup, not a Hezbollah pager explosion in Lebanon. The Times of India published an article about the incident on May 14, 2025.


## Final Judgement
The image shows a toilet explosion in Noida, India, caused by methane gas buildup, not a Hezbollah pager explosion in Lebanon. The claim misrepresents the origin and context of the image.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image depicts a toilet explosion in Noida, India, as reported by the Times of India, and is unrelated to the Hezbollah pager explosions in Lebanon in September 2024, which were covered by sources like NPR and CNN.
