## Elaboration
The evidence includes an image of Esmail Qaani and an image of a man in an Israeli military uniform. The Times of Israel reports on claims about Esmail Qaani. However, there is no direct evidence confirming that Esmail Qaani has fled to Israel.

The search results do not provide any information about the date of April 2025.

Insufficient information is available to verify the claim.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/10/iran-esmail-ghaani-al-quds-beirut-lebanon-israeli-strikes-hezbollah): 
Content: The Guardian published an article on October 10, 2024, featuring an image of Esmail Qaani ![image 7714](media/2025-08-29_22-01-1756504864-147571.jpg).


## Elaboration
The new evidence from the image search includes an article from The Guardian featuring an image of Esmail Qaani. However, this evidence does not provide any information about Qaani fleeing Iran or being in Israel. The article is dated October 10, 2024, which is before the claimed date of April 2025.

The evidence continues to be insufficient to verify the claim.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
Livemint reports on claims that Esmail Qaani was killed in an Israeli strike ([https://www.livemint.com/news/irans-quds-force-commander-esmail-qaani-killed-in-israeli-strike-reports-say-who-was-he-11749833415067.html](https://www.livemint.com/news/irans-quds-force-commander-esmail-qaani-killed-in-israeli-strike-reports-say-who-was-he-11749833415067.html)) ![image 7720](media/2025-08-29_22-01-1756504872-962605.jpg). The Washington Institute provides an image of Esmail Qaani ([https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/qaanis-growing-leadership-struggles-post-soleimani-world](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/qaanis-growing-leadership-struggles-post-soleimani-world)) ![image 7722](media/2025-08-29_22-01-1756504873-409121.jpg).


## Elaboration
The latest evidence includes reports of claims that Esmail Qaani was killed in an Israeli strike. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that he fled to Israel and is safe there. The evidence contradicts the claim, as it suggests Qaani may have been killed.

The claim is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The search results provide images of Esmail Qaani and reports about him, including claims of his death. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that he fled Iran and is safe in Israel. The evidence contradicts the claim.

The claim is demonstrably false because the evidence suggests Qaani may have been killed, and there is no evidence of him fleeing to Israel. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The evidence, including reports from Livemint ([https://www.livemint.com/news/irans-quds-force-commander-esmail-qaani-killed-in-israeli-strike-reports-say-who-was-he-11749833415067.html](https://www.livemint.com/news/irans-quds-force-commander-esmail-qaani-killed-in-israeli-strike-reports-say-who-was-he-11749833415067.html)), indicates claims of Esmail Qaani's death in an Israeli strike, and there is no evidence to support the claim that he fled to Israel. Therefore, the claim is demonstrably false.
