Useful result: From [Source](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/world/hezbollah-drone-cracked-bedroom-window-at-netanyahu-home/news-story/3b37d4cf0972207541b284a416b09e8d): 
Content: The Australian reports that a Hezbollah drone cracked a bedroom window at Netanyahu's home. <image:7791>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.siasat.com/hezbollah-drone-flies-over-films-netanyahus-residence-report-3080894/): 
Content: The article from Siasat.com reports that a Hezbollah drone filmed Benjamin Netanyahu's residence. <image:7792>

The claim '<image:53> This image shows Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu's house taken by a Hezbollah drone in August 2024.' is false.
Justification: The image in the claim is of Benjamin Netanyahu's house, but it predates the claim, appearing in a 2020 article by _Times of Israel_ and a 2019 YouTube video, thus disproving the assertion that it was taken by a Hezbollah drone in August 2024.

So, the overall veracity is: false
