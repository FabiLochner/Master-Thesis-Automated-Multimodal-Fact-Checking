### Evidence from `image_search`
The National Herald ([https://www.thenationalherald.com/biden-family-attend-christmas-tree-lighting-on-nantucket/](https://www.thenationalherald.com/biden-family-attend-christmas-tree-lighting-on-nantucket/)) and Fox News ([https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-seen-holding-anti-israel-book-black-friday-shopping-excursion](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-seen-holding-anti-israel-book-black-friday-shopping-excursion)) published images of Joe Biden exiting Nantucket Bookworks. ![image 7574](media/2025-08-29_21-57-1756504642-896672.jpg) ![image 7575](media/2025-08-29_21-57-1756504643-041301.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Joe Biden was seen exiting Nantucket Bookworks. The National Herald ([https://www.thenationalherald.com/biden-family-attend-christmas-tree-lighting-on-nantucket/](https://www.thenationalherald.com/biden-family-attend-christmas-tree-lighting-on-nantucket/)) and Fox News ([https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-seen-holding-anti-israel-book-black-friday-shopping-excursion](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-seen-holding-anti-israel-book-black-friday-shopping-excursion)) published images of the event.

However, the evidence does not confirm whether the image shows Joe Biden holding a copy of Rashid Khalidi's book. The evidence also does not confirm the date of the event.

Therefore, the claim is partially verifiable. More information is needed to confirm the book and the date.

The New York Post published an article stating that Joe Biden picked up Rashid Khalidi's book, "The Hundred Years' War on Palestine: A History of Settler Colonialism and Resistance, 1917–2017" ([https://nypost.com/2024/11/29/us-news/biden-picks-up-anti-israel-book-during-black-friday-shopping-4-years-too-late-says-author/](https://nypost.com/2024/11/29/us-news/biden-picks-up-anti-israel-book-during-black-friday-shopping-4-years-too-late-says-author/)).

The claim is now fully verifiable.
