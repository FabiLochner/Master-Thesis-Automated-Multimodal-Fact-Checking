Content: The search result from [Source](https://unu.edu/inweh/collection/building-damage-assessment-march-2025-myanmar-earthquake) contains an image of an excavator working in the rubble. <image:7437>

The claim '<image:2> This image shows the ruins after a 7.9-magnitude earthquake in Myanmar on March 28, 2025.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not entirely accurate. While an earthquake did occur in Myanmar on March 28, 2025, as confirmed by sources like the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/world/asia/earthquake-myanmar-thailand-death-toll.html) and [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/event/Myanmar-earthquake-of-2025), the provided image is not directly confirmed by the search results.

So, the overall veracity is: false
