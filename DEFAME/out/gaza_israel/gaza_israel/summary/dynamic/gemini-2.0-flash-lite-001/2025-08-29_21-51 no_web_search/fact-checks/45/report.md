Ynetnews published an article titled "Greta Thunberg â€” from climate warrior to Israel hater" discussing Thunberg's shift towards anti-Israel activism. The Ecologist published an article titled "Greta stands with Gaza" on November 3, 2023, which includes the image of Thunberg holding the sign.

## Elaboration
The image of Greta Thunberg holding the sign is authentic. The Ecologist published the image on November 3, 2023, and The Telegraph published a video of Greta Thunberg saying "f--- Israel" at a demonstration. The Guardian also published an article about Greta Thunberg joining an aid ship sailing to Gaza.

The claim states the image is from November 2024, but the evidence suggests the image was published in November 2023. Therefore, the claim is partially inaccurate.


## Final Judgement
The image is authentic, but the claim about the date is inaccurate. The image was published in November 2023, not November 2024. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image of Greta Thunberg holding a sign that says "FUCK ISRAEL" is authentic, as evidenced by its appearance in articles from The Ecologist ([https://theecologist.org/2023/nov/03/greta-stands-gaza](https://theecologist.org/2023/nov/03/greta-stands-gaza)) and The Telegraph ([https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/12/10/watch-greta-thunberg-declares-f-israel-german-demonstration/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/12/10/watch-greta-thunberg-declares-f-israel-german-demonstration/)). However, the claim that the image is from November 2024 is inaccurate, as the image was published in November 2023.
