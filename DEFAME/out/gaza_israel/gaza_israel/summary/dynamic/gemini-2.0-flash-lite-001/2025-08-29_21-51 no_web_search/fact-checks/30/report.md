## Actions
```
image_search("BBC Hamas Bibas family Israel")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include a BBC News image of the Bibas family (![image 7508](media/2025-08-29_21-55-1756504539-706504.jpg)), an ABC News article from February 19, 2025, about Hamas releasing the remains of the Bibas family (![image 7509](media/2025-08-29_21-55-1756504539-976092.jpg)), and a Guardian article from January 31, 2025, about Hamas releasing Israeli hostage Yarden Bibas, his wife, and children (![image 7510](media/2025-08-29_21-55-1756504540-099199.jpg)).

The BBC News image is available at [Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czdnp4ly5d1o). The ABC News article is available at [Source](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-19/hamas-to-release-remains-of-bibas-family-israel/104953098). The Guardian article is available at [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/31/hamas-to-release-israeli-hostage-yarden-bibas-wife-children-family).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms the existence of a BBC News image related to the Bibas family, as well as ABC News and Guardian articles about the family. However, the evidence does not contain the specific BBC article mentioned in the claim.

The claim states that the BBC article's title is "Hamas just wanted to protect the Bibas family but Israel killed them - Hamas said." The search results do not provide the title of the BBC article.

Therefore, the veracity of the claim cannot be fully determined without the actual BBC article.
