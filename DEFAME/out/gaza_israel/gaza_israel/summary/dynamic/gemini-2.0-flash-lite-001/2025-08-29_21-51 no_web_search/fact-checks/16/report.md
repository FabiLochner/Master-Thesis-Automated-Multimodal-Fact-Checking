## Claim
Claim: "![image 14](media/16.jpg) This image shows the Israeli Olympic team spelling out 'Bring Them Home' at the 2024 Olympic games because they were not allowed to wear their yellow 'Bring Them Home' pins."

## Actions
```
image_search("Israeli Olympic team Bring Them Home")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.ynetnews.com/culture/article/skmg5e5ma): 
Content: The search result from Ynetnews.com contains an image of synchronized swimmers. ![image 763](media/2025-07-18_21-58-1752875926-305092.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence shows an image of synchronized swimmers, which aligns with the image in the claim. However, the evidence does not confirm the claim that the image shows the Israeli Olympic team spelling out "Bring Them Home" at the 2024 Olympic games. The evidence also does not mention anything about the team not being allowed to wear yellow "Bring Them Home" pins.

More information is needed to verify the claim.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The image shows synchronized swimmers spelling out "Bring Them Home Now". According to WCNC.com, the image is not from the Olympics ([https://www.wcnc.com/video/news/verify/olympics-verify/israel-swim-team-bring-them-home-now-image-not-from-olympics-video/536-9ef735d9-23f4-4928-9611-d6607538e54f](https://www.wcnc.com/video/news/verify/olympics-verify/israel-swim-team-bring-them-home-now-image-not-from-olympics-video/536-9ef735d9-23f4-4928-9611-d6607538e54f)). The New York Times published an article about synchronized swimming at the Olympics ([https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/us/synchronized-swimming-olympics.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/us/synchronized-swimming-olympics.html)). ![image 7470](media/2025-08-29_21-54-1756504454-661102.jpg), ![image 7471](media/2025-08-29_21-54-1756504454-923840.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the image of synchronized swimmers spelling out "Bring Them Home Now" is not from the Olympics. The WCNC.com article explicitly states this. Therefore, the claim that the image shows the Israeli Olympic team at the 2024 Olympic games is false.
