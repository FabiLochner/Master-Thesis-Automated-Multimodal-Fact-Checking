## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/rabbinate-dna-tests-seek-jewishness-in-the-blood-become-a-bone-of-contention/): 
Content: The Times of Israel discusses the use of DNA tests in Israel. ![image 7597](media/2025-08-29_21-58-1756504684-835180.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence from The Times of Israel ([Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/rabbinate-dna-tests-seek-jewishness-in-the-blood-become-a-bone-of-contention/)) discusses the use of DNA tests in Israel. However, the article does not mention whether it is illegal to do a DNA test in Israel.

Therefore, I cannot verify the claim. More information is needed to determine the legality of DNA tests in Israel.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include a discussion about DNA tests in Israel from the Israel Democracy Institute ([Source](https://en.idi.org.il/articles/26956)) ![image 7603](media/2025-08-29_21-58-1756504697-066192.jpg). The Law Office in Israel discusses Aliyah to Israel by DNA test ([Source](https://lawoffice.org.il/en/aliyah-to-israel-by-dna-test/)) ![image 7604](media/2025-08-29_21-58-1756504699-313591.jpg). Another source from Blaer Law ([Source](https://blaerlaw.com/en/judaism-israel-and-dna-or-how-to-obtain-israeli-citizenship-if-documents-are-not-in-order/)) is also included.


## Elaboration
The new evidence indicates that DNA tests are discussed in the context of Israeli law and procedures, specifically regarding Aliyah (immigration) and establishing Jewish identity. The Israel Democracy Institute ([Source](https://en.idi.org.il/articles/26956)), the Law Office in Israel ([Source](https://lawoffice.org.il/en/aliyah-to-israel-by-dna-test/)), and Blaer Law ([Source](https://blaerlaw.com/en/judaism-israel-and-dna-or-how-to-obtain-israeli-citizenship-if-documents-are-not-in-order/)) all mention DNA tests.

However, none of the provided sources explicitly state that it is illegal to conduct a DNA test in Israel. They focus on the use of DNA tests within legal frameworks, such as immigration and religious identity.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified. The evidence suggests that DNA tests are used and regulated in Israel, but not that they are illegal.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that DNA tests are discussed in the context of Israeli law, particularly concerning immigration and establishing Jewish identity. However, the provided sources do not explicitly state that it is illegal to conduct a DNA test in Israel.

The claim is not supported by the evidence. The evidence suggests that DNA tests are used and regulated in Israel, but not that they are illegal. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim that it is illegal to do a DNA test in Israel is not supported by the evidence. While DNA tests are discussed in the context of Israeli law, particularly regarding immigration and establishing Jewish identity, none of the provided sources explicitly state that it is illegal to conduct a DNA test in Israel. The sources, including those from the Israel Democracy Institute ([Source](https://en.idi.org.il/articles/26956)), the Law Office in Israel ([Source](https://lawoffice.org.il/en/aliyah-to-israel-by-dna-test/)), and Blaer Law ([Source](https://blaerlaw.com/en/judaism-israel-and-dna-or-how-to-obtain-israeli-citizenship-if-documents-are-not-in-order/)), focus on the use of DNA tests within legal frameworks, not their illegality.
