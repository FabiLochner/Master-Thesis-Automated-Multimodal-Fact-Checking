Useful result: From [Source](https://www.sochfactcheck.com/does-viral-image-show-us-flagged-ship-targeted-by-houthis-in-july-2024-gulf-of-aden/): 
Content: The search result from Soch Fact Check includes an image of a ship on fire with a Twitter post that says "Reports of a ship with a US flag targeted in the gulf of Aden" dated July 9, 2024. <image:7476>

The claim 'A US-flagged vessel has been attacked in the Guld of Aden in July 2024. A Spokesperson at Denmark's shipping company Maersk said: 'There was an attack targeted on one of the company's US-flagged vessels at the northernmost part of the Gulf of Aden.'' is false.
Justification: The claim is partially supported by the evidence. An image search revealed a Twitter post reporting an attack on a US-flagged ship in the Gulf of Aden on July 9, 2024, as shown in the search results (<image:7476>). However, the evidence does not include a statement from a Maersk spokesperson, making the claim false.

So, the overall veracity is: false
