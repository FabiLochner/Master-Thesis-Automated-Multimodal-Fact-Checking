## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing ammunition. The BBC News published articles on September 26, 2024, discussing Zelensky's meeting with US President Joe Biden and his visit to an ammunition factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania, where he signed ammunition. The Associated Press published an article on September 25, 2024, discussing House Speaker Mike Johnson's demand for Zelenskyy to remove Ukraine's ambassador to the U.S. due to Zelenskyy's visit to a Pennsylvania ammunition plant.

The articles do not mention Israeli bombs or Gaza.

### Evidence from `image_search`
The Guardian published an image of Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing a bomb (![image 7264](media/2025-08-29_21-20-1756502412-972178.jpg)). The BBC News website shows an image of Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing artillery shells (![image 7265](media/2025-08-29_21-20-1756502413-075257.jpg)). The Penn Capital-Star published an article about Volodymyr Zelenskyy's visit to an ammunition factory (![image 7267](media/2025-08-29_21-20-1756502413-342824.jpg)).


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the image shows Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing ammunition, specifically artillery shells, at an ammunition factory. The event occurred in September 2024. The evidence does not mention Israeli bombs or that the ammunition was intended for use against Palestinians in Gaza.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The image shows Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing ammunition, not Israeli bombs. The event took place in September 2024, not March 2025. There is no evidence to support the claim that the ammunition was intended for use against Palestinians in Gaza.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE
