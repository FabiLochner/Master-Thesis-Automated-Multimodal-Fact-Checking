Useful result: From [Source](https://www.savethechildren.net/stories/nowhere-safe-children-gaza):

The claim '<image:38> This image shows two children in Gaza in April 2025 found dead under the rubble of their home two months after an Israeli airstrike destroyed it.' is false.
Justification: The image in the claim is of mummified children from a Bolivian museum, as confirmed by a reverse image search ([Source](https://kashif.ps/en/index.php/2025/04/14/image-of-two-mummified-children-in-a-bolivian-museum-goes-viral-as-from-gaza/)). The image was posted on Flickr in 2006, thus contradicting the claim that it depicts children found in Gaza in 2025.

So, the overall veracity is: false
