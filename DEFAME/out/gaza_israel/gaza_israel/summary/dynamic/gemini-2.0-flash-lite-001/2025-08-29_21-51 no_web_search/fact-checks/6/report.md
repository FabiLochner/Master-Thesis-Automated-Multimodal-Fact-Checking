## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (![image 7](media/6.jpg)) of Benjamin Netanyahu in a hospital bed has been identified in multiple sources. One source, a Forbes article from November 8, 2023, debunks the image as fake, likely created using AI, and notes that Netanyahu was giving an interview on the same day the image went viral. The article can be found here: [Source](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattnovak/2023/11/08/viral-photo-of-benjamin-netanyahu-hospitalized-is-actually-fake/).

Other sources, such as SabaNet ([Source](https://www.saba.ye/en/news3416306.htm/)) and en.webangah.ir ([Source](https://en.webangah.ir/2024-12-30/news=240102/)), both published in December 2024, report on Netanyahu's prostate cancer diagnosis, surgery, and subsequent transfer to an underground ward.


### Evidence from `image_search`
Politico reports that Benjamin Netanyahu was discharged from the hospital ([https://www.politico.com/news/2023/07/16/israel-netanyahu-discharged-hospital-00106491](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/07/16/israel-netanyahu-discharged-hospital-00106491)). CNN reports that Benjamin Netanyahu was admitted to the hospital ([https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/15/middleeast/netanyahu-admitted-hospital-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/15/middleeast/netanyahu-admitted-hospital-intl)). The Hindu reports that Benjamin Netanyahu was rushed to the hospital ([https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/israels-prime-minister-netanyahu-rushed-to-hospital-his-office-says-he-is-in-good-condition/article67084595.ece](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/israels-prime-minister-netanyahu-rushed-to-hospital-his-office-says-he-is-in-good-condition/article67084595.ece)). ![image 7447](media/2025-08-29_21-53-1756504383-619472.jpg), ![image 7448](media/2025-08-29_21-53-1756504384-056112.jpg), ![image 7452](media/2025-08-29_21-53-1756504385-275886.jpg)


## Elaboration
The claim is false. The image has been debunked as fake by Forbes ([https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattnovak/2023/11/08/viral-photo-of-benjamin-netanyahu-hospitalized-is-actually-fake/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattnovak/2023/11/08/viral-photo-of-benjamin-netanyahu-hospitalized-is-actually-fake/)). While Netanyahu has been hospitalized, the provided image is not authentic.


## Final Judgement
The image of Benjamin Netanyahu in a hospital bed has been identified as fake by Forbes, which reported that the image was likely created using AI. While Netanyahu has been hospitalized on other occasions, the image in question is not authentic.

The claim is demonstrably false because the image has been debunked by a reliable source. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE
