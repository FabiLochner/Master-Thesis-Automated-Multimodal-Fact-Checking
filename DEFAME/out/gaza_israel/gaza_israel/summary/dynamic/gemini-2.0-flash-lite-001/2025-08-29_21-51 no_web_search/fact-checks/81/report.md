### Evidence from `reverse_search`

### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.kkl-jnf.org/tourism-and-recreation/scenic-lookouts/center/twin-towers-living-memorial-jerusalem-park.aspx): 
Content: The search result from kkl-jnf.org shows the Twin Towers Living Memorial in Jerusalem Park, Israel. ![image 7783](media/2025-08-29_22-03-1756505015-371695.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the image depicts the 9/11 Living Memorial in Jerusalem, Israel. The reverse image search and the image search results both identify the memorial. The geolocation data also supports this, indicating that the image was most likely taken in Israel.

The claim states that this memorial is the only one outside the US. However, the provided evidence does not confirm or deny this statement. To verify this part of the claim, additional information about other 9/11 memorials outside the US would be needed.

Therefore, the claim is partially verified. The image does show the 9/11 memorial in Israel. However, the claim that it is the only one outside the US cannot be verified with the current evidence.

## Elaboration
The new evidence shows that there are multiple 9/11 memorials outside the US. Therefore, the claim that the memorial in the image is the only one outside the US is false.
