## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image shows the USS Mount Whitney (LCC 20) and other ships participating in the Baltic Operations 2024 (BALTOPS 24) exercise in the Baltic Sea on June 8, 2024. The USS Mount Whitney arrived in Kiel, Germany on June 19, 2024, marking the end of its participation in BALTOPS 24. The exercise involved various NATO countries, including the United States. The image is from a U.S. government website. ![image 55](media/86.jpg)

### Evidence from `image_search`
Business Insider shows an image of a U.S. Navy warship (![image 7797](media/2025-08-29_22-04-1756505056-785436.jpg)). The World Socialist Web Site published an article on August 13, 2024, which includes an image of U.S. warships (![image 7798](media/2025-08-29_22-04-1756505057-818748.jpg)). The Los Angeles Times reports that the U.S. is shifting an assault ship to the Mediterranean to deter an escalation of the Israel-Hezbollah conflict (![image 7799](media/2025-08-29_22-04-1756505059-106521.jpg)).

## Elaboration
The image in the claim (![image 55](media/86.jpg)) shows ships participating in the BALTOPS 24 exercise in the Baltic Sea in June 2024, not en route to the Lebanon coast in August 2024. The evidence from the image search indicates that U.S. warships were in the region in August 2024, but the specific image in the claim is unrelated to the events described.

The claim is therefore false.


## Final Judgement
The image provided in the claim shows ships participating in the BALTOPS 24 exercise in the Baltic Sea in June 2024, not U.S. warships en route to the Lebanon coast in August 2024. While there is evidence of U.S. warships in the region during August 2024, the image is misrepresented.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image in the claim is from the Baltic Operations 2024 (BALTOPS 24) exercise in the Baltic Sea in June 2024, as confirmed by a reverse image search ([https://www.dvidshub.net/news/474750/uss-mount-whitney-lcc-20-arrives-kiel-germany-marking-its-final-stop-after-completing-baltops-24](https://www.dvidshub.net/news/474750/uss-mount-whitney-lcc-20-arrives-kiel-germany-marking-its-final-stop-after-completing-baltops-24)). The image does not depict U.S. warships en route to the Lebanon coast in August 2024.
