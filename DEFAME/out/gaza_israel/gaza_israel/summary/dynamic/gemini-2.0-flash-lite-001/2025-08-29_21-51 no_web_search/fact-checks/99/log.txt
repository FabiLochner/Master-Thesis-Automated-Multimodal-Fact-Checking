The claim '<image:65> This is an authentic image of an elderly Palestinian women being attacked by an Israeli army dog in June 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is likely false. While the image has been linked to an incident involving an Israeli police dog and an elderly Palestinian woman, as reported by sources like [Morocco World News](https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2024/06/18005/israeli-police-dog-attack-on-elderly-palestinian-woman-sparks-outrage/), geolocation analysis suggests the image was not taken in Israel or Palestine, indicating it is likely not authentic.

So, the overall veracity is: false
