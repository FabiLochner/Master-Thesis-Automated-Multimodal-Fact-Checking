### A Year of Genocide: Palestinian civilians killed by Israeli airstrikes on homes in Gaza

![A Year of Genocide: Palestinian civilians killed by Israeli airstrikes on homes in Gaza](/image/NewsThumbImg/Default/05441a75-58ba-4197-8d73-178721d63d22.jpg)

GAZA, October 7, 2024 (WAFA) - Three Palestinian citizens were killed and dozens were injured on Monday in an Israeli bombing that targeted citizens' homes in the Nuseirat and Bureij camps in the central Gaza Strip.

Local sources said that three citizens were killed and others were injured after Israeli warplanes bombed several homes in Block 1 in the Bureij camp in the central Gaza Strip.

! <image:557>

They added that the bombing targeted citizens' homes west of Nuseirat camp in the central Gaza Strip, which resulted in the injury of at least seven citizens, coinciding with the Israeli drones firing on several areas in the camp.

The Israeli warplanes bombed a house in the Saftawi area northwest of Gaza City, which resulted in the injury of a number of citizens.

The occupation forces continue the brutal aggression against the Gaza Strip, by land, sea and air, since October 7, 2023, which resulted in the killing of 41,870 citizens and the injury of 97,166 others, most of whom are children and women, in an incomplete toll, as thousands of missing persons are still under the rubble.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that the U.S. has been involved in bombing Yemen. However, the provided evidence does not confirm the specific details of the claim, such as the date (December 22, 2024) or the reason for the bombing (reprisal for an attack on Israel's capital).

The image search results show that bombings in Yemen have occurred, and the Guardian article mentions the US bombing of Yemen. However, the exact context of the image in the claim is not verified.

Therefore, the claim is not entirely verifiable based on the provided evidence. More information is needed to confirm the date, the specific events, and the context of the image.

_________________________



JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:5> This image shows the U.S. bombarding Yemen on December 22, 2024 in reprisal after Yemen launched an attack on Israel's capital."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:5>)
image_search("bombing in Yemen")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:5>

### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include articles and images related to bombings in Yemen. Stimson.org has an image of a bombing in Yemen (<image:7442>). The Guardian published an article about the US bombing of Yemen (<image:7443>). NBC News published an article about the war in Yemen, which includes an image of an explosion (<image:7444>).

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the U.S. has been involved in bombing Yemen. However, the provided evidence does not confirm the specific details of the claim, such as the date (December 22, 2024) or the reason for the bombing (reprisal for an attack on Israel's capital).

The image search results show that bombings in Yemen have occurred, and the Guardian article mentions the US bombing of Yemen. However, the exact context of the image in the claim is not verified.

Therefore, the claim is not entirely verifiable based on the provided evidence. More information is needed to confirm the date, the specific events, and the context of the image.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The geolocation of the image suggests it was most likely taken in Palestine or Israel. The image search results show that Israeli strikes occurred in Yemen in December 2024, as reported by CNN and The New York Times. This contradicts the claim that the U.S. was responsible for the bombing. The claim also states that the bombing was in reprisal for an attack on Israel's capital, which is not confirmed by the evidence.

Therefore, the claim is **false**.

_________________________



JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

The International Court of Justice issued an advisory opinion on July 19, 2024, regarding the legal consequences of Israel's policies and practices in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem.

In a shocking incident in the National Capital Region, a young man, Ashu, suffered severe burns when his toilet exploded. His father, Sunil Pradhan, reported that Ashu sustained 35% burns and was hospitalized. Authorities suspect methane gas buildup from clogged drains as the cause, though the spark's origin remains unclear.

A bizarre and frightening accident took place in the National Capital Region of the country, when a usual visit to the bathroom turned into a nightmare for a young man who suffered some serious injuries as his home’s toilet exploded!Ashu’s father, Sunil Pradhan, described the horrifying moment, “The blast left Ashu with severe burn injuries to his face and body. He was rushed to the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) in Greater Noida, where doctors confirmed he had suffered 35% burns,” said a TOI report. Importantly, he clarified that Ashu wasn’t using any mobile phone or electronic gadget at the time, ruling out some common theories like gadget explosions.While this might sound like something from a bizarre news column, this kind of accident could actually happen anywhere, especially in homes with aging or poorly maintained plumbing systems.

Poll

Do you believe that regular maintenance of plumbing systems can prevent accidents like toilet explosions?

Yes, absolutelyNo, it's not necessary

What really happened?  

------------------------

According to early assessments, the explosion was not triggered by electrical issues. The home’s air conditioning and all other appliances were functioning properly at the time. But the real reason behind this blast was the least expected but potentially dangerous cause, the methane gas buildup.The family suspects that methane may have accumulated inside the toilet bowl due to a clogged drain, and a spark might have ignited the gas, leading to the explosion, though the source of the spark is unclear.

Local resident Harinder Bhati shared his concerns, saying, “Pipes here are not just old, but they haven’t been cleaned in years. Choked pipes can lead to the accumulation of gas, which can explode under pressure.” This sentiment was echoed by experts, including a chemistry professor, who explained that methane can indeed collect in sewer lines and confined bathroom spaces, particularly where ventilation is poor or drains are blocked.Despite the alarming nature of the incident, AP Verma, a senior manager of the Greater Noida Authority, stated, “The system is clean and functioning normally. It appears that the explosion might have resulted from some internal problem within the house.” However, he did not clarify what those internal problems could be.

Why could this happen anywhere?  

----------------------------------

This incident is a wake-up call about how aging plumbing, poor ventilation, and neglected sewage maintenance can create dangerous conditions even in modern homes. While such explosions are rare, it is advised that homeowners regularly inspect and clean their plumbing systems, especially in older buildings, to prevent dangerous gas buildup.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu- X

**Washington:** President Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu are set to meet Tuesday as the Israeli prime minister faces competing pressure from his right-wing coalition to end a temporary truce against Hamas militants in Gaza and from war-weary Israelis who want the remaining hostages home and the 15-month conflict to end.

Trump is guarded about the long-term prospects for the truce, even as he takes credit for pressuring Hamas and Israel into the hostage and ceasefire agreement that went into effect the day before he returned to office last month.

“I have no guarantees that the peace is going to hold,” Trump told reporters on Monday.

[![MS Teachers](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20336%20280'%3E%3C/svg%3E)](//forms.gle/Ra71M9QCEdsnn5uP8)

The leaders’ talks are expected to touch on a long-sought Israel-Saudi Arabia normalisation deal and concerns about Iran’s nuclear programme, but hammering out the second phase of the hostage deal will be at the top of the agenda.

Netanyahu’s arrival in Washington for the first foreign leader visit of Trump’s second term comes as the prime minister’s popular support is lagging. Netanyahu is in the middle of weekslong testimony in an ongoing corruption trial that centres on allegations he exchanged favours with media moguls and wealthy associates. He has decried the accusations and said he is the victim of a “witch hunt”.

Being seen with Trump, who is popular in Israel, could help distract the public from the trial and boost Netanyahu’s standing.

It’s Netanyahu’s first travel outside Israel since the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants in November for him, his former defence minister and Hamas’ slain military chief, accusing them of crimes against humanity during the war in Gaza. The US does not recognise the ICC’s authority over its citizens or territory.

Netanyahu and Trump’s Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff on Monday began the daunting work of brokering the next phase of a ceasefire agreement.

Netanyahu said in statement that the meeting with Witkoff and US National Security Adviser Michael Waltz was “positive and friendly”.

[![Germanten Hospital](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20336%20280'%3E%3C/svg%3E)](//www.germantenhospitals.com/?ref=siasat.com)

The Israeli leader said he would send a delegation to Qatar to continue indirect talks with Hamas that are being mediated by the Gulf Arab country, the first confirmation that those negotiations would continue. Netanyahu also said he would convene his security Cabinet to discuss Israel’s demands for the next phase of the ceasefire when he returns to Israel at the end of the week.

Netanyahu is under intense pressure from hard-right members of his governing coalition to abandon the ceasefire and resume fighting in Gaza to eliminate Hamas. Bezalel Smotrich, one of Netanyahu’s key partners, vows to topple the government if the war isn’t relaunched, a step that could lead to early elections.

Hamas, which has reasserted control over Gaza since the ceasefire began last month, has said it will not release hostages in the second phase without an end to the war and Israeli forces’ full withdrawal. Netanyahu, meanwhile, maintains that Israel is committed to victory over Hamas and the return of all hostages captured in the Oct 7, 2023 attack that triggered the war.

Mira Resnick, a former deputy assistant secretary of state for Israeli and Palestinian affairs, said Trump may “have little patience for political woes of Netanyahu if it gets in the way of the broader goals of this administration.”

“The president started his term by saying that he wanted the ceasefire to be in place by Jan. 20. That’s what he got,” Resnick said. “He is invested in this because he was able to take credit for it.”

Einav Zangauker, whose son Matan is among the hostages, called on Trump to use American leverage to keep Netanyahu committed to the agreement.

Matan, 24, is among those who are expected to be included in the second phase of the deal, when all remaining living hostages — including men under the age of 50 and male soldiers — are to be exchanged for a yet-to-be-determined number of Palestinian prisoners. The second phase is also expected to include the full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza.

“I want President Trump to know there are certain extreme elements from within Israel who are trying to torpedo his vision,” said Zangauker, who travelled to Washington from Israel to join a planned Tuesday rally outside the White House. “We are representative of the vast, vast majority of Israel. The ultra-extremists are blackmailing the prime minister to do their bidding.”

Since returning to office, Trump has called for relocating Palestinians from Gaza to neighboring Egypt and Jordan, even as Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi and Jordanian King Abdullah II have rejected it. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, the Palestinian Authority and the Arab League have joined Egypt and Jordan in rejecting plans to move Palestinians out of their territories in Gaza and the occupied West Bank.

Yet Trump insists he can persuade Egypt and Jordan to come around to accept displaced Palestinians because of the significant aid that the US provides Cairo and Amman. Hard-line right-wing members of Netanyahu’s government have embraced the call to move displaced Palestinians out of Gaza.

Shibley Telhami, the Anwar Sadat Professor for Peace and Development at the University of Maryland, said the push by Trump to move Palestinians out of Gaza is helpful to Netanyahu. But he added that it undercuts Trump and Netanyahu’s desire to land a normalisation deal with Saudi Arabia.

The Saudis, the biggest Arab power in the Middle East, have said they would only agree to such a deal if the war ends and there is a credible pathway to a Palestinian state in Gaza and the West Bank.

“This push by Trump doesn’t square with the idea of a Palestinian state as we know it,” Telhami said. “It’s hard to see the Saudis going along with it.”

Netanyahu on Monday met with Trump’s pick to serve as ambassador to Israel, former Arkansas Gov Mike Huckabee, and evangelical leaders. Huckabee has long rejected a Palestinian state in territory previously seized by Israel.

The prime minister is also expected to press Trump to take decisive action on Iran. Tehran has faced a series of military setbacks, including Israeli forces significantly degrading Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah militants in Lebanon as well as an operation that decimated Iran’s air defences. The moment, Netanyahu believes, has created a window to decisively address Tehran’s nuclear programme.

“This is one of the most important and critical meetings between an American president and an Israeli prime minister,” said Eytan Gilboa, an expert on US-Israel relations at Bar-Ilan University near the Israeli city of Tel Aviv. “What’s at stake here is not just bilateral relations between Israel and the United States but the reshaping of the Middle East.”

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

Following a recent boxing match between Jake Paul and former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson, a widely shared photo surfaced showing Tyson posing with a Palestinian flag before the fight. This image garnered significant attention and commentary on social media. However, Fact Crescendo’s fact-checking team revealed that the photo circulating on Facebook was generated by artificial intelligence.

**Social Media Claim**

An image of American boxing legend Mike Tyson alongside the Palestinian flag has been widely shared on social media recently, suggesting he supports the Palestinian people.

Below is a screenshot of a Facebook post from November 16, 2024, with a caption in Khmer stating, “Mike Tyson poses with the Palestinian flag before a fight.”

 | [Archived Link](https://archive.vn/G2eZh)

The same picture was widely circulated on social media with English captions as well, attracting significant attention and reactions from users.

Similar claims have also been widely shared on other social media platforms, including [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/nj.iliass/p/DCZ8h_EN1KC/)

A similar photo was also posted on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4LHnur7Ao)
 on November 16, showing Mike Tyson holding a Palestinian flag before a fight.

**Fact Check**

Fact Crescendo verified these images using Google Reverse Image Search and AI verification tools. Then, we discovered the following facts.

By running an AI-generated image detector, we discovered that the photo was not authentic. It was created by artificial intelligence (AI) rather than being a real photograph of an actual event.

The findings revealed that the image shown in the photo was entirely generated by AI technology, rather than being captured in reality.

 | [Archived Link](https://archive.vn/6sQc8)

Fact Crescendo also searched Getty Images, a reputable source for authentic photos, and found several images of Mike Tyson before and during the fight. None of these photos showed Tyson holding a Palestinian flag.

This further disproves the claim, as it suggests that no legitimate images from the event feature Tyson with the flag. This reinforces the fact that the original photo shared on social media was not genuine.

The Fact Crescendo team, a group dedicated to verifying and fact-checking claims, also watched the livestream of the highly anticipated fight between Jake Paul, a well-known social media personality turned boxer, and former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson. This event, which took place on November 16, was reportedly streamed on Netflix, a popular streaming platform known for airing documentaries and films, though typically not live sports events. 

After carefully reviewing the stream, the team observed no instance where Mike Tyson, the legendary boxer, was seen wearing a Palestine flag, contrary to certain claims that circulated online. The Fact Crescendo team has found no evidence or visual confirmation that Tyson posing that at all.

Carlos María de Cerón y Castro. Kiev, Ukraine.

Five years ago I was blessed with my first field assignment with the United Nations. Since then I have devoted myself to the humanitarian efforts that exemplifies the best aspects of the UN.

Over the last months I have had the opportunity to be part of numerous field visits to Ukraine. It was during those memorable visits that I fell in love with the country and its people. It suddenly became a burning desire to be assigned to Ukraine on a more permanent basis.

Today, the OSCE has deemed me professionally and personally capable of undertaking a new assignment in the Ukraine.

I look forward to this new challenge and I thank the Ukrainian people for welcoming me to their wonderful country.

I hope to see you all soon and welcome you to visit me in the Ukraine!

A couple of weeks ago, I wrote in "[The Natural Consequences Of](https://www.63rdfloor.com/post/the-natural-consequences-of-hamas-attack)
 Hamas' [Attack](https://www.63rdfloor.com/post/the-natural-consequences-of-hamas-attack)
" that the despicable terrorist attack of Hamas preordained the Israeli bombing and incursion into Gaza. Even with time to think and to hear a contrary view from someone whose motives and heart are pure, I stand by every word I wrote. The blood of every Gazan who has died is on Hamas' hands.

  

But one thing she brought to my attention demanded serious consideration. What should Israel do next?

  

Whatever the answer, the overriding imperative should be a just peace with full security guarantees. Without peace, it will be next to impossible for Israel to continue as a democratic Jewish homeland. If the goal, out of an understandable desire for vengeance, is only to destroy Hamas, then Israel should heed the warning from the great Chinese philosopher Confucious - “Those who seek revenge must dig two graves."

  

![Gravestone with outline of Israel](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/5fb357_c5e3da143e32495d83547b520e5f5cf0~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_103,h_116,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto/5fb357_c5e3da143e32495d83547b520e5f5cf0~mv2.jpg)

  

Before answering, I need to lay out my ground rules. My paramount interest is what is good for Israel and for Jews. How it affects Hamas, Hezbollah, and their fellow travelers is of no concern to me. Their fate is irrelevant. Nor are the historic grievances of Palestinians my concern. Yes, they have been mistreated by everyone, including Israel, and have been used as political footballs by Arab leaders to distract their citizens from rightful grievances. But Jews have lived in the Land of Israel for millennia, and there has never been a Palestinian State. Additionally, the beliefs or positions of other Arab countries hold no moral authority; they have rejected a two-state solution too often.

![Map of UN 1948 Partition Plan Rejected By Arab Countries](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/5fb357_42d551fd1dde4c369b61ee112a0cdde2~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_94,h_164,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto/5fb357_42d551fd1dde4c369b61ee112a0cdde2~mv2.jpg)

Palestine in yellow)

  

But most of all, I give no credence to the opinions of those who are quick to condemn Israel with such vitriol and to ignore the evil of others. They were silent when the Syrian Government of Bashar al-Assad attacked its own citizens with chemical weapons. [Estimates of the death toll ranged from 281 people to 1,729.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghouta_chemical_attack)
 They were silent when a Saudi Arabia-led coalition invaded Yemen. That war has killed an estimated 377,000 people, has contributed to the [famine in Yemen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine_in_Yemen)
, which has threatened over 17 million people, and caused an [outbreak of cholera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016%E2%80%9317_Yemen_cholera_outbreak)
 that has infected hundreds of thousands. They were silent when, in 1991, 287,000 Palestinians were forced by the [Kuwaiti security forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuwait_Military_Forces)
 to leave Kuwait.

  

Apparently, the deaths of citizens of Syria or Yemen do not matter. Nor do the lives of Palestinians seem to matter if Israel is not involved. Or maybe they are only incensed when it is Jews doing the killing or expelling?  

There are only two intertwined interests that need to be considered - the State of Israel and, by necessity, the Palestinians. There is an old saying that “If my Grandmother had wheels, she’d be a bicycle.” You deal with the world as it is, not as you hope it to be. Put another way, Israel cannot act as if the Palestinians do not exist.

  

Israel is situated in a dangerous neighborhood, and that is not going to change soon. The historic grievances against Israel, whether justified or not, are not going to disappear. There is no chance that without some monumental change, anyone will ever just let ‘bygones be bygones'. Even if Israel kills every member of Hamas, without change, there will be another terrorist organization to take its place.  

What is next after the attack on Hamas needs to be at the forefront.

  

When considering alternatives, I am drawn to thoughts attributed to four individuals. The first is Confucious ' warning to those who seek vengeance.

  

The second is the assassinated Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. Rabin was no peacenik. When faced with the Intifada in 1987, he instructed Israeli soldiers to break Palestinian arms and legs. Yet, when asked why he was entering into an agreement with the PLO and Yasser Arafat, he responded,

> “You don't make peace with friends. You make it with very unsavory enemies.”

  

The third is Ben Franklin, who observed that “Out of Adversity Comes Opportunity.”

  

The last, and the most important, is the Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir. Upon meeting Egyptian President Anwar Sadat when he arrived in Israel, she said,

> “I can forgive you for killing my boys, but I can never forgive you for making our boys kill yours.”

Prime Minister Meir recognized that for each death that a soldier causes, no matter how subjectively justified, a little of the soldier's soul also dies with the heart commensurately hardening. Being a warm, caring, and compassionate person is not conducive to being able to engage in even a fully justified war. These characteristics are antithetical to war’s goal – kill the enemy.

![ree](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/5fb357_9087b13c69414aeebde564ed35e6f087~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_96,h_98,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto/5fb357_9087b13c69414aeebde564ed35e6f087~mv2.jpg)

  

The same is true for nations. Although not made of skin and bone, nations also have souls. This idea goes back to Plato, who, in The Republic, opined that a state is infused with a soul that resembles that of its citizens. How just a state acts, how it treats outsiders, who it treats as important, what values it cherishes, and what it considers evil are all considerations defining the soul of a nation. For every country, there is hopefully a constant fight for what the historian [Jon Meacham](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38385947-the-soul-of-america)
 calls the battle for our better angels.

  

That battle is difficult enough when the nation is at peace and not faced with war or another existential crisis. Nations, like people, have survival instincts. Especially nations that have been at war since their founding are surrounded by countries who have pledged to push them back into the sea and were founded partially as a refuge for survivors of Hitler’s Final Solution. It becomes too easy for a national response to a brutal and unjustified attack to focus on the short-term imperative of rescue or prevention without taking into account long-term implications. When it is believed that your very survival is threatened, your vision becomes myopic and focused on the here and now.

  

For Israel, the short-term goal must be determined with the long-term in mind. I do not doubt that Israel wants to live peacefully with its neighbors. The terms of that peace may be debatable, but those who think otherwise ignore the treaties Israel has signed and lived up to with past perennial enemies, Egypt and Jordan. Whether the desire comes from altruism or cold calculations is irrelevant.

  

All but the most hardened rightists understand that the Palestinians are not going anywhere. Indeed, other Arab nations will not welcome them. The West Bank was under the control of Jordan for almost 20 years, yet no Palestinian state was formed. Egypt exercised identical control of Gaza. Palestinians have nowhere to go. They are Israel's problem.

  

Without a viable peace between Israel and Palestinians, Israelis will live on a continual war footing with all that this means for their economy and nation's psyche. Israel is not looking to occupy Gaza with a continuous military occupation. This is why they unilaterally left Gaza in 2005, along with the forced dismantling and evacuation of 21 Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip. Eight thousand Jewish settlers from the 21 settlements in the Gaza Strip were forcibly relocated.

  

![Israeli Soldiers, in 2005, forcibly removed settlers from Gaza](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/5fb357_d44ce4ead22d46569f5d8c5286a722c7~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_147,h_30,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto/5fb357_d44ce4ead22d46569f5d8c5286a722c7~mv2.jpg)

Israeli soldiers, in 2005, forcibly removed settlers from Gaza.

  

Their rationale for leaving was calculated and not based on what was good for Gazans. A primary reason was an understanding of demographic realities and the costs of a continued occupation. Then Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, in an address on the day that Israel ceded control of Gaza, stated,

> "It is no secret that, like many others, I had believed and hoped we could forever hold onto \[the settlements of\] Netzarim and Kfar Darom. But the changing reality in the country, in the region, and the world required of me to reassess and change of positions. We cannot hold on to Gaza forever. Over 1 million Palestinians live there, and they double their numbers with every generation.”

  

At the same time, then Vice Prime Minister Shimon Peres confirmed that

> “We are disengaging from Gaza because of demography.”

  

Israel's dilemma was that it could not occupy Gaza without an occupation that would require brutality that the nation was not willing to undertake. Nor was Israel willing to change its character as a Jewish State by making a million predominantly Muslim Arab citizens. The choice was between maintaining Israel as a democracy or a Jewish State. Faced with equally unacceptable alternatives, even a hawk, like Prime Minister Sharon knew there had to be a third way. Israel just had to leave.

  

Almost twenty years later, Israel is on the verge of forgetting why it left Gaza. Hamas has given no indication that it is going down easily, and Israel has at least publicly committed itself to stay in Gaza for as long as it takes to destroy Hamas. Even if it takes years. In those years, Israel will correctly be viewed by Gazans as an occupying force. Israel will be responsible for the feeding, housing, and medical care of every Gazan. Israel will be held accountable for all that is wrong, regardless of genuine fault. If anyone doubts who will be blamed, remember how quickly most of the world wrongly accused Israel of the explosion at Gaza City’s Ahli Arab Hospital.

  

The author, Thomas Friedman, published an [interesting opinion piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/19/opinion/biden-speech-israel-gaza.html)
 in which he pleaded with the Israeli Government to pair its incursion into Gaza with an honest and public diplomatic pursuit of a two-state solution. Friedman feared that the situation would quickly spin out of everyone’s control, endangering Israel's relations with Egypt, Jordan, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates, dooming treaties with other Arab nations, and, at the same time, irreparably injuring American interests.

  

I do not always agree with Friedman, but this time he is right. Which brings me to Ben Franklin and Confucius as representatives of the possible polar outcomes. Franklin's statement that “out of adversity comes opportunity” is the more optimistic. Any optimism flows from the realization that the Arab / Muslim world is not monolithic, and there was a real possibility before the Hamas attack that Israel would normalize relations with Saudi Arabia and others. Hamas and the Palestinian Authority on the West Bank are reluctant allies if they are allies at all. Hamas is primarily a Sunni Muslim organization. Iran has funded and armed Hamas despite their religious differences to destabilize the region.

  

The lack of a unified Arab response was highlighted when, on November 11th, a joint summit of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and the Arab League unsurprisingly condemned Israel but was unable to agree on any sanctions. [The objections of four major countries prevented the imposition of any concrete measures to back the condemnation.](https://www.newarab.com/news/disagreements-led-joint-arab-oic-gaza-summit-riyadh)
  

Hezbollah, which controls Israel’s northern border, is Shiite Muslim and backed by Shiite Iran. In a recent address, the leader of Hezbollah spewed the usual rhetoric that one would expect but stayed clear of any commitment to any meaningful widening of the conflict. However, Hezbollah has fired dozens of rockets at some Israeli positions in a disputed area near the border. There have also been limited infiltrations of Hezbollah forces reported. Thankfully, there have only been minimal causalities on both sides.

  

What can bring these disparate interests into a firm alliance and widen/worsen the conflict in other parts of Israel is the inability of Israel to envision an end game other than revenge or punishment for the Hamas terrorist attack.

  

The situation has not been made any better by reciprocal escalation on the Israeli side. Militant Israelis on the West Bank have used the Hamas attack as justification for attacks of their own. [According to the United Nations](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/30/world/middleeast/west-bank-settlers-palestinians-violence.html)
, since October 7th, attacks on Palestinians have left 115 dead, more than 2,000 injured, and nearly 1,000 others removed from their homes. Israeli hardliners will also use the Hamas attack to bury even the slight chance for a two-state solution.

  

When Israel pulls its troops out of Gaza, it will not matter that they have killed every member of Hamas if the conditions that helped spawn Hamas are still present or have even worsened. An insightful [article by Anthony Cordesman](https://www.csis.org/analysis/war-gaza-and-death-two-state-solution)
 of the Center for Strategic & International Studies discussed the potential difficulties that Gaza faces. Cordesman observed that

> “\[t\]he present levels of poverty and unemployment in Gaza have made popular support of Hamas and violence all too serious. Israel's future wartime and postwar security efforts will almost certainly make this situation far worse.”

If the same poverty and violence that preceded Hamas outlives their destruction, all that Israel will have gained is a name change for their enemy.

  

The destruction of Hamas needs to be paired with a political solution and meaningful international aid conditioned on Palestinian non-violence; guaranteeing Israel’s security and oversight to ensure honest and effective use of the aid will be necessities. This requires the wealthy Gulf states to seriously step forward, write large checks, and take responsibility for how the funds are used. The United States needs to play a large role, but without significant and continued support from Arab countries, it will not be seen as an honest broker by Palestinians.

  

Israel will need to stop, and even pull back, from new settlements in disputed land. They must also reaffirm their commitment to a two-state solution. Arab countries and Palestinian organizations must unconditionally affirm Israel’s right to exist. The use of slogans such as "From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free" must end, along with antisemitic acts and statements. Just as Israelis must accept that the majority of Gazans do not share their views of Hamas, Palestinians must acknowledge that just because their words can be spun not to have antisemitic overtones does not make it so.

  

All this may be just a pipe dream of an uniformed and naive westerner who the Palestinians would dismiss as just another Zionist and by the Israelis as a Jew that does not understand. I am a Zionist and a firm supporter of Israel. The Israel I love is a homeland for the Jewish people and a democracy. And I loathe the Netanyahu government's attempts to eviscerate democratic checks and balances. I take pride that Israel is the only true democracy in the Middle East and that Arabs of various religious beliefs make up 20% of the Israeli population. I am proud that Arab citizens have equal civil rights, and there are currently 10 Arab members of the Knesset.

  

Sharon, Peres, and Rabin were correct that Israel needs peace and that "You don't make peace with friends. You make it with very unsavory enemies." The logic behind the 2005 decision for Israel to leave Gaza has more resonance today. Sharon, whom Palestinians blame for starting the Intifada when, as the leader of the Likud, he and his supports "[stormed](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/9/28/palestinian-intifada-20-years-later-israeli-occupation-continues)
" [the Temple Mount](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/9/28/palestinian-intifada-20-years-later-israeli-occupation-continues)
 and who was vilified for allowing the massacre at the [Sabra and Shatila massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabra_and_Shatila_massacre)
 to occur, understood that math was not on Israel's side. When he decided to leave Gaza, he publicly recognized the impossibility of a continued occupation of an area with one million Muslims. He also lamented that Israel could not wait to act because '\[o\]ver 1 million Palestinians live there, and they double their numbers with every generation." By 2020, the Gaza population exceeded 2 million.

  

![Population growth in Gaza](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/5fb357_c2d43589d6214d2f9a1bbc635138cbf5~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_147,h_99,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto/5fb357_c2d43589d6214d2f9a1bbc635138cbf5~mv2.jpg)

Population growth in Gaza

Franklin's parable can become a reality with Hamas gone or critically weakened. Opportunity will exist. But so many other times, it has existed and been squandered. One need only remember the euphoria and promises made when Rabin and Arafat signed their agreement at the White House. If the present opportunity is squandered, Israel will have gained nothing but revenge for the horrendous acts of Hamas. Maybe for a few years, things will be peaceful. But, in the long run, it will only be a temporary respite.

  

The Confucian prophesy will become too real if the revenge cycle spins out of control. What most Israeli proponents ignore is that in Gaza, Hamas is not considered an outlaw terrorist organization. It came to power and displaced the Palestinian Authority not through violence but through the ballot box. Sharon, in 2005, recognized that Gazans

> "live in incredibly cramped refugee camps, in poverty and squalor, in hotbeds of ever-increasing hatred, with no hope whatsoever on the horizon."

The Palestinian Authority did almost nothing to improve their living conditions.

  

It was not Hamas' desire to destroy Israel that led to their electoral victory but the rejection of the corruption and ineptitude of the Palestinian Authority. Conditions in Gaza did not become bright once Hamas came to power. But, the Israeli economic and security restrictions gave Hamas a built-in excuse that Gazans are very willing to accept.

  

The current Israeli incursion, while justified, only makes things worse for Gazans. Smart bombs are not yet smart enough to only blow up the homes of those who support Hamas. When a power plant is destroyed, it affects all who the plant supplied power without regard to their political positions. In the same manner that the barbarity of the Hamas murder of Israelis galvanized Israel and produced an immediate and overwhelming response, the response of the Gazans to what they see as an unjustified killing of their friends and loved ones will not be any less intense.

  

A major difference is that Gazans lack the military capabilities of Israel. But what they do have is the terrorism of organizations like El-Fatah, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, Abu-Nidal, and Black September. What these organizations have in common is that Israel destroyed them. Yet their demise did not end terrorist attacks on Israelis.

  

Palestinian terrorist organizations resemble the immortal phoenix, and no matter what Israel does, they cyclically regenerate or are otherwise born again. The only thing that will stop the cycle is to remove the birds' food source. In this case, it is the millions of Palestinians who believe, whether justified or not, that an unjust occupier controls their lives and those of their children. Sharon recognized that Gazans live "in hotbeds of ever-increasing hatred, with no hope whatsoever on the horizon." As long as these conditions do not change, nothing else will.

  

The hope that things will change and eventually get better is critical for any meaningful chance for peace. For Jews and Israel, the lessons of surviving the Final Solution is not only "Never Again." It is also that a key to survival in the death camps was hope. Nobel Laureate Ellie Weisel, a survivor of Auschwitz, found hope to be an essential ingredient.

> "Just as man cannot live without dreams, he cannot live without hope. If dreams reflect the past, hope summons the future."

Nations also require hope to move forward and institute significant change. That must be a belief that change will create something better than what is in the present. Otherwise, why take the risks that change will bring? The status quo may be untenable, but at least it is a situation you are aware of.

Both sides have lived through periods of hope that ended with disappointment. Perhaps the greatest danger is that the October 7th terror attack and the Israeli reaction will be the last nail in hope's coffin. If that is so, then the second grave needs to be dug.

A massive fire that broke out at an oil refinery near Iran’s capital and sent a huge plume of black smoke into the sky over Tehran has been extinguished after more than 20 hours, a news agency reports.

The semi-official ISNA agency quotes the country’s deputy oil minister, Alireza Sadeghabadi as saying the blaze was first fully contained and then finally put out.

“The courageous actions by firefighters … led to the complete extinguishing of the fire and prevented the flames from spreading to other nearby tanks,” says Sadeghabadi, thanking the fire department.

The fire erupted at the state-owned Tondgooyan Petrochemical Co. to the south of Tehran last night. The Oil Ministry’s SHANA news agency says it was caused by a leak in two waste tanks at the facility. Authorities initially suggested the flames affected a liquified petroleum gas pipeline at the refinery.

Jalal Maleki, spokesman for the Tehran Fire Department, tells state TV that 10 fire department stations, including 60 heavy operating vehicles and more than 180 firefighters, took part in the operation to battle the blaze.

A massive fire broke out Wednesday night at the oil refinery serving Iran’s capital, sending thick plumes of black smoke over Tehran. It wasn’t immediately clear if there were injuries.

The fire struck the state-owned Tondgooyan Petrochemical Co. to the south of Tehran, said Mansour Darajati, the director-general of the capital’s crisis management team.

Firefighters believe it struck a pipeline for liquefied petroleum gas at the facility, Darajati told Iranian state television. He did not elaborate.

Associated Press journalists in central Tehran, some 20 kilometers (12.5 miles) away, could see the black smoke rise in the distance. Another AP journalist saw flames shooting into the sky from the site.

Mojtaba Khaledi, the spokesman for Iran’s emergency department, told the semiofficial ISNA news agency that 10 ambulances and other equipment had been deployed at the scene of the fire. Hospitals in the area are on standby as well, he said.

It wasn’t immediately clear what started the blaze. Temperatures in Tehran reached nearly 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) on Wednesday. Hot summer weather in Iran has caused fires in the past.

The [blaze came the same day a fire](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-irans-largest-warship-catches-fire-sinks-in-gulf-of-oman-2/)
 struck the largest warship in the Iranian navy, which later sank in the Gulf of Oman.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence does not provide any information about the image's origin or the event it depicts. The reverse image search did not yield any results. The image search results show similar images of explosions and fires, but none of them match the original image.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available evidence. More information is needed to determine the context of the image.

_________________________



JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include an image of a nuclear explosion over a city at night from [Shutterstock](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/nuclear-explosion-city-night-739253215) <image:7537>, an article from the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/09/us/west-virginia-explosion.html) about an explosion at a chemical plant in West Virginia <image:7538>, and an image of a city engulfed in flames at night from [Stockcake](https://stockcake.com/i/city-engulfed-flames_1034836_127136) <image:7539>.


## Elaboration
The evidence does not provide any information about the image's origin or the event it depicts. The reverse image search did not yield any results. The image search results show similar images of explosions and fires, but none of them match the original image.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available evidence. More information is needed to determine the context of the image.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The provided evidence does not confirm the claim that the image depicts Israel bombing Tehran on October 26, 2024. The reverse image search did not yield any results, and the image search results show similar images of explosions and fires, but none of them match the original image.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

The search results include an image of a nuclear explosion over a city at night from [Shutterstock](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/nuclear-explosion-city-night-739253215) <image:7537>, an article from the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/09/us/west-virginia-explosion.html) about an explosion at a chemical plant in West Virginia <image:7538>, and an image of a city engulfed in flames at night from [Stockcake](https://stockcake.com/i/city-engulfed-flames_1034836_127136) <image:7539>.


## Elaboration
The evidence does not provide any information about the image's origin or the event it depicts. The reverse image search did not yield any results. The image search results show similar images of explosions and fires, but none of them match the original image.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available evidence. More information is needed to determine the context of the image.


## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:23>)
image_search("explosion in Tehran October 26, 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.44, 'Palestine': 0.44, 'Malta': 0.03, 'Jordan': 0.02, 'Tunisia': 0.01, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0}

### Evidence from `image_search`
The Times of Israel reports on explosions near Tehran (<image:7547>). Al Jazeera published a live blog on October 26, 2024, about Israel attacks on targets across Iran (<image:7549>). aNews.com.tr reports explosions in Tehran and nearby Karaj on October 26, 2024 (<image:7550>).

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that explosions occurred in Tehran on October 26, 2024, and that Israel was involved in attacks across Iran on the same date. The geolocation data indicates that the image was most likely taken in Israel or Palestine.

Based on the evidence, the claim is likely true.


## Final Judgement
The image search and geolocation data indicate that explosions occurred in Tehran on October 26, 2024, and that Israel was involved in attacks across Iran on the same date. The geolocation data suggests the image was most likely taken in Israel or Palestine.

Based on the evidence, the claim is likely true. `true`

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence reveals a Bob Geldof tour in New Zealand in March 2025, but it does not mention any tour with U2. The Getty Images search result shows Bob Geldof and Bono on stage together, but this does not confirm a joint tour in November 2024.

The claim cannot be verified because there is no evidence of a U2 and Bob Geldof tour in November 2024. The evidence only shows a solo tour by Bob Geldof and a picture of him with Bono.

The claim also mentions that the tour was to aid the Israeli army, which is not supported by any of the evidence.

American airline JetBlue on Sunday announced it is changing its [onboard maps](https://www.ynetnews.com/travel/article/skawilphc)
 on all carriers, to comply with U.S. guidelines for the Middle East, after Israel was labeled there as "Palestinian Territories."

In a message to Ynet, the company said its mission and values are that customers feel welcome and safe onboard. "We’re sorry for the concern this has caused. We can assure you that no one on the JetBlue team was involved with drawing or labeling the map of the region and we were not previously aware of the issue."

JetBlue map of the Middle East marks Israel as Palestinian Territories

After the public outrage expressed over the maps displayed on board JetBlue flights, the company said that the map app was provided to the airline by a third-party company, which they license from a specialty technology company.

"After a careful review, we have decided to switch to a new map vendor. While our content provider works on making this transition, we have also asked the current vendor to adjust our onboard map so that it aligns with the U.S. government’s map guidance for the region. We are making these changes as quickly as the technology allows."

The removal of Israel from the map angered a Jewish passenger who called out the airline but that was not the first time JetBlue was called out for possible anti-Israel bias. [In April](https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ry844wwz0)
, a Jewish passenger was ousted from a flight after complaining about a flight attendant wearing a "Free Palestine" pin on his uniform.

JetBlue apologized to the passenger and announced that it would change its policy.

"We hope with these actions we can welcome him back onto a JetBlue flight in the future," the company said, at the time.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The new evidence indicates that DNA tests are discussed in the context of Israeli law and procedures, specifically regarding Aliyah (immigration) and establishing Jewish identity. The Israel Democracy Institute ([Source](https://en.idi.org.il/articles/26956)), the Law Office in Israel ([Source](https://lawoffice.org.il/en/aliyah-to-israel-by-dna-test/)), and Blaer Law ([Source](https://blaerlaw.com/en/judaism-israel-and-dna-or-how-to-obtain-israeli-citizenship-if-documents-are-not-in-order/)) all mention DNA tests.

However, none of the provided sources explicitly state that it is illegal to conduct a DNA test in Israel. They focus on the use of DNA tests within legal frameworks, such as immigration and religious identity.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified. The evidence suggests that DNA tests are used and regulated in Israel, but not that they are illegal.

The fact-check reveals that DNA tests are discussed in the context of Israeli law, particularly concerning immigration and establishing Jewish identity. However, the provided sources do not explicitly state that it is illegal to conduct a DNA test in Israel.

The claim is not supported by the evidence. The evidence suggests that DNA tests are used and regulated in Israel, but not that they are illegal. `false`

# Instructions
You are provided with the record of a fact-check. It contains the Claim to be verified and a documentation of all the fact-checking work along the gathered evidence. Your task is to **summarize the fact-check**. That is, you provide a concise, one-paragraph justification for the final VERDICT based on the knowledge from the Record. Note:
* Be truthful, brief, do not add any additional information besides the information given in the Record. 
* Link key sources in your summary. Use Markdown notation for that. You may link them in-line.
* Don't state the Claim again. Rather focus on the key insights of the fact-check.
* Simply print just the summary.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "It is illegal to do a DNA test in Israel."

## Actions
```
image_search("DNA test Israel legality")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/rabbinate-dna-tests-seek-jewishness-in-the-blood-become-a-bone-of-contention/): 
Content: The Times of Israel discusses the use of DNA tests in Israel. <image:7597>


## Elaboration
The evidence from The Times of Israel ([Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/rabbinate-dna-tests-seek-jewishness-in-the-blood-become-a-bone-of-contention/)) discusses the use of DNA tests in Israel. However, the article does not mention whether it is illegal to do a DNA test in Israel.

Therefore, I cannot verify the claim. More information is needed to determine the legality of DNA tests in Israel.


## Actions
```
image_search("Israel DNA testing regulations")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include a discussion about DNA tests in Israel from the Israel Democracy Institute ([Source](https://en.idi.org.il/articles/26956)) <image:7603>. The Law Office in Israel discusses Aliyah to Israel by DNA test ([Source](https://lawoffice.org.il/en/aliyah-to-israel-by-dna-test/)) <image:7604>. Another source from Blaer Law ([Source](https://blaerlaw.com/en/judaism-israel-and-dna-or-how-to-obtain-israeli-citizenship-if-documents-are-not-in-order/)) is also included.


## Elaboration
The new evidence indicates that DNA tests are discussed in the context of Israeli law and procedures, specifically regarding Aliyah (immigration) and establishing Jewish identity. The Israel Democracy Institute ([Source](https://en.idi.org.il/articles/26956)), the Law Office in Israel ([Source](https://lawoffice.org.il/en/aliyah-to-israel-by-dna-test/)), and Blaer Law ([Source](https://blaerlaw.com/en/judaism-israel-and-dna-or-how-to-obtain-israeli-citizenship-if-documents-are-not-in-order/)) all mention DNA tests.

However, none of the provided sources explicitly state that it is illegal to conduct a DNA test in Israel. They focus on the use of DNA tests within legal frameworks, such as immigration and religious identity.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified. The evidence suggests that DNA tests are used and regulated in Israel, but not that they are illegal.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that DNA tests are discussed in the context of Israeli law, particularly concerning immigration and establishing Jewish identity. However, the provided sources do not explicitly state that it is illegal to conduct a DNA test in Israel.

The claim is not supported by the evidence. The evidence suggests that DNA tests are used and regulated in Israel, but not that they are illegal. `false`


## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim that it is illegal to do a DNA test in Israel is not supported by the evidence. While DNA tests are discussed in the context of Israeli law, particularly regarding immigration and establishing Jewish identity, none of the provided sources explicitly state that it is illegal to conduct a DNA test in Israel. The sources, including those from the Israel Democracy Institute ([Source](https://en.idi.org.il/articles/26956)), the Law Office in Israel ([Source](https://lawoffice.org.il/en/aliyah-to-israel-by-dna-test/)), and Blaer Law ([Source](https://blaerlaw.com/en/judaism-israel-and-dna-or-how-to-obtain-israeli-citizenship-if-documents-are-not-in-order/)), focus on the use of DNA tests within legal frameworks, not their illegality.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

Baldwin didn't speak often of Israel, but he still managed to say plenty." <image:7620> Another source, [Source](https://interminablerambling.medium.com/james-baldwin-jim-crow-and-the-holocaust-19480de4f380), contains an image of James Baldwin with a quote: "The crisis taking place in the world, and in the minds and hearts of black men everywhere, is not produced by the star of David, but by the old, rugged Roman cross on which Christendom's most celebrated Jew was murdered." <image:7622>


## Elaboration
The search results confirm that James Baldwin did speak about Israel. However, the provided evidence does not contain the quote in the Claim. Therefore, the veracity of the Claim cannot be determined.

More information is needed to verify the Claim.


## Actions

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that the U.S. government organized chartered flights to evacuate U.S. citizens from Israel in October 2023. However, the claim states that the U.S. government has been flying Israeli citizens out of Israel. The evidence does not support this. The claim also mentions the U.S. offering loans to Americans for flights out of Lebanon in October 2024. The evidence does not mention this.

The provided evidence does not contain enough information to verify the claim. Specifically, it lacks information about the U.S. government's actions regarding Israeli citizens and loan offers for flights from Lebanon.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that there were Israeli airstrikes in the Shejaeya neighborhood of Gaza City in April 2025. However, the evidence does not mention the baby Sham Imad Muhareb or whether she lost her arm in an airstrike.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified due to a lack of information about the baby.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:32> This image shows Palestinian baby Sham Imad Muhareb which did not lose her arm in an Israeli airstrike on the Shejaeya neighborhood, east of Gaza City, in April 2025."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:32>)
image_search("Palestinian baby Sham Imad Muhareb")
```

## Evidence
No new evidence found.

## Elaboration
The provided evidence does not contain any information to verify the claim. The reverse image search and the image search for the baby's name did not yield any results. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.


## Actions
```
image_search("Israeli airstrike Shejaeya neighborhood Gaza City April 2025")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
Reuters published an article on April 4, 2025, about Israeli troops expanding a security zone in northern Gaza, including a photograph of the Shejaeya neighborhood in Gaza City (<image:7674>). The Guardian reported on an Israeli bombing of a shelter in Gaza City in April 2025, with a photograph of the aftermath (<image:7675>). The BBC News website also contains an image of the Shejaeya neighborhood in Gaza City after an airstrike (<image:7676>).

The articles can be found at the following URLs: [Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-troops-expand-security-zone-northern-gaza-2025-04-04/), [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/03/at-least-27-killed-in-israeli-bombing-of-shelter-in-gaza-city-rescuers-say), and [Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy5rrnzw0kwo).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that there were Israeli airstrikes in the Shejaeya neighborhood of Gaza City in April 2025. However, the evidence does not mention the baby Sham Imad Muhareb or whether she lost her arm in an airstrike.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified due to a lack of information about the baby.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

The image search results confirm the existence of images of women in Gaza, but they do not provide any information about the tank or the clothes-drying activity. The initial reverse image search provided information about the location of the image, but not the date or the type of tank. Therefore, there is not enough information to verify the claim.

Cease-fire in Lebanon and Gaza\
------------------------------](/portfolio/927-hamas-israel-war)

After the Israeli strike of Wednesday night on a small building in Nabatieh, residents woke up in disbelief at what happened, according to testimonies given to L'Orient Today's correspondent in the area.

The Israeli air force targeted the western part of the city, amid the daily and escalating exchanges of fire between Hezbollah and the Israeli army along the Lebanese-Israeli border.

At least two missiles were fired at the two- or three-story building, according to security sources, residents, and rescuers whose testimonies were collected by our correspondent in the region.

On Thursday morning, Hussein Faqih, Head of the Civil Defence Centre in the Nabatieh Regional Centre, told L'Orient Today that the rescue operations in the destroyed building were concluded and that nine people suffered from injuries he qualified as "medium to light."

Others suffered from smoke inhalation caused by the explosions and loss of consciousness, according to Faqih.

The Civil Defense was deployed on-site, along with the Red Cross, al-Rissala scouts (affiliated with the Amal movement), and the Islamic Health Committee (affiliated with Hezbollah).

The building, located on an intersection in the northwestern area of Nabatieh called Hay al-Bayad, was completely destroyed, Faqih added, explaining that "dozens of close-by houses have been damaged, as well as dozens of cars."

According to our correspondent, Nabatieh had previously been targeted by drones, but never by the Israeli air force, which had, until now, targeted only the city’s outskirts.

Speaking to L'Orient Today, Iqbal Marwa, a supermarket owner in her fifties from the Al-Bayad neighborhood, said the balcony railings and doors in her house, just a few hundred meters from the airstrike, were shaking from the impact.

"I was on my balcony drinking coffee when I heard the sound of a missile being launched. Immediately after, I heard a huge explosion. Screams rose from the neighboring houses, and people went out onto their balconies, wondering where the explosion had occurred," she said.

"I did not expect my city to be bombed in this way. To be honest, I did not expect my house to be in the danger zone, yet I was not afraid," she said, ensuring that she intends to "stay in my home."

She explained she went to the site of the strike this morning and was "shocked by the extent of the destruction."

Faten Sabah, who was also close to the airstrike, told L'Orient Today that when she heard the sound of the fighter jets and "a sonic boom," she "took cover in a corner of the room and asked my daughter to take cover as well, fearing the windows would shatter."

"As soon as I said that, a massive explosion echoed for a few seconds, shaking the walls and doors."

"I will not leave my house because of one raid, and neither will my neighbors. This is what they said this morning. We agreed not to leave our homes and to monitor how the situation develops," Sabah said. She added sarcastically, "Where would we go with our pockets empty of money?"

In mid-February, notably, seven civilians from the same family were killed in a drone strike in Nabatieh. The Israeli army said the attack was conducted in retaliation for unclaimed rocket fire from Lebanon that hit a military base in northern Israel and killed one soldier.

המועצה האזורית מרום הגליל: לפני זמן קצר נורה טיל לעבר בית פרטי ביישוב אביבים שבמועצה האזורית מרום הגליל. נגרם נזק לבית, לא היו נפגעים.

ראש המועצה האזורית מרום הגליל עמית סופר: "עוד בית שניזוק באביבים. היישוב חטף עד כה עשרות טילים מסוגים שונים והנזקים לרכוש הם בהיקפים גדולים ומשמעותיים כך גם יישובים סמוכים. כל מתקפה כזו משפיעה על כל היישובים שלא פונו. אני מקווה שמינוי הפרויקטור ייבשר את הזרמת התקציבים והמענים הכה דחופים בצפון"

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

##### الصحفي محمد العويد ابن محافظة درعا، يتحدث لدرعا 24 عن تحديات وآفاق الإعلام السوري: نحو بناء إعلام حر ومستقل في مرحلة ما بعد النظام

**يشهد الإعلام السوري اليوم مرحلة مفصلية بعد سقوط النظام الذي أحكم قبضته على الصحافة ومؤسساتها لعقود طويلة**، ولا سيما خلال السنوات الثلاث عشرة الأخيرة. ومع هذا التحوّل، انفتح الباب أمام أفقٍ جديدٍ يطمح إليه الصحفيون والمؤسسات الإعلامية في سوريا، لتمكين العمل الإعلامي الحر والمستقل. ومع ذلك، فإن الطريق نحو تنظيم هذا القطاع وضمان حرية التعبير لا يزال مليئاً بالتحديات.

في هذا السياق **أجرت شبكة درعا 24 مقابلةً خاصّة مع الصحفي [محمد العويد](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100002329474787)
 من أبناء محافظة درعا**، للحديث عن هذا المشهد والكثير من الأمور المتعلقة به وتحديات وأولويات العمل الإعلامي في هذه المرحلة. يتناول الحوار قضايا مثل واقع الاتحادات التي أُنشئت مؤخرًا، وظروف الناشطين والصحفيين في البلاد، وأداء الحكومة في الجانب الإعلامي، والدور الذي يجب أن تضطلع به المؤسسات الصحفية لدعم التحول الإعلامي في سوريا.

**ينحدر الصحفي محمد العويد، من بلدة معربة في الريف الشرقي من محافظة درعا.** وهو خريج جامعة دمشق قسم الصحافة. عمل مديراً لفرع وكالة سانا في درعا، وفي صحف سورية أخرى قبل اندلاع الثورة في 2011. وعمل بعدها في تلفزيون “سوريا الشعب” الذي أُنشئ في عمّان في الأردن، حيث كان يقيم هناك. بعدها في تلفزيون “18 آذار” للمعارضة السورية. وفي عام 2014، هاجر إلى فرنسا. عمل من هناك مع تلفزيون “أورينت” كمراسل، وكذلك في موقع “زمان الوصل”. كما تعاون مع “تلفزيون سوريا”. وحالياً، ينشر مقالاته في عدد من المواقع الإلكترونية بصفة مستقلة، وليست دائمة.

كيف تُقيّم المشهد الإعلامي في سوريا اليوم بعد سقوط النظام الذي كان يُحكم قبضته بشكل كبير على الإعلام الرسمي وكل وسائل الإعلام في مناطق سيطرته؟ وما هي الآفاق التي تتطلع إليها من الإعلام السوري في المستقبل؟
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

أعتقد أن المشهد الإعلامي يعني – مرحليّاً – خلال هذه المرحلة لا يمكن تقييمه بالأدوات الطبيعية المعتادة؛ لأن الكل يشعرون أن هذه المرحلة هي مرحلة انتقالية، مرحلة تأتي بعد انهيار نظام الأسد وهروبه، وحل أكبر مؤسسات الدولة الأمنية والعسكرية. وبالتالي، **حالة الحرية – إذا جاز التعبير – في أوجها، في ذروتها، بدون أي ضوابط، بدون أي قواعد، في حالة من عدم المسؤولية الإعلامية.** لأن هناك سعة أفقية في انتشار الشائعات والمصادر غير المسؤولة، وعدم التأكد من الأخبار في حالة متناقضة بالقدر الذي نرى فيه الوجه الإعلامي الإيجابي من الحريات التي سادت في سوريا بعد فترة كبت طالت أكثر من عقود، نرى أيضاً غياب أدوات الدولة أو مؤسساتها التي يفترض أن تكون هي المصدر الرئيسي لفهم هذه التحولات، أو المصدر الرئيسي للأخبار التي تخاطب الناس أو تكون مصدراً للمعلومات منها.

كيف يمكن بناء إعلام يتمتع بالحرية في سوريا؟ وما هي التحديات التي تعيق تحقيق ذلك في المرحلة القادمة؟
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

بتقديري، أولاً، يفترض أن يتحمل الجميع المسؤولية كشارع، كصحفيين، كنخب سياسية، وأن تكون على قدر المسؤولية. لأن المرحلة لها خصوصيتها، وثانياً، الشكل الطبيعي أن تبادر الناس، أن تبادر هذه القوى المجتمعية في الإعلام والسياسة إلى إعادة ترتيب أوراقها، إعادة ترتيب أولوياتها. وأن تكون إذا لم تكن الشراكة متاحة الآن مع أدوات الدولة أو سلطة الدولة، فلتكن في الجهة المقابلة. لكن تقديري أنها تحتاج بعض الوقت، لأنه الأسباب الموضوعية لغياب هذه الكتل التي يفترض أن تكون صلب أو مقومات الحريات الإعلامية، إن واقع المعارضة بعد العام 2011 لم يكن خاضعاً بالمعنى الحقيقي لبنية المؤسسات. وإذا شاءت ووجدت مؤسسة، فهي تحكم جمهورها السوري المنتشر في أصقاع العالم، في كل دول العالم. **فالآليات التي كانت سائدة خلال فترة المعارضة وإعلامها هي أقرب لمرحلة الفوضى وليس التنظيم**، لأنه أنت لا تحكم في جغرافية محددة، أنت توجّه خطاباً، وردّ هذا الخطاب من الجمهور لا تخضع لأي قواعد.

الآن الفرصة الاستثنائية هي أنه **أصبح للسوريين وطن وجغرافيا يمكن الالتزام بقواعدها وآلياتها،** كما هو في بقية البلدان، بدءًا من الجوار السوري في الأردن أو الشمال التركي، وصولًا إلى دول العالم الآخر. فبتقديري أنه **يجب أن نكون صريحين مع أنفسنا وتتحمل هذه القوى الجديدة مسؤولياتها وأولوياتها وواجباتها ووظيفتها**، من خلال أولاً تنظيم صفوفها، ومن خلال أن تكون هي الرافع الحقيقي للحريات. ولا نعول وننتظر حتى تمنحنا السلطة الحريات على طبق من ذهب.

ما هي الأولويات العاجلة التي يجب على المؤسسات الإعلامية والجهات الفاعلة تحقيقها لضمان حرية الصحافة في سوريا الجديدة؟
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

أعتقد أن ترتيب هذه الأولويات سيكون مرهوناً بوجه السلطة القادمة. على الأقل خلال شهر آذار، سيتم إعلان تشكيل الحكومة، ومن المفترض أن يصدر عن هذا التشكيل لاحقاً – بالتوازي مع المؤتمر الوطني – البيان الدستوري. كما يُفترض أن يصدر معه بعض التعاميم أو القرارات التي تُحدد وتشرح وتؤطر مجموعة القوانين الناظمة للحياة السياسية والإعلامية. لأنه بدون هذا الجانب السياسي أولاً، لا يمكن للقوى السياسية أن تعمل.

بمعنى آخر، في الجانب الإعلامي، ما هي الأطر التي أعمل كصحفي بموجبها؟ هذه الأمور غير واضحة حالياً، لأنه ليس لدي أُطر ولا قوانين، والأمور متروكة الآن. لكن ا**لعاجل، بتقديري، هو أن تتولى القوى السياسية، ومن ضمنها القوى المدنية في الجانب الإعلامي، المسؤولية وأن تتهيأ لهذا الدور**. يجب أن تكون هذه القوى جاهزة، وأن تكون قادرة على ضم كوادرها والاستعداد للمرحلة القادمة. إذا لم تكن المؤسسات الإعلامية متاحة حالياً، فعلى الأقل في المرحلة القادمة، **يجب أن تكون هذه المؤسسات جاهزة إلى جانب المعارضة، وأن يكون لديها خطابها وبنودها التي ستطلبها من السلطة وتتناقش معها حولها،** سواء ما يتعلق بالإعلام أو بحريات الصحافة أو بالقانون الإلكتروني. كل هذه الأشياء يجب أن تبادر الجهات المدنية والصحفيين والنخبة الثقافية إلى تهيئة أوراقها، حتى تكون جاهزة في المرحلة القادمة.

**أعتقد أن أبرز تحدي حالياً هو تأخر السلطة السياسية في إعلان موقفها، على الأقل إعلامياً**. ما هي الأجواء التي ينبغي على الصحافة أن تعمل بموجبها. هل تترك بهذا الشكل غير المنضبط، ولكن في حدود معقولة؟ أم نعود إلى حالة من التنظيم؟ لأن أهم ما في الإعلام – إذا جاز التعبير بين هلالين – هو “لعبة المُشاكسة” مع الحكومة، وكل مُشاكسة تستوجب أن يكون هناك قواعد ضبط بين الطرفين. **للأسف، حتى الآن، غير واضح تماماً ما هي القواعد بين الطرفين. هل هو دستور 2012؟ هل هو قانون المطبوعات السوري؟** يبدو أن الأمور تُركت بهذا الشكل.

**لذلك، أعتقد أن أول الأولويات التي يجب أن تكون حاضرة وهو أن تتهيأ الأطراف المدنية لتلعب هذا الدور، وأن تكون على الأقل جاهزة فيما إذا ذهبت السلطة السياسية إلى اعتماد قانون ما. يجب أن يكون لديها النموذج المقنع والحضور الجماهيري.**

كيف يمكن للإعلام أن يساهم في بناء مستقبل سوريا الجديد؟ وما هو الدور الذي يجب أن تلعبه الحكومة لدعم هذا التوجه؟
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

جزء من وظيفة الإعلام دوماً أن يلعب دوراً محورياً في أي مجتمع، سواء في سوريا أو غيرها. وبالتأكيد، في الحالة السورية، هذا الدور مُضاعف بسبب الظروف الاستثنائية التي تمر بها البلاد. **في المجتمعات المستقرة، عادةً ما يلعب الإعلام دوراً ضمن قواعد السوق، حيث يكون الدافع هو السبق الصحفي، الشهرة، التسريبات، والعناوين المغرية** التي تجذب الجمهور وتزيد من انتشار المؤسسات الصحفية. هذه الممارسات تعتبر جزءاً من لعبة “العرض والطلب” في السوق الإعلامي.

لكن في الحالة السورية، الوضع مختلف تماماً. **أحد التحديات الرئيسية هو أن الإعلام يجب أن يضع القيمة الأخلاقية في أولوية عمله – أي خبر قد يخلق بلبلة كبيرة في المجتمع السوري -، خاصةً أن بنية الدولة ما زالت هشة وغير مستقرة.** لذلك، أعتقد أن سلم الأولويات في الحالة السورية يجب أن يختلف قليلاً، وأن يُراعى في الحالة السورية **أن تكون الأولوية للبناء وليس فقط للممارسات الإعلامية التي نراها في المجتمعات المستقرة**، والتي لديها باع طويل في تحمّل أعراف الصحافة الجديدة وحقها في السوق. في الحالة السورية، الوضع يحتاج من الإعلامي أن يرتب أولوياته بشكل مختلف، مع **التركيز بشكل خاص على الأولويات الأخلاقية للمهنة.** يجب أن يكون المقياس الأخلاقي والحالة الوطنية، أي: هل تتحمل الناس هذه الأنشطة الصحفية؟ التي عادةً ما تكون حق للصحفي.

بالتالي، لا بأس بتقديري من تعزيز هذه التوصيفات والبنية الأخلاقية في الصحافة، على الأقل مرحلياً، حتى يستقيم بنيان المجتمع السوري وتعود الصحافة إلى دورها الطبيعي.

ما تقييمك للخطوات التي اتخذتها الحكومة الجديدة فيما يتعلق بالإعلام؟ وكيف يمكن للإعلام أن يلعب دوراً رقابياً على أداء الحكومة في هذه المرحلة؟ وهل تتقبل الحكومة هذا الدور؟
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

بالنسبة للخطوات التي اتخذتها الحكومة، **حتى الآن لم تتخذ خطوات حقيقية**. ما نراه هو الطبيعي. بعد تحرير دمشق، حيث أن دمشق بأهميتها، التي تعتبر مأساة القرن، نحن أمام مشهد بالغ الأهمية من الطبيعي أن يستقطب كل الإعلام العالمي والمؤسسات الإعلامية. **أعتقد أن الإدارة المؤقتة ربما سهلت – إذا جاز التعبير – أو تعاطت مع الأمر بإيجابية، لأنها تريد إيصال رسالة مفادها أن هذه المرحلة تختلف عن مرحلة الأسد، التي كانت تتطلب الموافقات الأمنية وزيارات الفروع الأمنية،** وكانت هناك محدودية في قدرة الصحف والمؤسسات على العمل بحرية.

**الإدارة الجديدة قدمت رسالة سياسية أكثر من كونها إعلامية**، لأن الناس في الإعلام تنتظر بنية إعلامية وقانونية واضحة حتى تستطيع أن تستمر، وحتى تعرف ما هي الأرضية الصلبة التي تقف عليها. هذا الأمر ضروري حتى تستطيع أن تلعب دورها الرقابي على الإعلام، وهذا هو المطلوب. لكن موقف الحكومة حتى الآن – وهذا نعزوه للظرف الذي تمر به الإدارة الجديدة، وهي مرحلة انتقالية أو حتى ما قبل الانتقالية – لأنها استلمت بلداً ينوء من الخراب في كل هياكله، بما فيها الهياكل الإعلامية.

**سواء قبلت الحكومة الدور الرقابي للإعلام أم لم تقبله، فاعتقد أنه إذا استطاعت القوى الإعلامية والمنظمات الصحفية وكتلة الصحفيين والمثقفين أن تكون جاهزة ومنظمة لهذا الدور**، فسيقوم الإعلام بأداء دوره الرقابي بشكل طبيعي، ولكن ضمن الأطر والشروط التي سيتم الاتفاق عليها في المرحلة القادمة.

ما هي أبرز الأولويات التي يجب على الإعلاميين السوريين التركيز عليها خلال الفترة الانتقالية؟
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

فيما يتعلق بالأولويات، أعتقد أنه من الصعب أن أكون جزءاً من الحالة الصحفية وفي نفس الوقت أطالب بإنهاء حالة الفردية وتعزيز القيم الأخلاقية لمهنة الصحافة. أفهم أن الأمر ليس سهلاً، لأن الصحفي يعيش كما الشاعر ليقول فيها للناس: “ها أنا هنا كصحفي، لدي سبق، لدي تحقيق، لدي… إلخ”. لكن الحالة السورية، بما أنها حالة وطنية استثنائية، تستوجب سلم من الأولويات مختلفة قليلاً.

بدلاً من أن تكون الأولوية لدي كصحفي أو كمؤسسة إعلامية هي السبق الصحفي، يجب أن تكون الأولوية للقيمة الأخلاقية والمسؤولية الوطنية (كما أسلفت). هذا لا يعني إنهاء دوري كصحفي، بل يعني الانتقال من الحالة الفردية إلى حالة من المشاورة والتعاون مع زملائي في العمل ومع المؤسسة الإعلامية التي أنتمي إليها، ومؤسستي لديها تشبيك مع مؤسسات أخرى، وبالتالي نعيد ترتيب الأولويات بما يتناسب مع خصوصية الحالة السورية.

وهذا يعزز الدور المؤسساتي للإعلام ويعطي صورة أفضل من الصورة السابقة. قبل 13 سنة، **كنا نعيش حالة فردية، بل وحتى حالة فصائلية في الإعلام. الآن، نحن أمام حالة وطنية تستوجب الدقة والتعاون مع الآخرين أكثر من أي وقت مضى**. هذه الحالة تستوجب التركيز على القيم العليا، وأولها القيمة الوطنية وقيمة المواطنة والحريات. كل هذا يتطلب تخفيف حالة التفرد والذاتية التي نمارسها عادةً كصحفيين.

ما هو رأيك بالأفكار التي تدعو لإلغاء وزارة الإعلام – أسوةً بكثير من دول العالم – كخطوة لدعم حرية الصحافة؟ وهل تعتقد أن هناك بدائل أفضل لتنظيم القطاع الإعلامي؟
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

في قضية **الدعوة لإلغاء وزارة الإعلام، أعتقد أن هذا الطرح مبكرٌ جداً، خصوصاً في الحالة السورية**. صعوبة الأسئلة المطروحة اليوم، سواء كانت إعلامية أو سياسية أو دينية، وكل البرامج المقدمة، لا تراعي بشكل كافٍ الحالة الاستثنائية التي تمر بها سوريا. إذا نظرنا إلى دولة مستقرة مثل المملكة الأردنية، يمكن أن يثار نقاش حول إلغاء وزارة الإعلام، لأن هناك بنى مدنية ومؤسساتية قائمة منذ أكثر من خمسين سنة. لكن في الحالة السورية، الوضع مختلف تماماً.

**يجب أن نفهم خصوصية الحالة السورية البالغة الحساسية. القوى القادمة من المعارضة، والتي ستُدير البلد بشكل أو بآخر، لم تكن منضبطة خلال السنوات الـ13 الماضية**. كانت هذه القوى مشتتة. لكن لأول مرة الجغرافيا السورية ستتعامل معها ضمن أطر قانونية. أنا في فرنسا، ملتزم بقانون الإعلام الفرنسي، لكني لست ملتزماً بالقانون التركي. الآن، في سوريا، أصبحت ملتزماً بالحالة السورية ككل. لأول مرة، تتاح فرصة لأن يكون المرسل والمستقبل في جغرافية واحدة تحكمها القواعد نفسها. هذا يحتاج إلى تأطير وإنهاء المرحلة السابقة التي كانت قائمة على الفوضى وعدم الانضباط.

ليس هناك قانون يحكم العلاقة بين تلفزيون سوريا في تركيا (الذي يعمل في المنطقة الحرة ولا يخضع للقوانين التركية) وبين جمهوره في أمريكا أو لبنان أو الأردن أو حتى داخل سوريا. الآن، لأول مرة، يفترض أن تتاح لعبة إعلامية مهمة جداً، حيث **يلتزم كل من المرسل والمستقبل بقواعد تندرج تحت قانون الإعلام السوري والقانون العام السوري بضوابطه وقواعده وتعريفاته**. هذا يحتاج إلى جهد كبير حتى نعتاد عليه.

في المراحل القادمة، بعد استقرار الدولة، **إذا رأى أهل التشريع أن البلد لم تعد بحاجة إلى وزارة الإعلام، فليكن ذلك. أنا مع دعاة توسيع مجال الحرية بلا حدود أمام المؤسسات الإعلامية، لكن في الحالة السورية، أقف وأشعر بالخوف. هذه الحالة هي أكثر الحالات التي تستوجب الضبط والقوننة، وليس العكس.**

كيف ترى الخطوات التي تُتخذ اليوم التي تهدف لتوحيد الإعلاميين والصحفيين في عدة مناطق في سوريا وتأسيس اتحادات؟ هل ترى أن هذا يساهم في توحيد الخطاب الإعلامي وتنظيم العمل، أم أنها قد تؤدي إلى تهديد حرية التعبير وطمس التنوع الإعلامي؟
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

مسألة توحيد الإعلاميين وتأسيس اتحادات، الأصل في ذلك أنه مباح والضروري والمهم، **لكنني شخصياً متخوف من جملة المشهد الإعلامي ومعطيات المشهد السياسي**. عادةً، في بلاد الشتات، اعتدنا أن أي مجموعة تعمل اتحاداً، وهذا الاتحاد يشابه – للأسف – الحالة السياسية أو أي حالة أخرى من التجمعات السورية. السبب في ذلك هو إنّه لم يكن لدينا “بيت” بالمعنى الحقيقي، فكنا نلجأ إلى وسائل التواصل الاجتماعي والتعميمات المفتوحة، مع غياب القواعد الحقيقية.

**الخوف الآن هو من الاستسهال في المشهد السوري. بمعنى أنه غداً أو بعده، سنرى اتحادات صحفية في كل محافظة، وفي العاصمة دمشق، ستظهر اتحادات بأسماء متعددة**. المشكلة أن هذه الاتحادات، للأسف، هي استمرار للحالة السابقة، واستمرار للحالة التي كانت قائمة في الشتات. 

وهنا لا أريد أن يفهم كلامي كهجوم على أحد من زملائنا، **لكني أرى أن الإشكالية الحقيقية هي أننا نحاول صناعة “نمور من ورق” مجدداً، في حين أن الفرصة اليوم متاحة في دمشق لصناعة “نمور حقيقية”**.

بمعنى أن الراغبين في العمل السياسي والإعلامي، إصبح لدينا الآن وطن وبيت يمكننا اللقاء فيه، ولم نعد بحاجة إلى الأساليب القديمة التي تركت آثاراً سلبية. هذه فرصة حقيقية لبناء اتحادات قائمة على قواعد واضحة وفهم مشترك للآليات والدوافع.

النقطة الأهم هي أننا الآن أمام بيت، لكن الواجبات كثيرة. يجب أن نبدأ بتأثيث هذا البيت، تجميله، وتقديمه للجمهور. هل كل من في هذا البيت متوافق معك على الرؤية والقواعد والشروط والأولويات؟ من فهمي، أرى أن إشكالية الاتحادات التي تعلن عن نفسها بشكل متسارع تشبه إلى حد كبير القوى السياسية. ربما هذا بسبب خصوصية المرحلة، أو الظروف الراهنة، أو الرغبة في المشاركة، وهذا كله صحيح. لكن شخصياً، **أميل إلى أن قواعد وآليات تأسيس الاتحادات والروابط يجب أن تكون مختلفة عما يجري على أرض الواقع. لأنه لأول مرة سنكون أمام بُنى ستعتمد على ذاتها، وليس على دعم أو رعاية من هنا أو من هناك**. هذا البيت يجب أن يعتمد على اشتراكات الأعضاء. **هل الأعضاء في الحالة السورية جاهزون لهذا؟** أتمنى ذلك. هل الأعضاء سيكونون في حالة من الانضباط المؤسسي؟ أتمنى ذلك أيضاً.

بمعنى أن الاتحاد بهيكليته سيكون صاحب الموقف، وليس كل عضو بمفرده. الاتحاد سيكون ممثلاً للأعضاء، وهذه الجزئية لم نعتد عليها خلال السنوات الـ13 الماضية، حيث كانت الاتحادات التي نشأت عبارة عن صفحات تواصل اجتماعي، وبالتالي كانت أدوات ضبط الأعضاء غير ممكنة، فكيف تضبط أنا في فرنسا والآخر في تركيا والثالث في أمريكا والرابع في سوريا. الفرصة الآن هي أن أصبح هناك بيت يجمع الجميع، وهي فرصة تاريخية. لكن يجب أن نبادر كصحفيين إلى استثمار أقصى طاقاتنا في هذا الجانب.

ما أبرز التحديات التي تواجه الصحفيين في درعا في المرحلة الحالية، وكيف يمكن للإعلام المحلي أن يساهم في إيصال صوت المجتمعات المحلية للحكومة وللعالم؟ وما هو مستقبل العمل الصحفي في درعا وسوريا؟
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

فيما يتعلق بوضع درعا، هي جزء من الكل السوري. إذا استطاعت درعا أن تواكب الحالة الإعلامية السورية العامة، فهذا أمر جيد ويُحسب لها. بالتأكيد، أ**ي إعلام محلي يساهم في وصول صوت جمهوره أو المجتمع المحلي الذي يحاول أن يكون صوته.**

التحديات في درعا تشبه التحديات في المشهد الإعلامي السوري ككل. مرة أخرى، نحن أمام لحظة فارقة: أصبح لديك بيت بعد أن كان أعضاء هذا البيت، من الأب إلى الأبناء، مشتتين في كل أنحاء العالم. ولأول مرة، يستوجب بناء هذا البيت حضور الجميع ومشاركة الجميع. لكن يبدو أن ثمة ظروفاً أو معيقات ستكون عائقاً أمام اكتمال هذه العائلة. هذه المشكلة تنطبق على الحالة الصحفية في درعا، كما تنطبق على الحالة الصحفية في عموم سوريا.

بمعنى، ماذا عن الزملاء الآخرين؟ هل سيعودون؟ هذا غير واضح. وماذا عن المؤسسات القائمة وكوادرها؟ ما هي الخيارات ؟ هذا أيضاً غير واضح. وماذا عن النشطاء الذين هم جزء كبير من المشهد الإعلامي السوري اليوم؟ حملوا أرواحهم على أيديهم وضحوا، ولدينا تضحيات جسيمة، نقف أمامها بإجلال. لكنه سؤال مرّ يحتاج إلى وضوح وإجابة: **ماذا تفعل أمام كتلة لا يستهان بها من الشباب من النشطاء الإعلاميين؟ ما هي الخيارات؟ هل تقول لهم “كفيتم ووفيتم”؟ بالتأكيد، هذا لا يستقيم. يجب أن نستفيد من تجربتهم، أولاً هذا حقهم أن يكونوا جزءاً من المشهد القادم، لكن ضمن أي شروط؟ ضمن أي معطيات؟**

كل هذه الأسئلة تشكل تحديات كبيرة تحتاج إلى إجابات. وأنا بتقديري أن الأهم هو أن تكون هذه المجموعة أو هؤلاء الصحفيين هم من يثيروا هذه الأسئلة، وهم من يعبر عن أدواتهم، ويعرفوا عن هويتهم. كل هذه الأسئلة يفترض أن يصوغوها هم، بمساعدة الآخرين، بمساعدة زملائهم السابقين، وبالتشبيك بين بعضهم. لكن عليهم هم أن يثيروا هذه الأسئلة.

ما هي رسالة محمد العويد للصحفيين في درعا؟ وكيف يمكنهم أن يكونوا أكثر فاعلية في المشهد؟
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

أعتقد أن المهم جداً هو أن يعمل كل ناشط، كل مواطن صحفي، وكل مهتم بالشأن الإعلامي في المحافظة، ويبادر بالتشبيك مع الآخرين من زملائه. **المهم الآن هو أن يفهم الجميع أن الأصوات الفردية لن يكون لها جدوى في المرحلة القادمة**، حتى لو كان مشهور أو ذو باع طويل لن يحقق شيئاً، لأن الأصوات الفردية لن تكون ذات جدوى أمام هذا المشهد بالغ التطور والمتسارع، والذي يعاد بناؤه في سوريا.

المشروع بهذا الحجم، على مستوى الوطن السوري، يحتاج بالمقابل إلى أن يكون هناك روافد أو أجنحة، وليس حالات فردية. **أنا من دعاة الحالة الجماعية في هذا المعنى. للصحفيين في درعا، وللمهتمين بالشأن الإعلامي**، أن تكون الدعوة دائمة إلى لقاءات دائمة على مدار الشهر أو الأسبوع، يتم فيها طرح هذه الأسئلة، تبدأ من الهوية: من نحن؟ ماذا ينتظرنا؟ ما هي حقوقنا؟ كيف نعمل؟ ما هي مصلحتنا؟ أن نشبك مع بعضنا البعض؟ هل نعمل كأفراد؟ كل هذه الأسئلة واستحقاقاتها مهمة، وأعتقد أنه يجب أن يكون هناك محاولات للحصول على أجوبة لها، وليس أن تبقى مجرد أسئلة في الفضاء المفتوح. لأن التحديات كبيرة، والحقوق كثيرة. بدلاً من الحالة الفردية، التي من مشاكلها أنها تقبل أحياناً باللا شيء (مثلاً، أن تكون مراسلاً في درعا لمؤسسة في دمشق وأن يُقبل)، لكن بالحالة الجمعية أن يسأل ويكون خلفه مؤسسة أو مجموعة تسأل ما هي حقوقه.

يجب أن نعي أن المرحلة القادمة، حتى في حالة المواطن الصحفي، لم يعد من المقبول التطوع. العمل الإعلامي يجب أن ينتهي بهذه الطريقة. **العمل الإعلامي هو عمل يومي، مضني، إشكالي، بجوانبه المتعددة قانوني، وأحياناً يضعك في مواجهة السلطة أو الشارع.** كل هذه الأشياء يجب أن يكون ما يحميها، بدءاً من الجانب التعويض المالي وصولاً إلى الحقوق داخل المؤسسة التي تعمل بها.

لذلك، أنا أميل إلى ضرورة الحالة الجمعية بين الناس والتكاتف فيما بينها، وإثارة كل هذه الأسئلة. في المشهد السابق، **هناك متطوعون، وشهدنا مئات وعشرات الشهداء الذين لا نعرف الآن من هي المؤسسات أو الجهات التي ستعنى بهم أو بعوائلهم أو بأبنائهم**. مرحلة الاستقرار في سوريا اليوم تختلف. إذا كنت مواطناً صحفياً، يجب أن تسأل أولاً: ما هي حقوقي لدى المؤسسة التي أتعامل معها أو التي أتطوع لأجلها؟ هذا أبسط الأسئلة. لم يعد المشهد كما في السابق، حيث كنا نعتمد على العفوية أو النخوة. الآن، انتقلنا إلى مرحلة المأسسة. المأسسة تختلف، لأنك تتعامل مع مؤسسة، وأولى الأشياء التي يجب أن تُطرح هي: ما هي حقوقي؟ ما هي واجباتي؟ ماذا عليّ؟ وماذا لكم؟ هذه الأسئلة تريح الطرفين وتساعد على بناء علاقة مستقرة وطويلة الأمد.

**من وجهة نظري، يفترض أن يتعاون الجميع في هذه المرحلة. هذه واحدة من التحديات، وربما أهمها.**

قصف إسرائيلي على أهداف سورية - صورة أرشيقية من موقع المرصد السوري

أعلنت وزارة الدفاع السورية تفاصيل العدوان الجوي الذي شنته قوات الاحتلال، اليوم السبت، على العاصمة دمشق.

وقالت وزارة الدفاع السورية، في ما نشرته على لسان مصدر عسكري عبر صفحتها الرسمية على موقع فيسبوك، أنه في «حوالي الساعة 1:35 من فجر اليوم السبت، نفذ العدو الإسرائيلي عدوانا جويا من اتجاه الجولان السوري المحتل مستهدفا بعض النقاط في محيط مدينة دمشق».

وأضاف المصدر: «تصدت وسائط دفاعنا الجوي لصواريخ العدوان وأسقطت معظمها، واقتصرت الخسائر على الماديات».

بيان وزارة الدفاع السورية

وفي وقت سابق، اليوم السبت، ذكرت وسائل الإعلام الرسمية السورية أن إسرائيل شنت هجوما جويا على محيط العاصمة السورية دمشق.

كما أفادت وسائل الإعلام السورية بسماع دوي انفجارات متتالية في دمشق.

وذكر موقع روسيا اليوم أن الدفاعات الجوية السورية نجحت في التصدى لأهداف معادية في أجواء محيط العاصمة دمشق، موضحا أن الانفجارات القوية بدأت في الساعة 01:35 بتوقيت دمشق، مشيرا إلى أنها استمرت دقائق عدة.

#### **غزة تواجه الإبادة**

ولليوم الـ57، يواصل الاحتلال عدوانه على قطاع غزة الذي بدأ في السابع من أكتوبر/ تشرين الأول، بعد قيام المقاومة الفلسطينية بتنفيذ عملية طوفان الأقصى، بمنطقة غلاف غزة، وبعد انتهاء الهدنة الإنسانية المؤقتة في القطاع، صباح يوم الجمعة، وهو اليوم الـ56 للعدوان.

وتتواصل الغارات التي تشنها مقاتلات الاحتلال، مما أدى إلى ارتقاء آلاف الشهداء والجرحى.

وأعلن المكتب الإعلامي الحكومي في غزة، أمس الجمعة، ارتفاع عدد الشهداء إلى 15 ألفا و110 فلسطينيين، بينهم 6150 طفلا و4000 سيدة.

وذكر المكتب الحكومي، في بيان، أن عدد شهداء الكوادر الطبية بلغ نحو 207 أطباء وممرضين ومسعفين، كما استشهد 73 صحفيا.

وزاد إجمالي عدد الإصابات عن 37 ألف حالة، أكثر من 75% منهم من الأطفال والنساء.

وأوضح أن إجمالي عدد البلاغات عن المفقودين تحت الأنقاض بلغ 6500 بلاغ، فيما بلغ إجمالي عدد الوحدات السكنية التي تضررت كليا أو جزئيا 300 ألف وحدة، إلى جانب استهداف 266 مدرسة، وخروج 26 مستشفى من الخدمة فضلا عن تدمير 56 سيارة إسعاف.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that Israel did bomb military targets in southern Syria outside Damascus in February 2025. The image in the claim was found in an article from Alghad News, published on December 2, 2023, reporting on an Israeli air attack on Damascus. Therefore, the claim is partially supported by the evidence. However, the evidence does not confirm that the image shows the destruction of the last remaining army depots.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The Times of Israel ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/drones-moans-and-groans-hezbollah-attacks-pms-home-petty-politics-continue-unintercepted/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/drones-moans-and-groans-hezbollah-attacks-pms-home-petty-politics-continue-unintercepted/)) provides an image of people standing behind a barrier <image:7739>. NewsMobile.in ([https://www.newsmobile.in/nm-fact-checker/fact-check-israeli-pm-benjamin-netanyahus-son-yair-killed-in-hezbollah-drone-attack-heres-the-truth/](https://www.newsmobile.in/nm-fact-checker/fact-check-israeli-pm-benjamin-netanyahus-son-yair-killed-in-hezbollah-drone-attack-heres-the-truth/)) includes an image with text stating that Shin Bet confirms the assassination of Yair Netanyahu in Caesarea <image:7740>.


## Elaboration
The evidence presents conflicting information. One source ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/drones-moans-and-groans-hezbollah-attacks-pms-home-petty-politics-continue-unintercepted/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/drones-moans-and-groans-hezbollah-attacks-pms-home-petty-politics-continue-unintercepted/)) shows an image related to a drone attack on the PM's home. However, another source ([https://www.newsmobile.in/nm-fact-checker/fact-check-israeli-pm-benjamin-netanyahus-son-yair-killed-in-hezbollah-drone-attack-heres-the-truth/](https://www.newsmobile.in/nm-fact-checker/fact-check-israeli-pm-benjamin-netanyahus-son-yair-killed-in-hezbollah-drone-attack-heres-the-truth/)) includes an image with text stating that Shin Bet confirmed the assassination of Yair Netanyahu.

The claim cannot be fully verified. The evidence suggests a drone attack on the PM's home and an assassination of Yair Netanyahu, but it does not explicitly link the two events. More information is needed to confirm if Yair Netanyahu was killed in a drone attack.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

## Elaboration
The evidence does not provide any confirmation of Yair Netanyahu's death. The images show Yair Netanyahu, but they do not provide any information about his death.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The initial search results present conflicting information, with one source mentioning a drone attack and another referencing an assassination. However, the second search did not provide any confirmation of Yair Netanyahu's death. Therefore, there is not enough information to verify the claim.

You are provided with the record of a fact-check. It contains the Claim to be verified and a documentation of all the fact-checking work along the gathered evidence. Your task is to **summarize the fact-check**. That is, you provide a concise, one-paragraph justification for the final VERDICT based on the knowledge from the Record. Note:
* Be truthful, brief, do not add any additional information besides the information given in the Record. 
* Link key sources in your summary. Use Markdown notation for that. You may link them in-line.
* Don't state the Claim again. Rather focus on the key insights of the fact-check.
* Simply print just the summary.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "Netanyahu’s son Yair was killed in a drone attack on October 19, 2024 that targeted the Israeli PM’s home in Caesarea, Israel."

## Actions
```
image_search("Yair Netanyahu drone attack Caesarea October 19 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The Times of Israel ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/drones-moans-and-groans-hezbollah-attacks-pms-home-petty-politics-continue-unintercepted/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/drones-moans-and-groans-hezbollah-attacks-pms-home-petty-politics-continue-unintercepted/)) provides an image of people standing behind a barrier <image:7739>. NewsMobile.in ([https://www.newsmobile.in/nm-fact-checker/fact-check-israeli-pm-benjamin-netanyahus-son-yair-killed-in-hezbollah-drone-attack-heres-the-truth/](https://www.newsmobile.in/nm-fact-checker/fact-check-israeli-pm-benjamin-netanyahus-son-yair-killed-in-hezbollah-drone-attack-heres-the-truth/)) includes an image with text stating that Shin Bet confirms the assassination of Yair Netanyahu in Caesarea <image:7740>.


## Elaboration
The evidence presents conflicting information. One source ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/drones-moans-and-groans-hezbollah-attacks-pms-home-petty-politics-continue-unintercepted/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/drones-moans-and-groans-hezbollah-attacks-pms-home-petty-politics-continue-unintercepted/)) shows an image related to a drone attack on the PM's home. However, another source ([https://www.newsmobile.in/nm-fact-checker/fact-check-israeli-pm-benjamin-netanyahus-son-yair-killed-in-hezbollah-drone-attack-heres-the-truth/](https://www.newsmobile.in/nm-fact-checker/fact-check-israeli-pm-benjamin-netanyahus-son-yair-killed-in-hezbollah-drone-attack-heres-the-truth/)) includes an image with text stating that Shin Bet confirmed the assassination of Yair Netanyahu.

The claim cannot be fully verified. The evidence suggests a drone attack on the PM's home and an assassination of Yair Netanyahu, but it does not explicitly link the two events. More information is needed to confirm if Yair Netanyahu was killed in a drone attack.


## Actions
```
image_search("Yair Netanyahu death confirmation")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/17/netanyahus-son-banned-from-facebook-over-hate-speech](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/17/netanyahus-son-banned-from-facebook-over-hate-speech)) includes an image of Benjamin Netanyahu and his son, Yair <image:7747>. The Times of Israel ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/yair-netanyahu-hints-those-who-put-father-on-trial-should-face-death-penalty/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/yair-netanyahu-hints-those-who-put-father-on-trial-should-face-death-penalty/)) provides an image of Yair Netanyahu <image:7748>. NBC News ([https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna43527563](https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna43527563)) provides an image of Yair Netanyahu with his father <image:7749>.


## Elaboration
The evidence does not provide any confirmation of Yair Netanyahu's death. The images show Yair Netanyahu, but they do not provide any information about his death.


## Actions
```
image_search("Yair Netanyahu death hoax")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.voanews.com/a/middle-east_israeli-leaders-son-takes-center-stage-corruption-sagas/6192260.html): 
Content: The Voice of America ([https://www.voanews.com/a/middle-east_israeli-leaders-son-takes-center-stage-corruption-sagas/6192260.html](https://www.voanews.com/a/middle-east_israeli-leaders-son-takes-center-stage-corruption-sagas/6192260.html)) provides an image of Yair Netanyahu with his father <image:7760>.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the claim is false. The search results do not provide any credible information about Yair Netanyahu's death. The images show Yair Netanyahu alive.


## Final Judgement
The initial search revealed conflicting information, with one source mentioning a drone attack and another a claim of assassination. However, subsequent searches did not provide any confirmation of Yair Netanyahu's death. The images show Yair Netanyahu alive. Therefore, the claim is not factually accurate. `false`


## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is false. While there were reports of a drone attack and an assassination claim, subsequent searches did not confirm Yair Netanyahu's death. Images show him alive, and no credible sources support the claim.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
Euronews published an article on September 5, 2024, about protesters in Tel Aviv marching with makeshift coffins (<image:7775>). Al Jazeera published an article that includes an image of a coffin being carried by people, with Israeli police present (<image:7776>). Ynetnews.com published an article about a protest (<image:7777>).


# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that the image depicts a protest involving coffins draped with the Israeli flag. The Euronews article from September 5, 2024, confirms that such a protest took place in Tel Aviv. The image search results do not confirm that the coffins contained dead Israeli soldiers.

Based on the evidence, the claim is likely false. The image shows coffins used in a protest, but there is no evidence to confirm that they contained dead Israeli soldiers.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

A [post](https://archive.ph/LKIoV)
 shared on Threads with an image purportedly of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s home, taken by a Hezbollah drone in August 2024, is MISSING CONTEXT.

The post reads, “BREAKING Netanyahu’s residence in Caesarea has been filmed by a drone belonging to the Lebanese Hezbollah — Israel Hayom.”

The image was also shared on X (formerly Twitter) with similar claims in a [post](https://archive.ph/7EBDu)
 reading, “Netanyahu’s residence has been filmed by a Hezbollah drone…On target.”

According to media [reports](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/hezbollah-drone-suspected-of-filming-netanyahus-home-report/3307013)
, a suspected [Hezbollah](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/what-hezbollah)
 drone that was purportedly filming Netanyahu’s home in Caesarea on 18 August 2024 was dismissed as a false alarm. The Lebanese militant group allied with [Hamas](https://apnews.com/article/hamas-hezbollah-houthis-iran-militant-groups-745bfc36e23997ee3f0bc499a9f5c16d)

 war in the Middle East.

A Google Lens reverse image [search](https://archive.ph/BOoER)
 established the image in question predates current events.

The image was featured in a 25 June 2020 [article](https://www.timesofisrael.com/why-exactly-have-israelis-been-ordered-to-pay-netanyahus-taxes/)
 by _Times of Israel_ with the headline, “Why, exactly, have Israelis been ordered to pay Netanyahu’s taxes?”

The image, labelled as a screenshot, is attributed to _Kan_ public broadcaster and captioned: “Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s private residence in Caesarea.”

_KAN_ featured the image in a YouTube [video](https://youtu.be/k_VMJvSd8v0)
 uploaded on 1 July 2019.

The video’s title, translated from Hebrew, reads, “The villa in Caesarea: The Netanyahu family insists that the state finance the sealing works.”

The claim is not supported by the evidence. The image predates the claim and was featured in a 2020 article and a 2019 YouTube video. The image is of Benjamin Netanyahu’s private residence in Caesarea.

_________________________



JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.17, 'Mexico': 0.15, 'Tunisia': 0.11, 'Malta': 0.1, 'Palestine': 0.07, 'Bermuda': 0.05, 'Jordan': 0.05, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.04, 'Dominican Republic': 0.03, 'Pakistan': 0.03}

### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (<image:53>) is of Benjamin Netanyahu’s private residence in Caesarea. The image predates the claim and was featured in a 2020 article by _Times of Israel_ and a YouTube video from 2019.

The image was found on the website [PesaCheck](https://pesacheck.org/missing-context-this-image-of-israeli-prime-minister-benjamin-netanyahus-home-was-not-captured-by-9d48e97d86b7) and on the [Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/topic/prime-ministers-residence/).


### Evidence from `image_search`
The Aviationist reports on an attack on Benjamin Netanyahu's house (<image:7790>). The Australian reports that a Hezbollah drone cracked a bedroom window at Netanyahu's home (<image:7791>). Siasat.com reports that a Hezbollah drone filmed Benjamin Netanyahu's residence (<image:7792>).

KIEL, Germany (June 19, 2024) – The Blue Ridge-class command and control ship USS Mount Whitney (LCC 20) arrived in Kiel, Germany, for a scheduled port visit, June 19, 2024.  
  
The ship’s visit to Kiel completes its participation in Baltic Operations (BALTOPS) 24, and builds on the strong and enduring relationship between the United States and Germany. BALTOPS 24 is an annual joint, multinational maritime-focused exercise designed to enhance interoperability, capability, and cohesion among NATO Allies while maintaining freedom of navigation and defending the Baltic Sea region. USS Mount Whitney’s visit to Kiel marks the culmination of its participation in BALTOPS 24 as it travels across the Baltic Sea.  
  
During the USS Mount Whitney’s port visit, Sailors, Marines, and key leaders from the Baltic Region participated in a Post-Sail conference at the Kiel Naval Base, where the discussions centered around capturing the lessons learned from BALTOPS 24, as well as beginning to shape the subsequent iterations of BALTOPS. BALTOPS is an annual training exercise in the Baltic region, with each year building off of the progress from the previous years.  
  
For the duration of BALTOPS 24, Task Force 61/2 (TF 61/2) and Expeditionary Strike Group 2 (ESG-2) combined together as Commander Task Force 162 (CTF 162). CTF 162 was aboard the USS Mount Whitney, which served as the command and control center for the amphibious assault ship USS Wasp (LHD 1), the San Antonio-class amphibious transport dock USS New York (LPD 21) and embarked 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU), Special Operations Capable (SOC), all together referred to as the Wasp ARG-24th MEU (SOC). Embarked commands with the Wasp ARG consist of Amphibious Squadron Four, 24th MEU (SOC), Fleet Surgical Team 2, Tactical Air Control Squadron 22, Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron 28 and Beach Assault Unit 21.  
  
TF 61/2 was also working closely with NATO Allies throughout BALTOPS 24, to include members of the Spanish Navy aboard the multi-purpose amphibious assault ship-aircraft carrier Juan Carlos I (L 61), the Royal Netherlands Navy aboard the HNLMS Johan de Witt (L 801), and the French Navy aboard the Mistral class amphibious assault and command ship (L 9013).  
  
“The purpose of this \[BALTOPS\] is to enhance our relationships, it’s to continue to build on our interoperability, it’s to showcase the fact that we are committed to this Alliance, and that we are committed to maintaining maritime peace and stability in the Baltic region,” said Brig. Gen. Samuel Meyer, the Commanding General of TF 61/2, who served as the Commander, Landing Forces (CLF) for CTF 162 during BALTOPS 24. “We are indeed stronger together.”  
  
For the last two weeks, TF 61/2 and ESG-2 were underway on the USS Mount Whitney participating in BALTOPS 24. As one of NATO’s premier maritime-focused exercises, BALTOPS 24 aimed to enhance interoperability and cooperation among allied nations in a complex and dynamic maritime environment. BALTOPS 24 was divided into two at-sea training phases. Combat Enhancement Training (CET) and Force Integration Training (FIT) comprised the first phase, followed by the Final Tactical Phase of the Exercise (TACEX). During the CET/FIT phase, ships and aircraft rehearsed common tactics, techniques, and procedures under a scripted program of events, enabling them to safely operate together as a force. The exercise culminated with the TACEX phase, where forces shifted into a “free-play” portion, and commanders were given more freedom to run their own tactical programs. The TACEX phase was designed to better represent operating in real-world situations.  
  
Participating nations included Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Türkiye, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The exercise, in its 53rd iteration, provided a unique training opportunity that strengthened combined response capabilities critical to preserving the freedom of navigation and security in the Baltic Sea region. Participating nations exercised a myriad of capabilities that demonstrated the inherent flexibility of maritime forces, including amphibious operations, gunnery, anti-submarine, and air defense exercises, as well as mine clearance operations, explosive ordnance disposal, and diving and salvage operations.  
  
“What we practice together is the ability to be interoperable with NATO, and this is a fantastic thing that I believe NATO does better than anyone else, and it really showcases the ability to work together,” says Rear Adm. Benjamin Nicholson, the commander of ESG-2, serving as the Commander, Amphibious Task Force (CATF) for CTF 162 during BALTOPS 24. “This really highlights the interoperability of NATO, where we can take forces from one nation, and put them on a ship or in a country of another nation, and operate from there seamlessly. That’s our strength when we partner and work together because we are stronger together.”  
  
Unique to BALTOPS 24 was Sweden participating for the first time as a member of NATO. Sweden had participated in previous iterations of BALTOPS as a NATO partner, but BALTOPS 24 was the first time that Sweden participated as an official member of NATO. This year also included a robust medical training package, together with a mass casualty medical drill on several of the ships underway, complete with role players simulating injuries wearing realistic makeup that were treated by the ship’s corpsman and medical officers, showcasing the medical readiness of the ships’ medical teams. Additionally, BALTOPS 24 included a larger chaplaincy contribution in the exercise that was expanded to six participating nations, integrating the chaplains in the military exercises to practice spiritually supporting our key warfare advantage: our service members. Chaplains from Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Netherlands, Norway, Romania, and the United States participated in the exercise, and conducted several cross-deckings to other NATO surface ships, where they met with the service members on board and led religious services.  
  
These various training evolutions contributed to this year’s successful iteration of BALTOPS 24. Participants in this multinational maritime exercise created and sustained partnerships and practiced a broad range of mission areas to enhance the capabilities of the participating units. More importantly, this exercise strengthened their ability to operate as a cohesive joint and combined force and respond to emerging crises.  
  
Headquartered in Naples, Italy, U.S. Naval Forces Europe-Africa (NAVEUR-NAVAF) operates U.S. naval forces in the U.S. European Command (USEUCOM) and U.S. Africa Command (USAFRICOM) areas of responsibility. U.S. Sixth Fleet is permanently assigned to NAVEUR-NAVAF, and employs maritime forces through the full spectrum of joint and naval operations.  
  
For more than 80 years, NAVEUR-NAVAF has forged strategic relationships with Allies and partners, leveraging a foundation of shared values to preserve security and stability.

German Reconnaissance Company

WASHINGTON  –  

For 75 years, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has been a force for peace that stared down the Soviet Union, prevented a larger war in the Balkans, joined in the fight against international terrorism and even now stands ready to defend all NATO territory from Russian aggression.

NATO remains a vital and crucial alliance, and leaders of political parties on both sides of the Atlantic agree that NATO must be deemed one of the most successful collective defense alliances in history.

The alliance grew out of the experiences of the 20th century when great power wars killed more than 100 million people. Western leaders put in place an international order to prevent that sort of cataclysm from happening again. Part of that order was NATO — a collective defense alliance.

President Joe Biden called NATO "the greatest military alliance in the history of the world." Since NATO's founding, U.S. officials of both political parties have credited the alliance with contributing to the security, prosperity and liberty of Americans — and the world. 

And polling this year by the Pew Research Center shows that, though roughly two-thirds of Americans hold a favorable view of NATO — still, that means a third of Americans hold unfavorable opinions about the alliance — a 4% increase since 2023.

This growing increase in isolationist sentiment in the United States is disturbing to leaders of the NATO nations.

Isolationism has a long history in the United States. In 1796, President George Washington wrote in his farewell address that "It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliance with any portion of the foreign world." He said this even though Washington probably knew better than most Americans that without an alliance with France in the American Revolution, Britain would have won.

When the United States entered [World War I](https://www.defense.gov/Spotlights/WWI/)
 in April 1917, it fought as an "associated" power alongside France and the United Kingdom. The associated power label still left some distance between the U.S. and any entangling alliance.

After the war, American isolationism in the 1920s and 1930s, in part, laid the groundwork for a far more destructive war.

During [World War II](https://www.defense.gov/Spotlights/WWII/)
, the U.S. was a full ally, alongside the U.K., the Soviet Union, China, France and many others.

That war was so horrific, and the weapons created so destructive, that there was vast support for collective defense. A total of 420,000 Americans were killed in World War II, with many, many more wounded. And the U.S. was fortunate compared to other Allies. The Soviet Union lost up to 25 million and the U.K. — with less than a third of the U.S. population — lost 450,900. Overall, officials estimate that 3% of the Earth's population died in World War II.

Moving forward, the development of atomic weapons meant those casualties would look small if the great powers were to go to war again.

The alliance may seem inevitable. But, as Biden said in remarks commemorating NATO's 75th anniversary, this success didn't happen by accident, nor was it inevitable.

**Candy vs. Communism**

NATO came into being with the signing of the Washington Treaty on April 9, 1949. The original members of the alliance were Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the U.K. and the U.S.

Even as Western leaders signed the treaty, U.S. and allied aircrews were winning the first battle of the Cold War: The Berlin Airlift.

At the end of World War II, the victorious Allied powers administered Germany — with the Americans in the South, the British to the North, the French in the Southwest and the Soviets in the East.

Berlin was a special case. Each of the four powers had a sector in the former Nazi capital, which was deep inside the Soviet quarter. On June 24, 1948, the Soviets cut off Allied ground, rail and river routes into the city.

The allies — primarily the U.S. — answered with a massive airlift called Operation Vittles that supplied the city of more than 2 million people with food, milk, medical supplies and coal. Aircraft landed with metronome-like regularity. Logisticians loaded and unloaded the aircraft with metronomic precision. The operation delivered more than 2.3 million tons of supplies on more than 277,000 flights into the besieged city through September 1949.

The flights brought in more than just necessities. Aircrews noticed children would gather to watch the planes land. One pilot, Air Force 1st Lt. Gail Halvorsen, attached parachutes to Hershey bars and launched them to the children. He became known as "the Candy Bomber." The gesture gave heart to Berliners of all ages. And it highlighted the difference between the two systems. While the Soviets wouldn't let milk for babies through a blockade, the Americans were dropping candy bars to children.

**Article 5**

The key to the Washington Treaty is Article 5, which pledges a collective response to an attack on any single member.

It goes like this, "The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defense recognized by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force."

The treaty never mentions the Soviet Union, but there was little doubt about who was the threat. NATO's first secretary general — Britain's Lord Ismay — said the alliance's purpose was "to keep the Soviet Union out, the Americans in, and the Germans down."

The alliance became a true deterrent to the Soviet Union. Proof of that came in 1955 when the Soviet Union created the Warsaw Pact. This was a forced pact of captive nations in the Soviet orbit formed in response to NATO.

NATO stood united when the Soviets crushed a rebellion in Hungary in 1956 when they erected the Berlin Wall in 1961, and when they crushed the democratic movement in Czechoslovakia in 1968.

While the Soviet Union denigrated NATO, claiming nations would do better for themselves in the Soviet orbit, the alliance continued to grow. In 1952, Greece and Turkey joined, and in 1955, West Germany. Spain joined in 1982.

This solidarity worked. The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 shredded the Iron Curtain. Three years later the Soviet Union itself imploded, and the nations of Eastern and Central Europe were free to choose their own courses. A total of 14 former communist nations — from Albania to Slovenia — hurried to join NATO.

**Shared Democratic Values**

NATO is more than a simple alliance of 32 nations. NATO countries share similar world views. "Today, we once more reaffirm that our shared democratic values — and our willingness to stand up for them — is what makes NATO the greatest military alliance in the history of the world," Biden said in March as he welcomed NATO's newest member, Sweden, into the alliance. "It is what draws nations to our cause. It is what underpins our unity."

NATO is not just the largest peacetime military alliance in the world, it is integral to American interests and well-being.

"Generation after generation, the United States and our fellow allies have chosen to come together to stand up for freedom and push back against aggression — knowing we are stronger, and the world is safer when we do," Biden said in a statement celebrating the 75th anniversary of NATO's founding.

**Relevant Today**

Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 highlighted NATO's importance. "Almost two years after Putin's [unprovoked invasion of Ukraine](https://www.defense.gov/Spotlights/Support-for-Ukraine/)
 — the most serious threat to transatlantic security in decades — NATO has grown stronger and more united than ever," Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III said following a meeting of defense ministers at NATO headquarters in Brussels this February.

If Putin is successful and Russia is able to conquer a neighboring nation — forcefully deposing a freely elected government — then other neighboring nations may be endangered.  "Putin is not going to stop at Ukraine," President Biden said alongside French President Emmanuel Macron after talks in Paris on June 8. "All of Europe will be threatened, we are not going to let that happen."  

The European NATO allies are aware of the dangers posed by Putin's expansionist tendencies. In 2014, when Russia first invaded Ukraine and occupied Crimea, only three NATO member states had achieved the alliance's goal of 2% of gross domestic product devoted to defense. This year, 24 nations are expected to at least make the 2% level and many nations are taking that percentage of expenditures as the floor, not the ceiling for defense appropriations. Last year saw the ninth consecutive rise in European and Canadian defense spending. And in 2024, NATO members in Europe will invest a total of $470 billion in defense.

So, what makes NATO worthwhile to the United States? After all, at 1.3 million active duty service members, almost 770,000 Reservists and a $800 billion budget, the U.S. has the largest, best-funded military in NATO.

On the other hand, Russia has roughly 1.15 million active-duty personnel and another 800,000 reservists.

But the alliance is about more than how many troops any one nation can bring to the fight.

NATO's members have a collective defense budget that's north of $1.2 trillion. NATO nations share advanced training, tactics, equipment and often, weapons platforms. There are also NATO's overflight agreements, basing arrangements, intelligence-sharing protocols, common command structures and day-to-day familiarity with each other. Critically, NATO can maintain and sustain its forces.

And about those troop numbers: The 32 NATO nations together have about 3,368,000 active-duty personnel, and each NATO nation has its own reserve forces, along with some paramilitary formations. This is deterrence in the flesh.

**NATO Around the World**

The alliance is addressing more than just threats from Russia. NATO has reached out to nations such as Australia, New Zealand and Japan as it watches moves by China in the Asia-Pacific, as well as in Africa and, increasingly, the Arctic. NATO has a program to work with Mediterranean nations. The alliance is addressing cyber threats and the moral use of artificial intelligence.

The Cold War wasn't won by political parties, but by all Americans and all citizens of NATO countries. The unity of the alliance was important to ending the Cold War, but so was American leadership and will, as U.S. presidents from Bill Clinton to George W. Bush to Joe Biden said.

The alliance has had widespread U.S. support since its founding in 1949. But there are calls for isolationism — of America going it alone. In an interconnected world, this isn't possible.

The only time NATO invoked Article 5 of the Washington Treaty was when terrorists attacked the U.S. on Sept. 11, 2001. NATO personnel fought and died alongside American forces in Afghanistan.

Secretary Austin has noted that America's greatest asymmetric advantage over any competitor is its network of allies and partners. NATO is the jewel in the crown.

"Our allies magnify our strength and expand our security," Austin said in Brussels. "America's network of allies and partners worldwide — built and sustained by wise administrations of both parties in the decades since the nightmare of World War II — remains a core strategic strength that no rival can match — and that none should doubt."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image in the claim (<image:55>) shows ships participating in the BALTOPS 24 exercise in the Baltic Sea in June 2024, not en route to the Lebanon coast in August 2024. The evidence from the image search indicates that U.S. warships were in the region in August 2024, but the specific image in the claim is unrelated to the events described.

The claim is therefore false.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

Content: The Tehran Times reports that Ismail Haniyeh used WhatsApp just before the assassination. <image:7378>


# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The Tehran Times reports that Ismail Haniyeh used WhatsApp just before the assassination. However, the evidence does not mention Israeli intelligence tracking Haniyeh through WhatsApp.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified. The evidence confirms Haniyeh's WhatsApp usage before the assassination but lacks information about Israeli intelligence involvement.

_________________________



JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The new evidence confirms the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, as reported by Al Jazeera, WHYY.org, and Politico. However, none of these sources mention Israeli intelligence tracking Haniyeh through WhatsApp.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified due to the lack of evidence supporting the involvement of Israeli intelligence and the use of WhatsApp for tracking.

# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated, and he used WhatsApp before the assassination. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that Israeli intelligence tracked him through WhatsApp.

The claim is not fully supported by the available evidence, as it lacks information about Israeli intelligence tracking Haniyeh via WhatsApp. Therefore, the claim is considered unverified. `not enough information`

# Instructions
You are provided with the record of a fact-check. It contains the Claim to be verified and a documentation of all the fact-checking work along the gathered evidence. Your task is to **summarize the fact-check**. That is, you provide a concise, one-paragraph justification for the final VERDICT based on the knowledge from the Record. Note:
* Be truthful, brief, do not add any additional information besides the information given in the Record. 
* Link key sources in your summary. Use Markdown notation for that. You may link them in-line.
* Don't state the Claim again. Rather focus on the key insights of the fact-check.
* Simply print just the summary.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "For the assassination on July 31, 2024, Israeli intelligence tracked Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh through WhatsApp."

## Actions
```
image_search("Ismail Haniyeh WhatsApp")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/502689/Ismail-Haniyeh-used-WhatsApp-just-before-assassination-son-says): 
Content: The Tehran Times reports that Ismail Haniyeh used WhatsApp just before the assassination. <image:7378>


## Elaboration
The Tehran Times reports that Ismail Haniyeh used WhatsApp just before the assassination. However, the evidence does not mention Israeli intelligence tracking Haniyeh through WhatsApp.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified. The evidence confirms Haniyeh's WhatsApp usage before the assassination but lacks information about Israeli intelligence involvement.


## Actions
```
image_search("Israeli intelligence Ismail Haniyeh assassination")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/31/hamass-political-chief-ismail-haniyeh-assassinated-in-iran-state-media](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/31/hamass-political-chief-ismail-haniyeh-assassinated-in-iran-state-media)) reports on the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh. <image:7804> WHYY.org ([https://whyy.org/articles/hamas-ismail-haniyeh-assassination-israel-strike-iran/](https://whyy.org/articles/hamas-ismail-haniyeh-assassination-israel-strike-iran/)) discusses the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh. <image:7805> Politico ([https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/30/hamas-leader-ismail-haniyeh-reportedly-assassinated-tehran-00172019](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/30/hamas-leader-ismail-haniyeh-reportedly-assassinated-tehran-00172019)) reports on the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh. <image:7806>


## Elaboration
The new evidence confirms the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, as reported by Al Jazeera, WHYY.org, and Politico. However, none of these sources mention Israeli intelligence tracking Haniyeh through WhatsApp.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified due to the lack of evidence supporting the involvement of Israeli intelligence and the use of WhatsApp for tracking.


## Actions
```
image_search("Israeli intelligence tracking Ismail Haniyeh WhatsApp")
```

## Evidence
No new evidence found.

## Elaboration
The claim cannot be verified. While the evidence confirms Ismail Haniyeh's assassination and his use of WhatsApp, there is no evidence to support the assertion that Israeli intelligence tracked him through WhatsApp.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated and used WhatsApp. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that Israeli intelligence tracked him through WhatsApp. Therefore, the claim is not fully verifiable.

`false`


## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is not fully verifiable. While reports confirm the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh and his use of WhatsApp, there is no evidence from sources like the [Tehran Times](https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/502689/Ismail-Haniyeh-used-WhatsApp-just-before-assassination-son-says), [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/31/hamass-political-chief-ismail-haniyeh-assassinated-in-iran-state-media), [WHYY.org](https://whyy.org/articles/hamas-ismail-haniyeh-assassination-israel-strike-iran/), or [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/30/hamas-leader-ismail-haniyeh-reportedly-assassinated-tehran-00172019) to support the assertion that Israeli intelligence tracked him through WhatsApp.

The first phase of the war, he [writes](https://twitter.com/netanyahu/status/1710796924092129517)
 on X, involves “destroying most of the enemy forces” that have infiltrated into Israel and have killed civilians and soldiers.

Israel has also begun an offensive into Gaza “and it will continue without hesitation and without respite – until the goals are achieved.”

“We will restore security to the citizens of Israel and we will win,” he writes.

A senior Biden administration official says on a call with reporters that the US “will treat Hamas for what they are. They are an international terrorist organization.”

Washington’s focus is currently on “ensuring that the Israelis have what they need to respond appropriately,” says the official.

The White House official says the US is ready “to offer all appropriate means of support to the people and government of Israel.”

“Israel has a right to defend itself and its people. Full stop.”

“We remain deeply aligned,” said the official, adding that Israel’s response is likely to continue “for some time.

The official says that that US will continue to “work with parties throughout the region” to make sure the fighting doesn’t spread from Gaza.

The official also speaks about the potential of a normalization deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia, saying that it is “premature to say the impact” that the war will have on those efforts.

“That process has a ways to travel,” says the official, adding that “terrorist groups like Hamas will not derail any such outcome.”

In a statement to Hamas’s Al-Aqsa TV, the terror group’s military spokesman Abu Ubaida claims that the number of hostages taken into Gaza is “many times greater than what Netanyahu thinks,” and that they are being held in various locations throughout the coastal strip.

Israel is now facing a deep crisis after witnessing the heroism of Hamas militants, Abu Ubaida says, adding that Israeli soldiers fell before them “like locusts.”

He vows that Hamas will continue the ongoing operation on all fronts.

Eleven Nepalese agricultural students have been injured, two of them seriously, in the Hamas attack on southern Israel, according to a statement by the Nepalese Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Nepal’s ambassador to Israel tells CNN that when the attack began, the students were working on a farm in the area. They hid in a bomb shelter but that building was taken over by Hamas.

Separate unconfirmed reports in the Hindustani Times and India Today state that some Nepalese students are also among those who have been taken hostage by Hamas.

The Israel Defenses Forces provides details on a number of airstrikes it carried out in the Gaza Strip in the last few hours.

The IDF says it carried out a drone strike on a rocket launcher, and killed two terrorists standing next to it.

In other drone strikes, a terror cell was hit while attempting to infiltrate into Israel via Zikim beach, and another cell was hit while trying to infiltrate from central Gaza, the IDF says.

Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan speaks with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to urge a halt to the violence in and around Gaza.

A Saudi Foreign Ministry statement says the two discussed “the necessity of working toward an immediate halt to the escalation.”

Prince Faisal emphasizes “the kingdom’s rejection of the targeting of civilians and the need for all sides to respect international humanitarian law.”

The Saudis have been in talks with the White House over potentially forging diplomatic relations with Israel, efforts which have now been thrown into question.

Germany and France move to reinforce security around Jewish temples, schools and monuments after the surprise attack by Hamas against Israel.

Germany tightens police protection of Jewish and Israeli institutions, as some supporters of the Palestinians took to the streets of Berlin to celebrate the attack.

France is focusing on Jewish temples and schools in cities across the country, as one Jewish leader expresses concern at the possibility the conflict might be imported there.

“In Berlin, police protection has been immediately stepped up,” Germany’s Interior Minister Nancy Faeser tells Bild newspaper. “The federal government and the regions are closely coordinating their actions.”

Germany’s authorities are also closely watching “potential supporters of Hamas in the Islamist sphere,” she adds.

In France, security had already been stepped up at synagogues in Paris, Marseille, Lyon and Strasbourg because of the holiday period being observed since late September.

Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin sends an urgent message to prefects running the country’s regions asking them to reinforce surveillance even further.

“At a time when terrorist attacks from Gaza are hitting Israel, I ask you to immediately step up vigilance, security and protection of Jewish community sites in France,” he writes in a message seen by AFP.

He called for a “visible and systematic static presence,” and the use of soldiers from France’s Operation Sentinelle, a special force deployed across the country since the 2015 terror attacks. The interior ministry will review the security situation at a special meeting tomorrow.

#### [Hamas official: Our attack has only just begun](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/hamas-official-our-attack-has-only-just-begun/)

By [Gianluca Pacchiani](https://www.timesofisrael.com/writers/gianluca-pacchiani/ "Gianluca Pacchiani")

Hussam Badran, a member of the political bureau of Hamas, says the terror group’s onslaught is only in its early stages.

Badran says the attack, called the “Al-Aqsa Deluge” by the terror group, comes after careful preparation aimed at catching Israel by surprise.

The terror leader says this battle is different from all previous rounds of conflict, and calls on Arab mediators to convey to Israel that it must “leave our occupied lands.”

He adds that Hamas does not expect them to be mediators but rather supporters of its position.

Like a number of Hamas leaders who have issued statements today, Badran claims the attack is motivated by Israeli control over the flashpoint Al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem.

The mosque, the third holiest site for Muslims, sits atop the Temple Mount, the holiest site for Jews as the location of the biblical temples. Israel has long maintained a delicate status quo at the site, in which Jews are allowed to visit during limited hours, but not pray. Terror groups have repeatedly used baseless claims of Israeli intentions to take over the mosque as a pretext for violence.

Badran also blames Israeli policies in the West Bank and its treatment of Palestinian prisoners for the attack, adding that “we are the owners of this land, and this occupation will not last forever.”

The surprise onslaught against Israel has killed at least 250 Israelis, including many civilians, and injured over 1,000. An unspecified number of Israelis, living and dead, are held hostage by terrorists in Gaza.

By [AFP](https://www.timesofisrael.com/writers/afp/ "AFP")

Irish deputy premier and foreign affairs minister Micheal Martin condemns the attack by Hamas on Israeli citizens, and says it is “vital that the voice of moderation comes to the fore.”

Martin says he could “see tensions rising” during a recent trip to the region, and that the scale of today’s attack is “quite shocking.”

“We believe a two-state solution remains the only sensible and rational solution to this issue and it needs political momentum behind it,” he says.

“My sense is that the hardliners are growing in influence, and that’s why I believe the need to have moderate voices in the center is key,” he says.

“So what we need really is a political peace process to get on track in a serious way. That will mean I think, international intervention as well to facilitate that, but it’s a very, very complex and difficult situation and there will be many consequences to today’s attack.”

Israel’s courts will operate on an emergency footing tomorrow and will only hold hearings on urgent matters due to the Hamas invasion of southern Israel and the war with Gaza, it announces.

A statement put out by the Israel Courts Administration says the decision was made by Justice Minister Yariv Levin “with the knowledge of and \[in accordance with the\] opinion of Supreme Court President Justice Esther Hayut and Director of the Courts Administration Judge Michael Spitzer.”

The decision applies to Israel’s magistrates, district and labor courts, as well as the Supreme Court and the rabbinical courts.

Hearings scheduled for parole committees on Sunday will be postponed to a later date.

The statement condemns “the recent unprovoked and continuous attacks by Israel on Palestinian towns, cities, and refugee camps” as well as “the inhumane siege imposed on the nearly 2 million inhabitants of Gaza,” which the organization says is “an implied declaration of open war on the Palestinians which oblige them to be in constant self-defense.”

The organization calls on the US government “to exert pressure on the occupation regime to immediately cease these atrocities” and criticizes any Arab and Muslim nations that have normalized relations with Israel.

According to the US State Department, Blinken calls “on all leadership in the region to condemn” the Hamas attacks on Israel, and also urges the PA to “enhance steps to restore calm and stability in the West Bank.”

Today in Ramallah, Abbas chaired an emergency leadership meeting of the Palestinian Authority, and according to the official news agency Wafa, “gave instructions to provide protection for the Palestinian people, stressing the right of the Palestinian people to defend themselves against the terrorism of settlers and the occupation forces.”

Abbas also “gave directions to provide all that is necessary to bolster the resilience and steadfastness of the Palestinian people in facing the crimes committed by the Israeli occupation and settler gangs.”

Netanyahu says the army is currently clearing Hamas terrorists from everywhere they infiltrated, going house to house, “restoring control to our hands.”

He sends love and condolences to all the bereaved families that lost loved ones “brutally murdered in cold blood.” He prays for the recovery of the injured.

And he warns Hamas that Israel will hold it responsible for the hostages it has taken. “Israel will avenge anyone who is harmed,” he says, “in so much as a hair on their head.”

He says Israel stands in solidarity with residents of the south, who stood firm and fought bravely.

He praises the security forces, calling them the latest in the long history of Israel’s war heroes.

“You are fighting now for all of our homes, for all of our futures,” he says.

“We are all with you, we all love you, we all salute you.”

He praises the members of the emergency services, and says their spirit will help overcome our enemies.

He says he spoke with President Biden and other world leaders from France, Britain and beyond, thanks Biden for his “unreserved support,” and says he secured international backing for “freedom of action” for Israel.

Netanyahu says all Israelis “are in this together. It will take time. It will be hard. We have challenging days ahead of us.”

But he promises that “with God’s help, with our combined strength, and with our belief in an eternal Israel, we will win.”

In an address to the nation, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vows to use “all the power” of the IDF to destroy Hamas’s capabilities, and tells Gaza’s residents to “get out now.”

Calling today’s events something “never before seen in Israel,” he vows to ensure “it will never happen again.”

He begins by saying Hamas “invaded Israeli territory this morning,” and started a “cruel and evil war,” targeting innocent civilians young and old.

“We will win this war, but the price will be unbearably heavy,” he says.

“Hamas wants to murder us all,” Netanyahu says, “murdering children and mothers in their homes, in their beds.

“It is an enemy that kidnaps elderly people, children, young girls,” an enemy “that massacres and slaughters our civilians, our children, who simply wanted to enjoy the festival.”

“What happened today has never been seen before in Israel and I will ensure it never happens again. The entire government supports this decision. The IDF will immediately use all its power to destroy Hamas’s capabilities,” he says. “We will fight them to the bitter end and avenge this black day they plotted for Israel and its people.”

Israel will target Hamas everywhere — turning the places it “hides and operates” into “cities of ruin.”

He tells the “residents of Gaza” to “get out now because we will operate everywhere and with full force.”

Israeli forces are seen beginning to demolish a police station in Sderot where a number of Hamas terrorists were holed up earlier.

It is unclear how many terrorists are left inside, and how many Israeli forces were killed when Hamas stormed the station this morning.

The death toll from the Hamas terror group’s massive attack on Israel rises to more than 250, Hebrew-language media reports say, citing medical officials.

The toll is expected to continue to rise.

At least 1,450 have been wounded, many seriously.

Dozens of civilians as well as IDF soldiers are believed to have been abducted and brought into Gaza; the IDF has confirmed that soldiers and civilians have been taken hostage, but has not specified a number.

Thousands of rockets have been fired at the south and center of the country, killing a number of people.

US President Joe Biden backs Israel’s right to self defense, warns other parties in the region against joining the attack against the Jewish state, and says he is in contact with leaders around the region.

“Today the people of Israel are under attack orchestrated by a terrorist organization, Hamas. In this moment of tragedy, I want to say to them and to the world and to terrorists everywhere, the United States stands with Israel. We will not ever fail to have their back, we’ll make sure that they’ll have the help their citizens need and they can continue to defend themselves,” Biden says in a broadcast, while flanked by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken.

“The world has seen appalling images of thousands of rockets in a space of hours raining down on Israeli cities… Hamas terrorists crossing into Israel, killing not only Israeli soldiers but Israeli civilians in the streets, in their homes, innocent people murdered, wounded, entire families taken hostage by Hamas, just days after Israel marked the holiest of days on the Jewish calendar. It’s unconscionable.”

“Israel has the right to defend itself and its people, full stop. There’s never justification for terrorist attacks and my administration’s support for Israel’s security is rock solid and unwavering.”

“This is not a moment for any party hostile to Israel to exploit these attacks to seek advantage. The world is watching.”

“It’s also a terrible tragedy on a human level, hurting innocent people, seeing the lives that have been broken by this, the families torn apart. It’s heartbreaking.”

Biden says he has spoken to the king of Jordan and members of Congress, and told his national security team to engage with their Israeli counterparts for military, diplomatic and intelligence cooperation to “make sure Israel has what it needs.”

Biden has directed his team to be in constant contact with leaders around the region, including in Saudi Arabia, the Palestinian Authority, Turkey, Egypt, Qatar, Oman, the UAE and Europe.

He says he will remain in close contact with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whom he spoke to earlier today.

“Let there be no mistake, the United States stands with the State of Israel,” Biden says.

Magen David Adom names the senior paramedic and ambulance driver who was killed this morning as Aharon Haimov.

He died after being shot in an MDA ambulance by Palestinian terrorists as he was on his way to treat victims in his hometown of Ofakim as the coordinated attack on Israel by Hamas from Gaza unfolded.

Haimov was a 25-year-old married father of two. He also leaves behind parents, siblings and an extended family.

Haimov began his career with MDA as a post-high school volunteer. He later joined the organization in a professional capacity as an emergency medicine paramedic and ambulance driver.

In a statement, MDA says that Haimov always performed his duties in an exemplary way and was the first to respond to emergency events.

“He was a person who put the good of others and the value of life ahead of everything else — including today, on this tragic morning,” says MDA director-general Eli Bin.

Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has decided to extend an emergency situation to the entire State of Israel, his office says.

Earlier, Gallant declared the “special situation” within a range of 80 kilometers from the Gaza Strip.

The “special situation” allows the military’s Home Front Command to restrict gatherings and close off areas.

#### [UN’s Palestinian rights official condemns both sides after surprise terror attack](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/uns-palestinian-rights-official-condemns-both-sides-after-surprise-terror-attack/)

By [Luke Tress](https://www.timesofisrael.com/writers/luke-tress/ "Luke Tress")

The UN Human Rights Council official tasked with investigating the Israeli-Palestinian conflict refrains from condemning Palestinian terrorists after they launch a devastating surprise attack on Israeli civilians and soldiers.

UN special rapporteur for the Palestinians Francesca Albanese says, “I unequivocally condemn attacks on civilians. Whoever launches them.”

“Today’s violence must be put into context. Almost six decades of hostile military rule over an entire civilian population… are in themselves an aggression,” Albanese says. Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005.

Albanese has a history of antisemitism and tends to place sole blame for the conflict on Israel, which she views as a “colonial” entity.

The US, Israel and other authorities have demanded her removal due to her bias, but the UN has not taken any action against her.

Martin Griffiths, UN under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, also hedges in his condemnation of terror.

“I am extremely alarmed by the rapidly escalating events in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory. The number of civilian casualties on both sides is reportedly already in the hundreds,” he says. “Violence is never the answer. I appeal to all sides to stop the fighting immediately and protect civilians everywhere and at all times.”

The UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker Türk, condemns the terror attacks.

“I am shocked and appalled at reports this morning that hundreds, possibly thousands, of indiscriminate rockets have been fired by Palestinian armed groups towards Israel, and that at least 22 Israelis have been killed and hundreds injured,” Türk says.

More recent figures indicate at least 200 Israelis have been killed, over 1,400 wounded, and others taken hostage.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and Tor Wennesland, the UN’s special coordinator for the Middle East peace process, both issue condemnations of the terror attacks.

Hersh Goldberg-Polin, 23, hasn’t been heard from since 8:11 a.m. this morning, when he sent two messages to his parents: “I love you” and “I’m sorry.”

At the time, Goldberg-Polin’s parents, Jon Polin and Rachel Goldberg, didn’t understand the cryptic meaning of the message.

They’d last seen Hersh at 11 p.m. the previous night, after he attended Simhat Torah holiday services with them at their local Jerusalem synagogue and then joined them for dinner with family friends.

“He had a backpack and left at around 11 to join his friend,” said Polin, who didn’t know anything specific about his son’s plans.

The family is religiously observant and doesn’t usually use phones on Shabbat, but after Polin came home early from synagogue Saturday morning, the two reached out to a good friend of their son’s who confirmed that Goldberg-Polin was at an all-night “nature party” near Kibbutz Re’im.

The community is close to the Gaza Strip, in an area where Hamas terrorists attacked civilians, including at the party.

Within several hours, photos of handwritten lists began circulating on social media with the names of party attendees and the locations where some had escaped to, Polin says.

“One list said Yishuv Saad, and his name was on that list, and then it was on the Ofakim list,” Polin says. “But he wasn’t at any of those places.”

Friends were at the couple’s home all day, calling and checking with people they knew in each location, but Goldberg-Polin and his friend haven’t been found anywhere. They called hospitals in the south, including Soroka and Barzilay, without any success.

The Jerusalem police are involved, Polin says, and are taking responsibility for reporting the two missing young men to all police units. Pictures of Polin-Goldberg and his friend are also being circulated on social media.

“They think there’s still a bunch of people hiding in the area,” Polin says, adding that the mother of his son’s friend is inclined to drive down south to look for them, but he advises against it, having heard that roads are closed. “Every time we hear information, we turn over everything we can to find out anything. There’s very little we can actually do.”

The Israel Defense Forces says it struck another two high-rise towers in the Gaza Strip, used by Hamas.

The “Palestine” building was used by a number of Hamas units, including intelligence, weapon production, and offices of senior members, the IDF says.

Another office building served as the headquarters of Hamas’s general security, the IDF says.

Earlier today, the IDF hit two other multistory buildings in the Gaza Strip that the military says housed Hamas assets.

In an interview with Al Jazeera, Saleh al-Arouri, deputy head of the political bureau of Hamas, calls the terror group’s onslaught against Israel an “open battle” aimed at achieving the liberation of the Palestinian people and their holy places, following the perceived “desecration” of the Temple Mount in Jerusalem — known as the Al-Aqsa compound to Muslims — by Jewish worshipers over the holiday of Sukkot.

Al-Arouri alleges plans by Israel to impose an unspecified “new reality” at the flashpoint site after the holiday. Hamas has repeatedly accused Israel of seeking to alter the sensitive status quo at the holy site as a pretext for violence.

Al-Arouri adds that Palestinian detainees in Israeli jails are “about to be freed,” anticipating the liberation of security prisoners in exchange for dozens of Israeli hostages the group has reportedly taken, including both civilians and soldiers.

Al-Arouri says some of the Israeli hostages are “senior officers.” He falsely says Hamas does not kill or harm civilians, claiming that there are videos showing how the terror group treats civilians “humanely.” Hamas terrorists slaughtered civilians in southern Israel today, took others captive, and fired hundreds of rockets at civilian population centers.

“We have a plan for all stages of this conflict,” al-Arouri says, “both in case of an Israeli request for a ceasefire, and in case of a continuing escalation of the violence. We are prepared for all options.” He adds that an Israeli ground invasion would be the “best scenario” for Hamas.

Al-Arouri also expresses his “hope and trust” that Palestinians outside Gaza will join the fight “to defend Al-Aqsa,” especially terror groups in the West Bank. Al-Arouri is considered the de facto leader of Hamas in the West Bank.

“We entered this battle not just for a few hours. We entered it knowing that there will be consequences, and we have no choice but to fight it to achieve our high goals,” he says.

He adds that Hamas is in communication with international and regional parties, and implies that it has received offers for mediation. He also accuses the US of providing financial and military aid to Ukraine but neglecting Palestinians.

Al-Arouri touches on the possible participation of Hezbollah in the attack on Israel, saying Israel is right to fear violence on the Lebanese front in the north, claiming that Israel occupies part of Lebanon’s territory.

Yair Lapid (L), Benny Gantz (C) and Benjamin Netanyahu (R) (Flash90)

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu proposes that opposition parties Yesh Atid and National Unity enter an emergency government following Hamas’s devastating surprise attack Saturday morning.

Netanyahu makes the offer during a meeting with Yesh Atid leader Yair Lapid and National Unity party leader Benny Gantz held earlier today, saying such a government would be the same in format as the Levi Eshkol government then-opposition leader Menachem Begin joined before the Six Day War in 1967.

Gantz says he is considering entering such a government for the duration of the war but insists that government would “deal with security challenges alone” and in a manner that would allow “substantive partnership and influence over decision-making in relevant forums” for his party.

The National Unity party leader tells Netanyahu that regardless, the current government will receive full backing “for any responsible and determined security action.”

Lapid said earlier this evening that he would join “a reduced, professional, emergency government” and says it would be impossible to manage a war with “the extreme and dysfunctional composition of the current cabinet,” essentially calling on the prime minister to remove the far-right Religious Zionism and Otzma Yehudit parties from the government in order for him to bring his Yesh Atid party into the coalition.

The death toll from the Hamas terror group’s massive attack on Israel rises to more than 200, Hebrew-language media reports say.

The toll is expected to rise higher.

At least 1,100 have been wounded, many seriously.

Hundreds of Hamas gunmen infiltrated into Israel this morning, crossing at multiple points and overwhelming what the IDF considered to be the highly sophisticated border fence.

Hamas claims to have abducted dozens of Israelis to Gaza; the IDF has confirmed that soldiers and civilians have been taken hostage, but has not specified a number.

Thousands of rockets have been fired at the south and center of the country, killing a number of people.

In Yavne, a 73-year-old woman was seriously hurt and a 77-year-old man was lightly hurt, MDA says.

In Bat Yam, a 24-year-old man was moderately hurt, MDA says.

In Tel Aviv, four people were wounded, including one in moderate condition, MDA adds.

The victims are being taken to hospitals in the area.

Hamas claimed to have launched 150 rockets from the Gaza Strip at Tel Aviv in the barrage.

A coalition of organizations behind the anti-judicial overhaul protests announce a general aid effort for residents of Israeli communities near the Gaza border, including hosting for citizens fleeing the fighting, transportation services, equipment logistics, assistance from mental health professionals, and more.

“At this difficult hour for our brothers and sisters in the south and the entire Jewish nation, the protest organizations are putting their complete organizational infrastructure and logistical capabilities toward the aid and support of the residents in the line of fire,” the organizations say in a social media notice.

The organizations also call for a freeze on all protest activities until further notice and said that while the “gigantic failure” of the security establishment in regards to the surprise Hamas attack must be addressed, “at this time all efforts must be directed toward aid of the southern residents, IDF soldiers and security forces.”

The White House slams a Republican “disinformation” campaign blaming the Biden administration for today’s Hamas attack on Israel.

Prominent Republican lawmakers as well as former president Donald Trump have claimed the US deal to release hostages from Iran gave Tehran access to funds that it is using to support Hamas.

“Not a single cent from these funds has been spent, and when it is spent, it can only be spent on things like food and medicine for the Iranian people,” says White House National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson.

“These funds have absolutely nothing to do with the horrific attacks today and this is not the time to spread disinformation,” she adds.

Israel’s Ambassador to the UN Gilad Erdan sends a letter to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and Sérgio França Danese, the Brazilian diplomat who holds the Security Council presidency this month, calling on the Security Council to immediately condemn Hamas.

“It is now time for the international community including the Security Council to unequivocally condemn the appalling terror attacks carried out by Hamas and all terrorist organizations against the civilians of Israel,” Erdan writes.

“Israel expects and demands the solidarity and support of all those in the international community who oppose this barbaric terrorism and the targeting of innocent men, women and children for slaughter. It will not tolerate moral equivalence between those defending against this terrorism and those perpetrating it. There can be no option other than zero tolerance for Hamas’ war crimes and genocidal agenda.”

Erdan also places blame on Iran for, in his words, funding and directing Hamas.

“The State of Israel will act in any way necessary to protect its citizens and sovereignty from the ongoing terrorist attacks originating from the Gaza Strip and carried out by Hamas and other terrorist organizations,” he writes. “We will not stand idly by as Israelis are attacked and killed.”

“Secretary Austin has directed his team to ensure that DoD is closely consulting with all of our Allies and partners who share a commitment to peace and oppose terrorism,” the US readout says. “Secretary Austin will continue to consult with Minister Gallant in the coming days and weeks to ensure that Israel has the support it needs.”

The Israel Defense Forces claims to have killed hundreds of Palestinian terrorists in southern Israel and the Gaza Strip in the last few hours.

Among the counter-attacks is a drone strike against two terrorists attempting to breach the security barrier near the disused Karni crossing; nine terrorists killed during clashes with troops in the town of Nirim; and four terrorists targeted by a fighter jet at the Erez Crossing.

Other terror squads were killed by troops in the southern towns of Sufa, Kfar Aza, and Kerem Shalom, the IDF says.

The IDF also carried out several drone strikes against terrorists in the area.

The military publishes footage showing one of the strikes near the southern town of Be’eri.

Four terrorists are still holding two Israelis hostage in an apartment in Ofakim, some 12 miles (20 kilometers) from the Gaza border.

The incident has been playing out all day, since several carloads of terrorists drove into the city, Channel 12 reports.

When rocket alarms sounded, and residents of the city descended into bomb shelters, the gunmen opened fire on them, killing several people. Many terrorists have been killed in the hours since.

Four terrorists went up into an apartment in the city, where two Israelis remained, and they have been holding them hostage ever since.

Security forces have made several attempts to find a way to break in and rescue them, but to no avail thus far.

Magen David Adom’s Shai Kadosh says two people he knows were killed in the city during the day and that he and his colleagues have been treating casualties all day.

In light of the high number of injuries due to the war, the Health Ministry announces that all ambulatory and elective medical services will be canceled on Sunday at hospitals within 80 km of the Gaza border. Well-baby clinics will also be closed within that area.

Some hospitals in the center of the country, including Hadassah in Jerusalem and Meir in Kfar Saba, have also announced that they will only accept patients in need of urgent medical care.

Hospitals throughout the country will continue to provide critical and timely care, such as oncological and hematological treatments, dialysis, in vitro fertilization treatment, and emergency cardiological procedures.

If patients are scheduled for a hospital procedure or clinic visit on Monday, they should double-check with the hospital whether they should come in or not.

The Meuhedet health maintenance organization has asked its members to seek service from their primary physicians via hybrid (online) medicine appointments as much as possible.

All medical system employees have been ordered to cancel plans to travel outside the country, and all medical staff currently outside Israel have been asked to return.

The European Union “condemns in the strongest possible terms” the Hamas attacks on Israel, and stressed Israel’s right to self defense.

“The EU calls for an immediate cessation of these senseless attacks and violence,” says EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell in a statement issued on behalf of all 27 member states, “which will only further increase tensions on the ground and seriously undermine Palestinian people’s aspirations for peace.”

Borrell says the EU “stands in solidarity with Israel which has the right to defend itself in line with international law, in the face of such violent and indiscriminate attacks.”

A man says his wife, two young children and mother-in-law have been taken to Gaza and that he has seen them in a video from the coastal enclave.

Yoni Asher tells Channel 12 news that his wife and children aged three and five were visiting his mother-in-law at Kibbutz Nir Oz near the Gaza border when they were taken during an infiltration by Hamas terrorists.

Earlier this afternoon, he told the outlet that he had not spoken to his family for a number of hours but that he had tracked his wife’s phone to the Gaza Strip.

Asher issued desperate pleas for help in finding his family, speaking to multiple outlets in the hope that he could get the message out.

“I have seen my wife’s phone in \[Gaza city\] Khan Yunis,” he told the Kan public broadcaster. “I contacted the police, the Home Front Command and I don’t know what’s going on. I need your help so that I can contact my wife, my daughters and my mother-in-law.”

Israeli activists in the US launch a crowdfunding campaign to assist residents of southern Israel.

The activists from the anti-overhaul protest movement leverage their network of thousands of Israelis and US Jews in the US to respond to the Palestinian terror onslaught in Israel.

The funds will go to medical, psychological and physical support for the victims, [the campaign](https://www.americaisraeldemocracy.org/southunderattack)
 says.

“We join hands to support the needs of Israelis under attack. This is what we can do from here now,” organizers say. “This is exactly the same solidarity from which we stand in rallies every week.”

All protest activities are suspended.

With some flights to Israel canceled, the activists are also organizing local hosts who can house Israelis who are unable to return home.

Activists from the UnXeptable protest group urge Israelis who are in the US and need assistance to contact them.

An open support gathering will take place at the Jewish Community Center of Manhattan at 76th Street and Amsterdam Ave. between 2-4 p.m. this afternoon.

The Israeli consulate in New York also says it is accepting all offers of help and support.

The Secure Community Network, which coordinates security for Jewish communities in North America, urges vigilance but says there are no known threats to US Jews related to the terror onslaught in Israel.

The group says it is coordinating security measures with law enforcement and other partners.

“SCN recommends Jewish facilities review and enforce security protocols, and maintain coordination with law enforcement,” the group says in a statement.

Police in the New York town of Ramapo, which has a significant Jewish population, increase patrols to “ensure our residents’ safety during this crisis,” town supervisor Michael Specht says.

The Israel Defense Forces says it carried out airstrikes against two high-rise towers in the Gaza Strip that were used to house Hamas assets.

“The Hamas terrorist organization deliberately places its military assets in the heart of the civilian population in the Gaza Strip,” the IDF says.

“Prior to the strike, the IDF provided advance warning to the occupants of the building and asked them to evacuate,” the military adds.

Opposition Leader Yair Lapid calls for an “emergency government” to manage “the difficult and complex operation ahead of us” after more than 100 Israelis have been killed, close to 1,000 wounded and an unknown number of soldiers and civilians abducted by Hamas terrorists into Gaza.

“The State of Israel is at war. It won’t be easy and it won’t be short. It has strategic consequences which we haven’t seen for many years. There is a serious risk that it will become a multi-front war,” Lapid says in an announcement.

“A short while ago, I met with Prime Minister Netanyahu. I told him that in this emergency situation I’m willing to put aside our differences and form an emergency, narrow, professional government with him to manage the difficult and complex operation ahead of us.”

Netanyahu, he says, “knows that with the current extreme and dysfunctional security cabinet, he can’t manage a war. Israel needs to be led by a professional, experienced, and responsible government. I have no doubt that former Defense Minister \[Benny\] Gantz would also join a government like this.”

“Forming an emergency professional government will make clear to our enemies that the vast majority of Israeli citizens stand behind the IDF and security forces. It will make clear to the world, in the international community, that the people of Israel stand united against this threat,” says Lapid.

“The State of Israel suffered a hard blow today. We are all hurting, we are all angry. However, wars and countries aren’t managed with pain and anger but with calm and a strategic understanding of the situation. We need to put politics to one side for the sake of an emergency government that will manage this situation with determination and won’t deal with anything else until we achieve victory over our enemies.”

Lapid made his offer for an emergency government in person to Netanyahu after receiving a security update, says a source close to the opposition leader.

The source says that “the offer is real, this isn’t a political thing. The offer is there.”

Netanyahu has not responded and a source close to Lapid declines to comment if fellow opposition party head, National Unity leader Gantz, was consulted before or after the unity government offer was made.

During the call, which was requested by Secretary Austin, Gallant details recent events in Israel and operations carried out by the IDF and defense establishment, his office says.

Gallant says Israel is currently at war, and has been facing terror attacks against its citizens since this morning – this includes men, women, children and elderly individuals.

“The State of Israel will win this war, and Hamas will be held responsible for its actions,” his office says.

Gallant thanks Austin and the US Administration for their support for Israel.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has condemned Hamas’s surprise attack on southern and central Israel this morning.

“The secretary-general is appalled by reports that civilians have been attacked and abducted from their own homes,” says a statement from his spokesperson.

Guterres “is deeply concerned for the civilian population and urges maximum restraint. Civilians must be respected and protected in accordance with international humanitarian law at all times.”

“The secretary-general urges all diplomatic efforts to avoid a wider conflagration,” the statement continues. “He stresses that violence cannot provide a solution to the conflict, and that only through negotiation leading to a two-state solution can peace be achieved.”

Many of the clips are too gruesome to broadcast.

The Israel Fire and Rescue Services say the head of the Kiryat Gat station, Cpt. Shalom Tzaban, and a senior firefighter from the Netivot station, Yevgeny Galsky, were among those killed in the Hamas terrorist attack on southern Israel today.

By [Amanda Borschel-Dan](https://www.timesofisrael.com/writers/amanda-borschel-dan/ "Amanda Borschel-Dan")

Middle East analyst Avi Issacharoff tells The Times of Israel on Saturday that the unprecedented assault on Israel by land, sea and air is an inadvertent benchmark for the Israel-Hamas relations, as significant as the September 11, 2001 attacks on the US.

“I think that they wanted to kidnap a few people, to negotiate over them, and not to get into the threat of their collapse — of their ending” — that this coordinated attack will inevitably bring, Issacharoff says. “Everyone knows that Gaza will pay a very heavy price.”

Any former policies of cooperation with the Gaza-based terrorist organization are “not even relevant anymore,” he says, and negotiations “under or over the table” will no longer take place.

Asked whether he believes Israel’s northern border will become another front in the current war, he says it is as yet unclear whether Hezbollah is planning a coordinated attack.

“Either they’re going to jump in and be very stupid, or not,” he says.

“Starting another front with Israel may bring more \[Israeli\] casualties… but at the end of the day, we might end up with the end of Hamas and Hezbollah.”

“It’s the 9/11 \[for Israel\], and if this doesn’t go into a major ground operation, it’s the end of this government’s political life,” says Issacharoff.

The Israel Defense Forces’ top spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, confirms the Hamas terror group has taken Israelis as hostages to the Gaza Strip.

In a briefing with reporters, Hagari says Israeli soldiers have also been killed in the fighting.

No numbers are given on the number of hostages or soldiers killed.

Hagari says there are still 22 locations of ongoing fighting in southern Israel, including hostage situations in Be’eri and Ofakim.

He says Israeli troops have reached all towns on the Gaza border, and are working to scan each and every one.

Four divisions are being deployed to the Gaza border, joining 31 battalions that are already there, Hagari says.

Benny Gantz, the leader of the opposition National Unity party, pledges support for the security and emergency forces and says Israel is “completely unified.”

“I want to say clearly, in a way that resonates from Gaza, via Beirut, to Tehran: The entire people of Israel are united,” he says. “All Israel’s citizens stand behind the security forces, and the government has the backing to charge a heavy, painful and effective price in order that an event like this is not repeated.”

“There is no coalition and opposition now,” Gantz adds, “just a single fist that will pound the enemy.”

He says all those involved in this attack are destined to die, and that any other terror groups that decide to take part “will be making a terrible mistake.”

“It must be honestly said: the results of this attack are grave. Soon, some of the rumors will be confirmed as bad and painful news for us all. I send my condolences to the families of the fallen… and pray for the recovery of all the injured.”

He hails the bravery of civilians, the emergency services and soldiers. “Israel can be taken by surprise, but it cannot be beaten, as we will prove this time as well,” Gantz says.

“Sadly, American taxpayer dollars helped fund these attacks, which many reports are saying came from the Biden Administration,” he says, ostensibly blaming US policy on Iran for today’s attacks.

“The soldiers opened fire toward the terrorists and thwarted dozens of them, as well as two rubber boats and two additional vessels,” the IDF adds.

The death toll from the Hamas terror group’s attack on Israel rises to more than 100, Hebrew-language media cite medical officials as saying.

The number is seen as certain to rise further.

Some 800 people have been wounded in the attacks, which have included hundreds of Hamas terrorists infiltrating into Israel and gunning down soldiers and civilians. Others were wounded in rocket attacks.

Ra’am’s Mansour Abbas urges Arab Israelis not to respond to rumors or incitement

Abbas, leader of the Islamist Ra’am party, is the first Arab Israeli political leader to publish a statement reacting to the ongoing deadly Hamas assault on Israel.

The party leader writes in Hebrew: “In light of the sad, tragic events since this morning, and the situation assessments saying that the situation may devolve into a regional war, I call on Arab citizens of Israel and on all citizens, Arabs and Jews alike, to exert restraint and behave responsibly and patiently, to obey the law and maintain public order.”

“I urge \[Arab Israeli citizens\] to restrain from any type of violence or damage to public or private property, and not respond to rumors or incitement aimed at causing an escalation inside or outside Arab towns, or in mixed cities.”

Abbas further calls for unity and mutual support and to give hospitality to families fleeing the areas under attack, particularly in the Negev and in unrecognized villages, many of which are not equipped with anti-rocket shelters.

Ella, a resident of Kibbutz Be’eri, tells Channel 12 that she is in a safe room at her home in the kibbutz and is hearing “lots of gunfire” nearby.

She speaks amid unconfirmed reports that Hamas gunmen are holding hostages at the kibbutz dining hall.

Meanwhile, another resident of the south says his wife and daughters have disappeared, and that he has traced his wife’s phone — which doesn’t answer — to Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip. He says he fears his family has been kidnapped to Gaza.

Hamas claims to have kidnapped dozens of Israeli civilians and soldiers to Gaza.

These reports are not officially confirmed by Israel. Channel 12 news reports, however, that Hamas has kidnapped men and women, young and old, civilians and soldiers to the Gaza Strip. The infiltration is proving “far more successful” from Hamas’s perspective than it would have expected, the TV station’s Ohad Hemo says, and Hamas almost certainly doesn’t know itself how many Israelis it has kidnapped.

In turn, though, Hemo says, the Israeli response in Gaza is likely to be much more far-reaching than Hamas would have expected.

A senior adviser to Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei expresses support for an attack Hamas launched against Israel, calling it a “proud operation.”

“We support the proud operation of Al-Aqsa Flood,” Yahya Rahim Safavi says at a meeting held in support of Palestinian children in Tehran, quoted by ISNA news agency.

“We support this operation, and we are sure that the resistance front also supports this issue,” says Safavi, who is a senior general in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.

Safavi expressed backing for the Palestinian terrorists “until the liberation of Palestine and Jerusalem.”

Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman Nasser Kanani also hailed the Palestinian terror assault on Israel.

“Today’s operation marked a new page in the field of resistance and armed operations against the occupiers,” he says.

“The resistance has so far achieved brilliant victories during this operation, and this is a bright spot in the history of the Palestinian people’s struggle against the Zionists.”

At a parliament session on Saturday, Iranian lawmakers chanted “Down with Israel,” “Down with America,” and “Welcome Palestine,” according to a video published by Tasnim news agency.

Iran, which hosted leaders of Hamas and Islamic Jihad in June, considers Israel its arch-enemy.

“Our commitment to Israel’s right to defend itself remains unwavering, and I extend my condolences to the families of those who lost their lives in this abhorrent attack on civilians,” Austin says in a statement.

Over nine hours since the Hamas terror group launched a deadly assault on Israel with terrorists infiltrating from land, air and sea, there are still gunmen in a number of Israeli communities.

In addition, there is still near-continuous rocket fire — while the center of the country was targeted by projectiles earlier in the day, the fire is now mainly toward southern towns.

By [Gianluca Pacchiani](https://www.timesofisrael.com/writers/gianluca-pacchiani/ "Gianluca Pacchiani")

Saudi Arabia calls for an “immediate halt to the escalation between the two sides, the protection of civilians, and restraint” amid the ongoing assault by the Hamas terror group.

Riyadh says it ‘repeatedly warned’ of an explosive situation with Palestinians.

In a statement, the Kingdom recalls its “repeated warnings of the danger of the explosion of the situation, as a result of the continued occupation, the deprivation of the Palestinian people of their legitimate rights, and the repetition of systematic provocations against its sanctities.”

The Saudi Foreign Ministry further calls on the international community to lead a “credible peace process” to achieve a two-state solution.

The kingdom has been conducting negotiations to achieve a normalization deal with Israel. According to recent leaks, the Saudi negotiators, while insisting on concessions for the Palestinians, do not see the creation of a Palestinian state as a precondition for a possible deal.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US President Joe Biden are expected to speak in the next hour amid a massive and deadly attack by the Hamas terror group on Israel.

President Isaac Herzog calls for the international community to unite in its condemnation of Hamas after the Gaza-based terror group launched a deadly attack.

“Today we saw the true face of Hamas. A terrorist army whose only goal is the cold-blooded murder of innocent men, women, and children. Supported and directed by their proxy commanders in Iran, they carried out an unprovoked, heinous attack against the Jewish state on a Jewish holy day. Innocent civilians were massacred and wounded, and many are still under attack,” Herzog says in a statement.

“The State of Israel will take all measures necessary to eliminate this clear and immediate danger to our citizens. Israel will overcome in the face of all challenges,” he says.

“I call upon the family of nations – this war waged against us marks a line in the sand. Now is the time to hear clear, unequivocal condemnation of Hamas, its allies, and its backers in Iran. Now is the time to stand firm with Israel in support of its just and moral battle in the face of an abhorrent enemy,” he says.

Palestinian media outlets report 160 killed and over 1,000 wounded recorded by hospitals in the Gaza Strip since this morning.

The toll likely includes those targeted by the Israeli military in airstrikes, and during clashes with troops in southern Israel.

Shoval Kahlon, a resident of Sderot, describes the situation in the border town which was infiltrated by Hamas terrorists.

“There are Hamas troops walking around. We see videos of them. They’re walking round with impunity,” she tells the Kan public broadcaster from the bomb shelter of her home.

Security forces are fighting terrorists in at least four areas in the town, the broadcaster reports.

“We woke up at 6:30 a.m. to alarms, we thought it was the usual rocket attacks but we started hearing gunshots on the street, sounded like it came from the parking of our building. Then we realized something was unusual. We then started seeing Hamas people in pickup trucks. They knocked on the homes of residents, who thought they were Israeli soldiers. They took them hostage,” says Kahlon.

The United States “unequivocally condemns the unprovoked attacks by Hamas terrorists against Israeli civilians,” says White House National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson.

“There is never any justification for terrorism. We stand firmly with the government and people of Israel and extend our condolences for the Israeli lives lost in these attacks,” Watson says.

US “National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan has spoken to Israeli National Security Advisor Tzachi Hanegbi and we remain in close contact with our Israeli partners,” Watson adds.

A baby has been found at Kibbutz Kfar Aza near the Gaza border, and the parents are nowhere to be seen, Channel 12’s Tamir Steinman reports.

The baby is alive. Kibbutz residents are pleading for anyone who has information on the baby’s family to come forward.

The kibbutz is one of several places where Hamas gunmen are still believed to be on the loose.

Steinman, speaking a few minutes later, also says several of his friends and contacts who live in areas close to the Gaza border, including some he was talking to earlier today, “are no longer answering… and it’s clear why they’re not answering.”

The UN’s Middle East envoy Tor Wennesland “vehemently condemns” today’s multi-front Hamas assault of Israeli towns near Gaza and the firing of rockets into central Israel.

“These events have resulted in horrific scenes of violence and many Israeli fatalities and injuries, with many believed to be kidnapped inside the Strip. These are heinous attacks targeting civilians and must stop immediately,” Wennesland says in a statement.

“I am deeply concerned for the well-being of all civilians. I am in close contact with all concerned to urge maximum restraint and call on all sides to protect civilians.”

“This is a dangerous precipice and I appeal to all to pull back from the brink,” he adds.

The mayor of Sderot, Alon Davidi, says his city is still under attack.

“Don’t open the doors, stay inside, close the windows… we’re still searching the area,” he tells local residents via Channel 12.

He says the Hamas leadership, from Ismael Haniyeh on down, are “animals” who “must be harmed and killed.”

The people of Israel “haven’t yet seen” what’s happened in the city, he says — “inhuman acts” against innocent people. The terrorists have to be “wiped out,” he says.

Israel has given Gazans food, water and electricity, and allowed Gazans into work, he notes, but the Gaza Hamas leadership are “murderers who must be buried under the ground. Not because we are cruel, but because those who are merciful to the cruel, ultimately are cruel to the good.”

“People still don’t understand the numbers” and the extent of the attacks, he says.

A Channel 12 reporter in the city says there are many “bodies on the ground… terribly grave pictures, scenes that are hard to describe.”

These fatalities, the reporter stresses, are victims of gunfire by Hamas terrorists who infiltrated from Gaza into the city, not rocket attacks.

At least 40 people have been killed and over 700 injured since the start of the massive attack by the Hamas terror group, the Magen David Adom emergency service says.

The Health Ministry says 779 people have been hospitalized.

Terror cells from the Gaza group have infiltrated a number of communities in the south of the country.

In addition, thousands of rockets have been fired at the center and south.

Hamas has claimed to have taken a number of hostages from Israel to the Gaza Strip. There has been no confirmation from Israel.

The assault has been ongoing since approximately 6:30 a.m.

The death toll is expected to rise.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu makes a statement at the start of the security cabinet meeting, calling for all the citizens of the country to unite.

“Since this morning, the State of Israel has been at war. Our first goal is first of all to cleanse the area of the enemy forces that have infiltrated, and restore security and peace to the settlements that were attacked,” Netanyahu says.

“The second goal, at the same time, is to exact a huge price from the enemy, also in the Gaza Strip,” he says.

“The third goal is to fortify other arenas so that no one makes the mistake of joining this war,” Netanyahu says.

“We are at war, in war, you have to keep calm. I call on all citizens of Israel to unite in order to achieve our highest goal – victory in the war,” the premier says.

The official name for the campaign by the Israel Defense Forces amid the devastating Hamas attack is Operation Swords of Iron.

Ukraine’s President writes a long post condemning the devastating Hamas terror assault on Israel and says that all its details should be revealed to the world.

Here is the post in full:

“Horrible news from Israel. My condolences go out to everyone who lost relatives or close ones in the terrorist attack. We have faith that order will be restored and terrorists will be defeated.

“Terror should have no place in the world, because it is always a crime, not just against a specific country or this terror’s victims, but against humanity in general and our entire world.

“Anyone who resorts to terror commits a crime against the world. Whoever finances terror is committing a crime against the world. The world must stand united and in solidarity so that terror does not attempt to break or subjugate life anywhere and at any moment.

“Israel’s right to self-defense is unquestionable.

“All details surrounding this terrorist assault must be revealed so that the world knows and holds accountable everyone who supported and helped carry out the attack.

“All Ukrainian citizens who remain in the risk zone must carefully obey all orders issued by local security services and remain vigilant. Please be cautious. The Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and our embassy in Israel are ready to assist in any situation.

“To support Ukrainians in Israel, we established an operational headquarters. If you require assistance, please contact any of our diplomatic or consular offices in any convenient and accessible manner.

Every life is valuable! We condemn all forms of terrorism.”

Channel 12 broadcasts footage from earlier this morning apparently showing a bulldozer breaking through the border fence between Israel and the Gaza Strip.

Dozens of terrorists from the Hamas terrorist group infiltrated into Israel by land, air and sea, going on deadly rampages through border communities.

The Hamas terror group has published footage showing its members capturing a number of Israeli soldiers during an attack on a military base on the border with the Gaza Strip this morning.

Other clips circulated online have purported to show Israeli civilians taken hostage by the terror group.

The IDF has yet to comment on the allegations.

EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell calls for the immediate release of Israeli hostages who were kidnapped and taken to Gaza amid a massive assault by the Hamas terror group.

“News of civilians taken as hostages in their homes or to Gaza are appalling,” Borrell writes on X, the social media site formerly known as Twitter.

“This is against international law,” he writes. “Hostages must be released immediately.”

The Hamas terror group has published footage showing its members capturing a number of Israeli soldiers during an attack on a military base on the border with the Gaza Strip this morning.

Other clips circulated online have purported to show Israeli civilians taken hostage by the terror group.

The IDF has yet to comment on the allegations.

European leaders roundly condemn the massive assault by the Hamas terror group on Israel.

German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock says Hamas contributes to “the intensification of violence,” adding Israel “has our full solidarity” and “the right, guaranteed by international law, to defend itself against terrorism.”

France expresses “full solidarity with Israel and the victims” and underscored “its absolute rejection of terrorism and its commitment to Israel’s security.” French President Emmanuel Macron said he “firmly condemns” the attacks.

Italy also backed “Israel’s right to defend itself” against the “brutal attack.”

Britain’s foreign minister James Cleverly condemns the “horrific attacks” and underlined Israel’s right to self-defense.

Dutch PM Mark Rutte says: “Appalling images from Israel. Terror organization Hamas is waging an unprecedented attack on Israel… This violence must stop; Israel has every right to defend itself.”

Spain says it is “shocked by the indiscriminate violence” of the attacks on Israel while Ukraine and the Czech Republic say they back Israel’s right to defend itself.

The European Union “unequivocally” condemns attacks by the Palestinian group Hamas on Israel and called for an immediate stop to the violence.

The comments came after a barrage of rockets was fired and fighters from the Palestinian enclave infiltrated Israel, a major escalation in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

EU chief Ursula von der Leyen says she “unequivocally” condemns the “terrorist attack by Hamas on Israel,” adding that it was “terrorism in its most contemptible form.”

“Israel has the right to defend itself against such odious attack,” she adds.

“This horrific violence must stop immediately. Terrorism and violence solve nothing. The EU expresses its solidarity with Israel in these difficult moments,” EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell says.

European Council president Charles Michel also condemns the “indiscriminate attacks launched against Israel and its people this morning inflicting terror and violence against innocent citizens.”

“My thoughts are with all the victims. EU stands in solidarity with Israeli people in this horrific moment.”

The Israel Defense Forces announces it is canceling schools in central and southern Israel, meaning roughly 1 million children will stay home tomorrow, amid ongoing fighting between Israel and terror groups in the Gaza Strip.

All schools south of Netanya and north of the central Negev are to be closed and businesses can only be opened if there is ready access to bomb shelters, the military says.

Gatherings are also restricted to 10 people outdoors and 50 people indoors in those areas, the IDF Home Front Command says.

The restrictions are valid till Sunday at 6 p.m., but will likely be extended further amid the fighting.

Hezbollah praises the massive Hamas operation against Israel, and says it is message to Arab countries normalizing with Israel.

The terror group Hezbollah says it is in direct contact with the Hamas leadership in Gaza and abroad, and calls on Arab and Muslim peoples around the world to declare their support to Hamas and the Palestinian people, adding that armed resistance is the only way to confront the Israeli “aggression.”

Hezbollah adds that the “Al-Aqsa Deluge” operation launched by Hamas against Israel is a message to the international community and the Arab and Muslim world, in particular those countries seeking normalization with Israel.

It also calls on the Israeli government to learn the “important lessons” taught by the “Palestinian resistance.”

“Citizens of Israel, we are at war,” he says. “And we will win.”

“The enemy will pay a price like they have never known before,” he says, in his first public statement on the matter, some five hours since the start of the assault by the Gaza-based terror group.

Israeli residents near the Gaza Strip continue to ask for help and report on shooting by terrorists inside the towns while there is little or no IDF presence on the streets.

A pregnant Kibbutz Sufa resident speaks to Channel 12 from a safe room with her two-year-old child and close family members, saying: “They are shooting at our house, they are trying to break down the door of the safe room.”

She reports that her husband and four other armed residents are fighting in the streets with no aid from the military.

“I don’t understand how this is still going on. We’re in this situation since 6 a.m.,” she says. “Four people cannot fight them off alone

“Send help, please,” she cries.

Residents in other areas near the Gaza Strip report of unprecedented fighting on all major Israeli media sources. In an Instagram story timed to 9:55 a.m. cited by Ynet, a resident of Kfar Gaza writes: “I’m begging you!!! We can’t catch anyone! There are terrorists in Kfar Gaza, send forces to Kibbutz Kfar Gaza!!!”

A Channel 12 reporter in Beersheba describes receiving dozens of requests for help from residents of the Gaza Strip.

Mirjam Reijnen, a 42-year-old volunteer firefighter in Nahal Oz, tells AP: “With rockets we somehow feel safer, knowing that we have the Iron Dome (missile defense system) and our safe rooms. But knowing that terrorists are walking around communities is a different kind of fear,” she said, adding that she and her three kids have been too scared to leave the shelter even for a moment to use the bathroom.

Hamas says it has launched 5,000 rockets at Israel in an early morning surprise attack it calls “Operation Al-Aqsa Flood.”

Mohammad Deif, the Hamas military commander, issues a statement saying that the ongoing attacks are in retaliation for Israel’s “desecration” of the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem.

He adds that Israel killed and wounded hundreds of Palestinians this year, and that Israel rejected offers for prisoner exchange deals.

Over 5,000 missiles were fired, Deif claims.

“Today, the people are bringing back the revolution and reviving the March of Return,” he says.

He urges Arabs in Jerusalem and inside Israel, in the Negev, the Galilee and northern Israel “set the earth on fire under the feet of the occupiers.”

He further calls on the “Islamic resistance in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Lebanon” — countries with terror movements that are militarily supported by Iran — to “merge their resistance with that of the Palestinians today,” and “start marching towards Palestine now.”

Hamas military commander Muhammad Deif (courtesy)

Mohammad Deif, the Hamas military commander, issues a statement calling the morning’s attacks and infiltration “the day of the great revolution.”

He urges Israeli Arabs to take up arms, and encourages Arabs on Israel’s borders to join in the attack.

“Today, the people are bringing back the revolution and reviving the March of return,” he says. He urges Arabs in Jerusalem and inside Israel, in the Negev, the Galilee and the Triangle area to “set the earth on fire under the feet of the occupiers.”

He further calls on the “Islamic resistance in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Lebanon” – countries with terror movements that are militarily supported by Iran – to “merge their resistance with that of the Palestinians today,” and and “start marching towards Palestine now.”

Saleh al-Arouri, deputy head of Hamas who is considered to be its leader in the West Bank, issued a statement along the same lines, calling on the Arab and Islamic nation to join the battle “Flood al-Aqsa.”

The video has been shared by Ryan Rozbiani @RyanRozbiani with the caption: “Hezbollah has claimed responsibility for the missile attack, stating the target was the headquarters of Israel’s Unit 8200 in Tel Aviv. Activating air defenses in Tel Aviv to try to confront a heavy missile barrage from Hezbollah. Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv has halted all air traffic due to the missile launches.”

In a statement, the Iran-backed group said it had fired missiles at the Nirit area in the Israeli capital. In a Telegram post, the Lebanese group said they carried out the recent attack in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza and in support of protecting the Lebanese people. Hezbollah’s statement came after a video verified by Al Jazeera’s Sanad agency.

According to a Reuters report, sirens sounded all around Tel Aviv during the airstrike. No casualties have been reported in the attack so far. Citing Israeli media reports, Al Jazeera reported that all air traffic at Ben Gurion airport was suspended after Hezbollah carried out airstrikes and the Israeli military declared a state of emergency in the Tel Aviv region.

The Israeli military confirmed that Hezbollah fired at least 20 rockets toward Tel Aviv.

Hezbollah and Israel have been engaged in a fierce military conflict since the Palestinian militant group Hamas launched a massive attack on Israel on October 7, 2023.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image search results provide conflicting information. One result shows a man holding a framed photo, while another shows Mayar Hamida and Bilal Hamida. The claim states that Mayar and Bilal Hamida were killed by Israel. However, the evidence does not confirm the claim.

The evidence does not provide information about the circumstances of their deaths or the involvement of Israel.

To verify the claim, additional information is needed, such as reports from reliable sources confirming the deaths of Mayar and Bilal Hamida, the cause of their deaths, and the involvement of Israel.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

The Human Rights Watch report "Why They Died: Civilian Casualties in Lebanon During the 2006 War" contains an image of a man holding a framed photo (<image:7828>). The search result from palinfo.com contains an image of Mayar Hamida and Bilal Hamida (<image:7829>).


## Elaboration

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
