Useful result: From [Source](https://euromedmonitor.org/en/article/6176/Statistics-on-the-Israeli-attack-on-the-Gaza-Strip-%2807-October---23-February-2024%29): 
Content: The Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor provides statistics on the Israeli attack on the Gaza Strip from October 7 to February 23, 2024.

The claim 'The population in Gaza has increased by 2.02% since Oct. 7, 2023.' is false.
Justification: The claim is **false**. Multiple sources, including a BBC article ([https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-20415675](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-20415675)) and the Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor, indicate significant displacement of the population since October 7, 2023, suggesting a decrease rather than an increase in population. The OCHA map also shows a population of 750K in October 2023 and 2.1 million in November 2024.

So, the overall veracity is: false
