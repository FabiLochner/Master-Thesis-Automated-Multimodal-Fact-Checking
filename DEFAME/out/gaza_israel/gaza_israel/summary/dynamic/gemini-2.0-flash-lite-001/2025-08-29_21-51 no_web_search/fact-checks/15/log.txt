Useful result: From [Source](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/montreal-traffic-signs-pro-palestinian-slogans-1.7274809): Found exact image on website with title: Montreal electronic traffic signs altered to display pro-Palestinian ...
Content: The CBC News article, published on July 25, 2024, reports that electronic traffic signs in Montreal were altered to display pro-Palestinian slogans, including "Free Palestine" and "Escalate now." <image:13> The signs, which are owned by a private contractor hired by the city, were hacked to display the messages. A group called Clash Mtl claimed responsibility. The Montreal police are investigating the incident, which the City of Montreal called an act of vandalism. The original messages were restored by the end of the morning. The article includes a photograph of one of the altered signs.

The claim '<image:13> This image shows a traffic sign in Montreal in July 2024 which displays a 'Free Palestine. Escalate now' message and was authorized by Montreal's Mayor Valérie Plante.' is false.
Justification: The image depicts a traffic sign in Montreal displaying a "Free Palestine" message, which was confirmed by image and reverse image searches. However, the sign was hacked, and the City of Montreal considered it an act of vandalism, contradicting the claim that the message was authorized by Montreal's Mayor Valérie Plante, as reported by [CBC News](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/montreal-traffic-signs-pro-palestinian-slogans-1.7274809).

So, the overall veracity is: false
