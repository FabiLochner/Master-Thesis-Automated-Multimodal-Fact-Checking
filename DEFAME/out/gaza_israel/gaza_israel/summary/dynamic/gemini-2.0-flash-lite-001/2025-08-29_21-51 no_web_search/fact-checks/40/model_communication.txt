# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that Robert Burke was expelled from Columbia University in 1936. The search results and the New York Times article mention his expulsion. The evidence also suggests that the expulsion was related to anti-Nazi protests.

However, the exact month of the expulsion is not explicitly stated in the provided evidence. Therefore, the claim that the expulsion occurred in June 1936 cannot be fully verified.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

Greta Thunberg was seen with a placard that read "Stand with Gaza"

**New Delhi:**

Climate activist Greta Thunberg's support for Gaza has drawn a sharp response from Israel. On Friday, Greta posted a picture on X, formerly Twitter, in which four activists, including herself, held placards expressing solidarity with Palestine and Gaza.

Reacting to Ms Thunberg's post, Israel, through its official X handle, took a dig at the climate activist saying that Hamas doesn't use sustainable materials for their rockets, "which have butchered innocent Israelis".

"The victims of the Hamas massacre could have been your friends. Speak up,” the post added

Israel also used pictures of three 19-year-old Israelis, who were killed allegedly in a Hamas attack.

The response came after Ms Thunberg, in her post, was seen with a placard that read, "Stand with Gaza."

Another activist called for a "Free Palestine," while two other women held placards with messages, "This Jew supports Palestine" and "Climate justice now!"

“Week 270. Today we strike in solidarity with Palestine and Gaza. The world needs to speak up and call for an immediate ceasefire, justice and freedom for Palestinians and all civilians affected,” Greta Thunberg wrote in the caption.

Some users, however, came to Ms Thunberg's defense. They pointed out that her expression of support was for Gaza, not necessarily for Hamas. One user wrote, “Your subconscious and true ideals leaked. She said Gaza, not Hamas. This says a lot. good luck editing this next.”

Another person accused Israel of “playing the victim card.”

A user accused Israel of similar actions and brought up concerns about the environmental sustainability of the air and watercraft used by the IDF in the context of restricting movement and impacting Palestinians in the region. “The air and watercrafts used by the IDF to restrict movement and BUTCHER innocent Palestinians in the largest open-air prison for 75 years aren't made of sustainable materials,” read the comment.

Ms Thunberg's statement came 270 weeks after she initiated her Friday school strike, which later ignited the global school strikes movement.

The United Nations revealed that in just 10 days, around 4,200 people have lost their lives and more than a million people have been forced to leave their homes due to the Israel-Hamas war.

Greta Thunberg — from climate warrior to Israel hater
=====================================================

Thunberg's stance on the Middle East conflict sparks division within the global climate movement, as many activists question its relevance to environmental advocacy

Greta Thunberg brought millions out onto the world’s streets to protest for a greener future. Demonstrating against companies polluting the planet in a variety of countries, she was arrested multiple times. Since Hamas’ brutal October 7 terrorist attack, the Swedish activist has redirected much of her rage toward Israel.

She wears a keffiyeh, poses with Palestinian flags and accuses Israel of "genocide," while largely ignoring Qatar, which, for years, has been transferring to Hamas funds derived from its oil and natural gas sales profits. Paradoxically, burning these fuels emits greenhouse gases, a contributing factor to global warming - the very issue Thunberg has been protesting for years.

At demonstrations, she calls to "Free Palestine," stop arming Israel and impose a permanent ceasefire on the country. She rarely, if ever, demands the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza or condemns the terrorist attack that triggered the war.

Demonstrating against Israel being her first priority, Thunberg didn’t even bother attending either the 2023 climate conference held in Dubai or that of 2024 in Baku, Azerbaijan. The climate activist has turned her back on her supporters, and alongside her relentless anti-Israel campaigning, has also sparked anger in other arenas.

Thunberg visited Turkey’s Kurdish regions last November, evoking outrage in the country for condemning Erdogan’s government. She criticized the environmental destruction in Kurdish-populated areas. "Destruction and exploitation of nature – such as unlawful forest cutdowns, sacrificing zones for mining companies and fires – is one of the many tools used as part of the continuous attacks against the Kurds. This often leads to devastation of local communities and biodiversity as well as forced displacement."

On an X posting, she then called on Turkey to amend its treatment of the Kurds. "Turkey must clarify its stance on the Kurds and other minority groups by enshrining their rights in the constitution." She went on to write, "The government continues to use ‘terrorism’ as a pretext to silence its political opponents. Tens of thousands of politically active individuals remain imprisoned without fair trials. International organizations such as the ECHR, UN, and Amnesty have condemned this and called for their release. For a sustainable peace and a just future, the Kurds’ right to freedom and autonomy must be respected and the violent attacks against Kurdistan must end."

After causing ire in Turkey, she moved on to voice her support for independence for Western Sahara, provoking fury in Morocco. She posed with the Western Sahara flag, championing the region’s struggle for justice and human rights. She said it was unacceptable for the international community to ignore the situation in Western Sahara and called for global action toward a just resolution.

This too is a political struggle, in no way related to climate issues. She’s also condemned the Azerbaijani government, accusing it of "ethnic cleansing" and further crimes against Armenians, and has protested against Georgia’s government, advocating "Justice, freedom and democracy," amid the country’s political crisis.

And if you’d thought Thunberg had given up on her anti-Israel activism, you’d be wrong. She continues posting images of Palestinian flags and protest signs in support of Gazans from her weekly demonstrations in Stockholm. Last month, she returned to Denmark, where she took part in a violent protest against the Maersk shipping company.

Along with further anti-Israel activists, Thunberg disrupted activity at the company’s headquarters, claiming it was using its ships to transport weapons to Israel. She called on the company to cancel all contracts and investments related to what she termed "Genocide and occupation of Palestine." Thunberg was arrested along with around two dozen more protesters who were all released shortly thereafter.

Meanwhile, she regularly shares anti-Israel messages urging her 14 million Instagram followers, and millions more on other social media platforms, to demonstrate and take action against Israel.

Thunberg is the daughter of actor Svante Thunberg and opera singer Malena Ernman who represented Sweden in Eurovision 2009. At age 15, in the summer of 2018, Greta started a one-woman protest outside the Swedish parliament. She would show up every Friday with a small sign reading, "Skolstrejk för klimatet" (School Strike for Climate) She was slowly but surely joined by more teenagers and, in time, mobilized masses worldwide to take to the streets to protest the climate crisis. She met with numerous world leaders and took part in demonstrations across the globe.

Her protest peaked the following September with millions of young people flooding the streets of major cities worldwide and staging climate marches. Thunberg led hundreds of thousands in a climate demonstration in New York City, making the journey to America by solar-powered boat, averting the greenhouse gas emissions of a transatlantic flight.

That same month, Thunberg even expressed solidarity with Israel, tweeting a photo of climate supporters in Tel Aviv - only to be met with backlash. Despite talk backers angrily asking, "How dare you?”, she left up the posting.

Greta Thunberg on the cover of Time Magazine

Thunberg was named Time Magazine's 2019 Person of the Year. Then - and current - US President Donald Trump, whom Thunberg had stared down at the UN building in New York, mocked her, tweeting, "Greta must work on her Anger Management problem, then go to a good old-fashioned movie with a friend! Chill Greta, Chill!"

Thunberg has even received several Nobel Peace Prize nominations for her climate activism. The committee went for other candidates.

Israeli social media users also expressed their indignation, arguing that her statements essentially amounted to support for Hamas. One user, "@hasolidit," remarked: "Autistic children were murdered by Hamas and singled out as legitimate military targets solely because they were Israeli Jews. Your failure to even acknowledge that is proof of your rabid antisemitism. Not your stupid stuffed animal," referring to a toy octopus appearing in one of Thunberg’s posts, interpreted by some as an antisemitic symbol.

Thunberg didn’t stop at anti-Israel posts, but rather brought her anti-Israel activism to her weekly protests outside the Swedish parliament. Three weeks following the massacre, the Swedish activist stood alongside anti-Israel placards declaring, "Free Palestine," and, "Stop the Holocaust," and she herself held a sign reading, "Justice for Palestine."

> Many argue that Thunberg’s political stance is damaging the crucial fight against climate change

Criticism of Thunberg has also emerged on the global stage with Fridays for Future (FFF) leaders in Germany, Austria, and even in her homeland of Sweden, distancing themselves from her October 20 post featuring signs supporting the Palestinians, while ignoring the Hamas massacre. Israeli teens have also lashed out at Thunberg, turning her from a role model to a resented figure.

Thunberg’s controversial stance has meant the global climate movement, which had enjoyed widespread consensus support, has found itself divided around a conflict many of its advocates don’t understand, and certainly has nothing to do with environmentalism.

Thunberg has become fixated on the Palestinian issue. At rallies, rather than talking about global warming, the climate crisis, pollution killing millions every year, or countries (such as Iran, Iraq, and Qatar) still producing oil, she has repeatedly spoken out against Israel.

At a rally in Amsterdam November 2023, a man approached her on stage and said that he had come to an environmental, not political, event. The man was forcibly removed from the stage as Thunberg declared to the crowd, "No climate justice on occupied land."

Palestinian flags were waved in the crowd and Thunberg was spotted donning a keffiyeh. In an effort to clarify her stance, she said, “As a climate justice movement, we have to listen to the voices of those who are being oppressed and those who are fighting for freedom and for justice. Otherwise, there can be no climate justice without international solidarity.” She, again, in no way addressed the Hamas terrorist attack that sparked the war. Why? Maybe, it was convenient for her to overlook the murderous attack so as to stand alongside Gazan civilians, some of whom, as it turns out, assisted the terrorists, hiding hostages in their homes or concealing weapons and terrorists.

Amsterdam wasn’t the end of it. Thunberg continued her scathing anti-Israel rhetoric, undoubtedly to the delight of Tehran, Doha, and Hamas leaders in hiding. At a pro-Palestinian in Stockholm in November 2023, she called to "Crush Zionism."

Throughout this time, she carried on wearing a keffiyeh around her neck, posing with anti-Israel protest signs and Palestinian flags and accusing Israel of "genocide" in Gaza. In Malmo, Sweden, last May, she showed up at the Eurovision Song Contest, an event officially defined as non-political. Here, she took part in a protest and was arrested for disturbing the peace. Photos from the scene showed her, with a keffiyeh wrapped around her neck, being dragged away by two police officers. At this demonstration, Palestinian flags were waved and slogans were chanted against Israel and then President Joe Biden. She was arrested once more a few months later, this time in Copenhagen, again at an anti-Israel rally,

Many argue that Thunberg’s political stance is damaging the crucial fight against climate change. The young woman who once drew millions globally against corporations polluting the environment and fought for a better future has now abandoned the cause she spearheaded. Her role has shifted from that of a leader enjoying global consensus to a divisive figure, ignoring the crimes of Hamas terrorists who raped, murdered and kidnapped Israelis on October 7.

The past 18 months have witnessed almost no large-scale demonstrations against climate change, but rather modest protests numbering in the dozens or hundreds. Trump is back in the White House and, unlike during his previous term of office, when climate activists under Thunberg’s leadership were taking to the streets en masse, the U.S. president’s anti-environment measures are passing rather quietly as world leaders are acting slowly if at all. And it looks like no one can lead the global climate protest like the old Greta Thunberg could.

Greta stands with Gaza
======================

![](data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%201%201'%2F%3E)

Greta Thunberg's 'stand with Gaza' is a historic moment for the global climate movement.

> .

Greta Thunberg posted the picture below on her X account during a week of climate and peace protests in London recently. Many people in the press criticised her because they themselves supported the Israeli bombing and opposed a ceasefire. 

_Medical Aid for Palestinians is responding to the current emergency in Gaza. It has launched an emergency appeal to 'ensure that Palestinian health workers have the medical resources they need, as soon as possible'. You can donate to the appeal_ [_online_](https://www.map.org.uk/donate/donation-details/484)
_._ 

Some of those people called her, ludicrously, antisemitic, because a toy octopus appeared in the first image she used. There was also criticism from some climate activists in Germany, Austria and Israel. Beyond that, there was little open criticism from the climate movement, and much support on social media.

This is a historic moment for the global climate movement. This article explains why. The photo reminded us of Martin Luther King’s speech on the Vietnam War at the Riverside Church in Manhattan on 4 April 1967. 

**Questions**

King had maintained a public silence on the war for the two years after President Johnson sent 500,000 troops to Vietnam. Now he broke that silence to call for peace and American withdrawal.

_Nancy and Jonathan have recently published_ Why Men? A Global History of Violence and Inequality _(Hurst, 2023)._ [_Order a copy now_](https://www.hurstpublishers.com/book/why-men/)
_._

Many of his advisers, and many liberals had urged him not to speak out, saying that it would split the civil rights movement and turn President Johnson’s government against them.

King went ahead. In an eloquent and closely argued speech, he said that he had been urging nonviolence on young African Americans rioters. They had replied to him with a question: What about Vietnam?  

"Their questions hit home, and I knew that I could never again raise my voice against the violence of the oppressed in the ghettos without having first spoken clearly to the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today—my own government.

"For the sake of those boys, for the sake of this government, for the sake of the hundreds of thousands trembling under our violence, I cannot be silent."

**Greatest**

King’s courage strengthened opposition to the war, particularly among Black Americans, and especially among Black American soldiers. But the effect of his words went far wider as well.

King also told the truth – the war was racist. And it was the same racism that characterised American society. And by telling the truth King saved his own integrity.

Greta's speaking style is very different from King’s. He was the greatest rhetorical speaker in America in the twentieth century. He reached for the strongest effects, for metaphors and the rolling rhythms of Southern preachers and gospel music.

Greta is a master of plain speech. Her longest speeches are short, clear and passionate. Her X posts are compact, honest, devastating. And in this picture there are only twelve words. But together they carry a complex argument.

![](/sites/default/files/inline-images/greta-gaza-2%20%281%29_0.jpg)

Each face tells a story, and each tells a different story.

**Radical**

Look again at the four young women. Greta holds a sign that says “Stand With Gaza”. Because she is instantly recognizable, the most important leader in the climate movement, this carries a message: The whole climate movement should support Palestine. 

It’s a call for change. And she is choosing her words carefully: Stand With Gaza. Not peace, not ceasefire - though she supports both. 

But no, solidarity is the starting point. Behind her another young woman holds two words: ‘Climate Justice Now’. She is saying this is about climate. And this is about justice. 

As with King, we cannot talk about climate justice if we do not support the most important issue of social justice in the world right now. A third woman holds two words: “Free Palestine”.

They are written on a piece of paper, or cardboard, on which someone has painted the colours of the Palestinian flag. Again, that means peace, but far more. This is an intervention on the radical side of the issue.

**Moral**

The fourth woman has five words: “This Jew Stands With Palestine.” Our solidarity is not antisemitism. Take a moment to look at those expressions again.

This picture, these four women, are a response to a moral imperative. This is a response to a unfolding great atrocity. That is the most important matter here, and that is enough. But this solidarity is also historically important for the climate movement. Here is why.

This is a change. All through the days of the mass school strikes, Greta insisted that the movement had to be non-political. For example, she refused to support a Green New Deal because it would split the movement. She did not then comment on matters beyond climate.

This made sense to her, as it made sense to many people in the climate movement. And on some level, she may still have hoped against hope for action by the politicians. Then two things happened. 

First, in October 2019 Thunberg called for adults to join the school students on strike. She said that if they did not, the students could not win. Large numbers of trade unionists did strike in Germany and Australia, but nowhere else.

**Conclusion**

The conclusion was clear. Greater power was needed. Only a global movement for social justice in all its forms could deliver that. The other conclusion was that the leaders of the world would not act. Form the UN climate talks in Glasgow in 2021 she sent two tweets that condensed the argument. 

One was “Blah, blah, blah. F\*\*\* you.” The other was “Uproot the system”. Gaza matters because of seventy-five years of suffering, and because human beings, children, women and men are dying there in great numbers.

But those are not the only reasons why so many people have marched in solidarity in so many countries. This is also a great public racist massacre. This is the racism of centuries of white supremacy made murderous flesh again.

People know this, all over the world. It is why African Americans and people of colour are so central to the marches in the United States, and why all the thirteen representatives in the US Congress who have called for a ceasefire are people of colour.

Most people in Africa, Asia and Latin America know this too. But so do many, many white people in Europe and North America. So do people in the Middle East, acutely, in their guts, enraged and in sorrow. And so, as we have seen, do many Jewish people in New York, Washington and Tel Aviv.

**Future**

This is why the movement has been so enormous. We want to rid the world of racism and we are saying every human matters. The scale of these movements has frightened the governments of the world. That is why the secretary general of the United Nations and most of the governments of the world have called for a ceasefire.

This is where the future of Palestine, the future of the climate movement and the future of humanity come together. For one thing, climate change will bring us many massacres like Gaza's, many punishments of refugee camps. 

Runaway climate change will cover the world with walls, camps, barbed wire, hungry refugees and government massacres. The fight against such a future starts now. But there’s more. Pakistan has at least housed many refugees for decades. 

Almost all of Europe is far worse, and there hatred of refugees fuels racism and a turn to the far right. But also, we know by now that we cannot stop climate change without a massive, committed climate movement across the world, willing to take power to save us all.  

We cannot do that without the active support of the majority of workers and peasants in Africa, Latin America and Asia. There are many reasons. The people in the poorer countries of the Global South are 80 per cent of humanity. 

**Horror**

Back in 2019 those countries already produced 62 per cent of global fossil fuel emissions. Soon enough they will produce two-thirds. That means we cannot stop climate change unless the people in those countries insist upon an economy that brings them a decent standard of living through renewable energy.

Moreover, the great social movements of the last hundred century strongest, and most important in the countries of the Global South. After all, that is where people have suffered most. 

And since the Arab Spring, and all the great movements against dictatorship, the social movements have again been strongest in the South. And the impact, the horror, of climate change will be worst in the South. 

The movements in Europe and North America still matter. We write this in England, and Thunberg made that photo in Sweden. And people in the South will not stop climate change if the North refuses to do so. 

**Turning**

We are all in this together. But what happens in the South will matter more. That is why standing with Gaza against racism matters for the future of the climate movement. But there is another link. To stand with Gaza is to stand with life against death. 

To stand against climate change is to do the same on a far larger scale. This photo, just a photo, is a moment in human history. By contrast, Gaza is the most important issue in the world right now. 

But this is also a turning point in the climate movement. There will be many more horrors. We are embarked on the mother of all struggles to save each other and all living things. 

There will be many more such moments, and some of them will be even worse. But the direction of change for the climate movement is becoming clear. Like the signs say: stand with Gaza - climate justice now!.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image of Greta Thunberg holding the sign is authentic. The Ecologist published the image on November 3, 2023, and The Telegraph published a video of Greta Thunberg saying "f--- Israel" at a demonstration. The Guardian also published an article about Greta Thunberg joining an aid ship sailing to Gaza.

The claim states the image is from November 2024, but the evidence suggests the image was published in November 2023. Therefore, the claim is partially inaccurate.

_________________________



JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

## Claim
Claim: "<image:29> This is an authentic image of Greta Thunberg from November 2024 holding a sign reading, 'Fuck Israel'."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:29>)
image_search("Greta Thunberg sign Fuck Israel")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image of Greta Thunberg holding a sign that says "FUCK ISRAEL" (<image:29>) has been found on multiple websites. NDTV.com published an article discussing Greta Thunberg's support for Gaza, but the image in the article is different. Ynetnews published an article titled "Greta Thunberg — from climate warrior to Israel hater" discussing Thunberg's shift towards anti-Israel activism. The Ecologist published an article titled "Greta stands with Gaza" on November 3, 2023, which includes the image of Thunberg holding the sign.

### Evidence from `image_search`
The Telegraph published a video of Greta Thunberg saying "f--- Israel" at a demonstration (<image:7666>). The Guardian published an article about Greta Thunberg joining an aid ship sailing to Gaza (<image:7667>).

## Elaboration
The image of Greta Thunberg holding the sign is authentic. The Ecologist published the image on November 3, 2023, and The Telegraph published a video of Greta Thunberg saying "f--- Israel" at a demonstration. The Guardian also published an article about Greta Thunberg joining an aid ship sailing to Gaza.

The claim states the image is from November 2024, but the evidence suggests the image was published in November 2023. Therefore, the claim is partially inaccurate.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image is authentic, but the claim about the date is inaccurate. The image was published in November 2023, not November 2024. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate. `false`

The attacks on Tuesday and Wednesday, September 17 and 18, in Lebanon with exploding walkie-talkies and [pagers](/en/exploding-hezbollah-pagers-how-did-it-happen/a-70250960)
 apparently targeted members of [Hezbollah](/en/hezbollah/t-41508807)
. The Iran-backed political party and militant group holds Israel responsible for the [strikes that killed at least 29 persons and injured around 2,800 people](/en/lebanon-explosions-stoke-fear-of-hezbollah-retaliation/a-70261978)
.

In the aftermath of the explosions a lot of fake images, videos and claims have been spreading online claiming to show the incidents.

DW's [fact checking team](/en/fact-check/t-56584214)
 checked three viral claims.

Are iPhones exploding in Lebanon as well?
-----------------------------------------

**Claim:** "An iPhone was also blown up in Lebanon", [a social media user wrote on X](https://archive.ph/yYA3i "External link — a social media user wrote on X")
 (formerly Twitter) sharing an image of a destroyed iPhone with more than 800.000 views.

**DW Fact check:** False.

This image of a destroyed iphone is not related to the current attacks in LebanonImage: X

A reverse image search reveals that this image is old and has nothing to do with the current incidents in Lebanon. The image of the exploded iPhone dates back [to March 2021](https://www.cairo24.com/1166674 "External link — to March 2021")
 when Egyptian news outlet Cairo24 reported an iPhone explosion in Maadi, Cairo. The incident caused a fire and injured a child.

Did exploding solar panels hurt more than 500 individuals?
----------------------------------------------------------

**Claim:** Other social media users insinuated that Israel had caused solar panels to burst into flames. "Lebanon: Sabotaged solar panels have started significant electrical fires. Over 500 individuals have been reported injured so far", [this user wrote](https://archive.ph/rkYv2 "External link — this user wrote")
 featuring an Israeli flag. Attached was an image of burning solar panels and a house on fire.

**DW Fact check:** False.

This claim about burning solar panels in Lebanon is false as wellImage: X

There are no documented cases of exploding solar panels in the current attacks in Lebanon. The image is a collage of two old pictures.

[Via a reverse image search](https://archive.ph/kp26N "External link — Via a reverse image search")
we find both images: [The image on the left](https://perma.cc/6TAZ-EPZ9 "External link — The image on the left")
, showing burning solar panels, dating back to[an X-post](https://x.com/FSRI_org/status/1215631166226817024 "External link — an X-post")
 from February 2020. In the post, the US-American Fire Safety Research Institute shared an article about the safety of photovoltaic systems along with the image.

The second photo shows a burning house [dates back to December 2020](https://www.saobserver.net/news/update-westside-home-fire-a-total-loss-not-suspicious-3723448 "External link — dates back to December 2020")
. The fire incident took place in Canada and not in Lebanon.

Did this laptop explode on September 19 in Lebanon?
---------------------------------------------------

**Claim:** "19-09-2024 – Explosion in Laptops”, a social media user wrote on X [posting a photo of a charred laptop](https://archive.ph/5axnH "External link — posting a photo of a charred laptop")
.

**DW Fact check:** False.

This image of a charred laptop does not have anything to do with the current explosions in LebanonImage: X

The user added "Mossad is unstoppable” blaming the Israeli secret service for the explosions of pagers, walkie-talkies and now laptops as well. So far, there is no evidence that Israel or Mossad is responsible for the attacks. Pagers and walkie-talkies indeed exploded killing and injuring people. But no reliable reports exist that laptops did, as well.

The shared image gives no evidence for something alike either. [A reverse image search](https://archive.ph/5H4Cy "External link — A reverse image search")
 shows that the image dates back to [at least 2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/lcljyb/just_got_my_hands_on_an_engineering_sample_3090/?rdt=64930 "External link — at least 2021")
 when it was posted on Reddit.

So far, only pagers and walkie-talkies exploded in Lebanon according to both regional and international news. While Hezbollah and Iran both hold Israel accountable for the explosions it's not confirmed who is responsible for the attacks.

If you want to know more about how the explosions in Lebanon happened technically, DW Science explains it [in this article](/en/exploding-hezbollah-pagers-how-did-it-happen/a-70250960)

[!Not just pagers: iPhones, laptops, electronic locks and other devices exploded in Lebanon today <image:343>](https://itc.ua/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/photo_2024-09-18_18-09-13.jpg)

On Wednesday, September 18, reports of a second wave of explosions began to come in from Lebanon, mostly from Beirut. Today, iPhones and other electronics were exploded.

As of 21:00, the Lebanese Ministry of Health reported 14 dead and 450 injured in the new wave of explosions. Later, the media reported at least 500 injured. Among them are several children and health workers. The attack again predominantly targeted members of «Hezbollah».

[https://itc.ua/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG\_7420.mp4](https://itc.ua/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_7420.mp4)

The video shows many explosions in the city.

In addition to the streets and public places, electrical appliances explode in apartments, houses and shops (about 60 cases), as well as cars (at least 15 cases). Among other things, funeral processions of «Hezbollah» officials killed in yesterday’s explosions were hit by the explosions.

[https://itc.ua/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/video\_2024-09-18\_17-50-16.mp4](https://itc.ua/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/video_2024-09-18_17-50-16.mp4)

An explosion during a funeral.

Among the explosive devices, the media name Apple iPhones and other smartphones, laptops, scooters and mopeds, walkie-talkies, solar panels, and even electronic locks and kitchen appliances. Many sources claim that this includes any device that has a battery.

Hezbollah also exploded stationary and mobile communication stations «Hezbollah» in buildings and cars. The organization called on its members to get rid of electronics altogether. In crowded places, representatives of «Hezbollah» ordered everyone present to turn off their electronic devices.

There is currently no accurate information on whether the series of explosions in Lebanon has ended. Various sources reported two waves of explosions during the afternoon.

Israel’s Pager Attack Has Cooked More Than Just iPhone Sales in China
=====================================================================

![cs_opinion_img](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%2075%2020'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

The pager attack in Lebanon has triggered a trust crisis among Chinese consumers of Western-made electronic products, such as iPhone. In the view of Chinese strategist, Prof. Wang Xiangsui, this once again proves that Western-led economic globalization is only a stage in history, not the final destination.

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201%201'%3E%3C/svg%3E)The pager explosions have taken about 12 lives and injured around 3000 people on September 17  

Last week, the pager attack in Lebanon captured global attention. This form of attack not only triggered panic among the Lebanese people but also shook global confidence in economic globalization. This is because Israel has opened Pandora’s box of using civilian product supply chains for military objectives.

The remote-controlled explosions in Lebanon came in two waves. In the first wave, the devices targeted were primarily pagers used by Hezbollah members. According to The Washington Post and other Western media, the explosives were pre-installed in the batteries. But in the second wave, the explosions extended to everyday civilian items like mobile phones, laptops, cars, and even electric razors used in barbershops. Chinese media outlet Guancha reported that this is done by mixing batteries with remote-controlled detonators into ordinary batteries in the Lebanon market, which were then randomly installed into these devices during repairs.

This is almost akin to randomly poisoning a city’s water supply, resulting in widespread, uncontrollable collateral damage. At least 32 people, including two children, were killed and thousands more injured. In fact, it aligns closely with the United Nations General Assembly’s definition of terrorism, reaffirmed since 1994: “criminal acts intended to cause public fear.”

In the realm of global economics, this type of terrorism is causing an alarming effect on a conceptual level.

For example, on Twitter(X), a photo of an iPhone detonated in Lebanon has sparked widespread attention. And on Chinese social media Weibo, Phoenix News created a vote, asking related to trending news, do you believe iPhones’ batteries have security issues? — with 45.6% of 8121 respondents voting “yes.”

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201%201'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201%201'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

This incident has triggered a direct trust crisis among Chinese consumers toward Western electronic products. Three days after the pager attack, the iPhone 16 was launched in mainland China. Normally, consumers would have to queue at stores to get the latest iPhone, often paying scalpers extra. But this year, the iPhone was already being sold at a discount on e-commerce platforms.

On the other hand, Huawei saw a surge in support. This is because, in the Lebanese explosions, manufacturers from Taiwan island and Japan were unaware that their products had been converted into bombs, claiming that external agents or suppliers had tampered with them. Chinese consumers, recalling that U.S. sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction have prevented Huawei from sourcing parts from Western manufacturers, noted that Huawei has increased the localization of its supply chain. Many Chinese commentators argue that U.S. sanctions have, ironically, “de-risked” Huawei phones.

The term “de-risking” was originally popularized by Western media during Trump’s trade war with China. But as Israel’s actions escalate, it seems Western media have lost control of their narrative. After all, when the West imposed long-arm jurisdiction on Chinese smartphones, electric vehicles, and 5G suppliers, it claimed that its safety standards were high and its detection methods sophisticated. These claims only hold water if consumers believe in them, making such jurisdiction legitimate in democratic societies. Now, however, Israel’s covert actions have undermined that legitimacy. If Western countries and Taiwan authorities cannot prove that they can protect their supply chain from the Mossad, they will lose their authority to define “safety standards” in China and around the world.

This, in turn, offers a significant advantage to Chinese companies. Going forward, Huawei and other manufacturers will no longer need to promote compliance with EU or U.S. standards to endorse product quality. Instead, labels like “Produced according to Chinese standards” or “Entirely non-Western suppliers” could become new selling points. This signals a potential shift in consumer value judgments from a unipolar world dominated by Western standards to a multipolar world where “Chinese standards” compete in parallel. This could reshape the direction of economic globalization, introducing new dimensions and market entry rules.

In the past, China made extensive adjustments to its economic policies and production standards to meet the requirements of the World Trade Organization (WTO), particularly in food safety. However, during incidents like the Fukushima nuclear wastewater discharge and the COVID-19 pandemic, China’s technical standards for inspecting seafood and meat products were notably higher than those of Western countries. With global consumer health in mind, this raises the question: Is China now better positioned to set international food hygiene standards? And in other sectors where China has similarly higher standards, shouldn’t they also be adopted by the WTO?

Clearly, if Western countries are genuinely committed to promoting the cross-border flow of production factors—allowing each country to capitalize on its strengths within the global market—then when it comes to ensuring supply chain security and setting safety standards for certain products, China evidently has a comparative advantage, to lead a higher quality economic globalization.

If the global market is truly free, then perhaps it’s time to move beyond a globalization dominated by Western-developed countries and shift toward a multipolar globalization that better reflects the comparative advantages of all nations.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that iPhones can explode. However, the provided evidence does not support the claim that the image shows an iPhone that exploded during pager attacks on Hezbollah devices in Lebanon in September 2024, blowing up random people. The search results show other instances of exploded iPhones, but none of them are related to the claim.

To verify the claim, I would need information about the specific incident, including the date, location, and cause of the explosion.

Gaza explosions rattle central Israel; scientist explains why
=============================================================

Locals reported hearing loud blasts Friday night, likely stemming from IDF strikes in Gaza, over 40 miles away; why do sounds of blasts from Gaza reach central Israel, how does weather play a role and why are they louder at night? Here’s the explanation

Residents of central Israel, including the Gush Dan and Shephelah regions, reported hearing loud explosions Friday night and early Saturday. The IDF confirmed no rocket impacts in the area while police attributed the sounds to explosions originating in Gaza, more than 40 miles away.

Dr. Yuval Rosenberg, a physicist at the Davidson Institute of Science Education, explained to Ynet that atmospheric conditions can affect how sound travels, amplifying or diminishing its intensity. “When the air near the ground is warmer due to the sun heating the surface, sound waves are refracted upward into the sky. This can reduce the noise we hear,” he explained.

However, during nighttime, when the ground cools faster than the air above it, sound waves bend back toward the ground. “This phenomenon is why explosions from Gaza often sound louder in central Israel at night than during the day,” Dr. Rosenberg added.

The unique interaction of weather and sound physics highlights why certain noises travel farther or seem more pronounced depending on the time of day and environmental conditions.

In addition to explosions heard from Gaza, powerful booms have echoed through the Gush Dan region during the war, caused by rockets detonating over the sea. These loud blasts have sparked anxiety among residents due to their intensity.

“There are many factors that can influence the volume of an explosion we hear, meaning identical rockets detonating can sound vastly different,” explained Dr. Yuval Rosenberg. “The sound waves we perceive are essentially small disturbances in air pressure, which our brain interprets as sound after they reach our ears and vibrate the eardrum and the rest of our auditory system.”

“When a rocket explodes, it creates a shockwave characterized by a sudden and significant change in air pressure,” explained Dr. Rosenberg. “At close range, this shockwave can be extremely dangerous, capable of destroying buildings or killing marine life if the detonation occurs at sea.

"As it travels, the shockwave loses energy as it interacts with and is absorbed by objects, creating destruction but also heating the air. Eventually, as it continues over long distances, the shockwave dissipates and transforms into the sound waves we hear. Simply put, a shockwave is like a massive ocean swell that breaks into smaller waves.”

Dr. Rosenberg highlighted the difference in how explosion sounds carry over land versus sea. “For us to clearly hear the explosion, a significant amount of sound waves must reach our ears, or more precisely, the sound wave intensity must remain strong. However, various factors can block sound waves from reaching us. For instance, shockwaves and sound waves can be absorbed by the ground, trees and buildings. Hard surfaces like hills or building walls can also reflect sound waves, preventing them from reaching us,” he said.

“This is why when a rocket explodes on land, there are many obstacles that diminish the volume of the noise we hear. In contrast, over the sea, there are few such barriers, allowing sound waves to travel more freely and reach us more effectively,” he added.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:35>

### Evidence from `image_search`
Al Jazeera published an article on October 21, 2024, about the US seeking an end to the war in Lebanon, which includes an image of an explosion over a city (<image:7679>). CNN also published an article about the Israel-Gaza-Lebanon war (<image:7680>).

The provided sources do not contain information about the specific image in the claim (<image:35>).


# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence does not confirm the claim. While the image search results mention an Israeli attack on Lebanon on October 21, 2024, and the existence of related articles, they do not provide any information about the specific image in the claim. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available information.

To verify the claim, I would need to find a source that identifies the image and confirms that it depicts an Israeli attack on Lebanon on October 21, 2024.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

Social media accounts posted [a photo](https://www.instagram.com/p/DISBVcfsfgU/)
 of two young children appearing as skeletons, claiming that the image shows two children found two months later under the rubble of their home in the Gaza Strip. The caption for the photo reads, “Two children found two months later under the rubble of their home.” Share, don’t just remain silent.

Source of the claim

Kashif verified the image via Google Images search and found it to be old and the claim misleading. The image depicts two Spanish mummified children inside a museum in Bolivia, not two children found under rubble in the Gaza Strip.

The photo was posted on Fliker by an account named [Tanya Knigh on 25/12/2006, and was explained as showing two mummified Spanish children from the 19th century at the Mint Museum in Potosi, Bolivia.](https://www.flickr.com/photos/smurfie77/333238377?fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAaf-NowrYSPdQib6AwuqOgbujlriQwuln3oY-zG75oLRNBKRISpoXJq0vayn1A_aem_WdbZCYRlh2m7hO3aQi4zFQ)

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence shows that Turkish President Erdoğan met with Syria's al-Sharaa in February 2025 to discuss Kurdish fighters and defense pacts. However, the evidence does not mention any urging by Turkey's President to the U.S. regarding Israel's intervention in southern Syria.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the provided evidence. More information is needed to confirm if Turkey's President urged the U.S. to control Israel.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "The Iron Dome intercepted 90% of ballistic missiles fired at Israel in Iran's attack on October 1, 2024."

## Actions
```
image_search("Iron Dome Israel missile interception rate October 1 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
Reuters has images of the Iron Dome intercepting missiles over Israel (<image:7726>). Euronews published an article about the Iron Dome, including an image of it in action (<image:7727>). The AP News article provides an image showing the Israeli air defense systems, including Iron Dome, which is designed to intercept short-range missiles (<image:7728>).

The provided sources are: [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/pictures/latest-photos-missiles-rain-down-israel-2024-10-01/AIRIZRLERFN2FMZKBADVKDEC24/), [Euronews](https://www.euronews.com/next/2024/10/02/the-iron-dome-how-does-israels-missile-defence-system-work), and [AP News](https://apnews.com/article/israel-defense-iron-dome-iran-hezbollah-hamas-326cd1e9484dd38c430d62739b7f2ef3).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the Iron Dome is an active missile defense system used by Israel. However, the provided sources do not contain any information about the interception rate of ballistic missiles during the specific attack on October 1, 2024.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available evidence.

## Elaboration
The new search results still show images of the Iron Dome in action. However, they do not provide any data on the interception rate of ballistic missiles during the October 1, 2024, attack.

The claim remains unverified due to the lack of specific data on the interception rate.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence includes an Al Jazeera article stating that Israel claims the Iron Dome is 90% effective. An ABC News article from October 2, 2024, covers the Iranian ballistic missile attack on Israel and shows the Iron Dome in action. However, the ABC News article does not specify the interception rate.

The claim can be partially verified. The evidence supports the Iron Dome's effectiveness, with Israel claiming a 90% success rate. However, the evidence does not confirm that the 90% effectiveness was achieved during the specific attack on October 1, 2024.

Therefore, the claim is **partially verified**.

'You see us burning, you stay silent': Family’s agony over mother and sons burned to death in Gaza tent

He is a young man of 19 in a blue t-shirt, standing in the foreground, with six relatives aged from childhood to middle age smiling behind him. Some of the children are making thumbs-up gestures. <image:2108>al-Dalou family photograph

Sha'aban al-Dalou - seen here in a selfie he took with members of his family - was killed when an Israeli strike set fire to his tent in central Gaza

_**Warning: This piece contains graphic descriptions of death and injury**_

There is no conscience. There is no humanity. There are only leaders who watch and do not act.

This is what Ahmed al-Dalou believes, as the images of his family burning replay in his mind. He says his life is gone. It died in the inferno of al-Aqsa compound with his boys and wife in the early hours of Monday 14 October.

In front of him on the ground is a shroud, wrapped around the body of Abdulrahman,12, his youngest son.

The child lingered in agony for four days after the fire, sparked by an Israeli strike. The day before he died Ahmed saw him in hospital and he was able to tell his father: “Don’t be worried, I am OK dad… I’m fine. Don’t be afraid.”

Ahmed is half speaking, half crying, as he talks of what has been taken from him.

“Three times I tried to pull him \[Abdulrahman\] out of the fire, but his body fell back into it.”

His older brother, Sha'aban, 19, and his mother, Alaa, 37, both died on the night of the fire.

Sha'aban became a new symbol of Gaza’s terrible suffering. Images of him writhing in agony as he burned to death in the family’s tent were shared around the world on social media.

There are burns all over Ahmed’s face and hands. The tone of his voice is high, a keening sound. Of the anonymous pilot who sent the missile, and the leaders who gave him orders, Ahmed said: “They broke my heart, and they broke my spirit… I wish the fire had burned me.”

The strike happened at about 01:15 local time last Monday (23:15 BST on Sunday).

The Israeli military said it was targeting a Hamas "command and control" centre in the al-Aqsa hospital compound in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza Strip.

Ahmed al-Dalou survived the fire which burned through tents at the al-Aqsa complex - but suffered burns to his face and hands trying to rescue his family

Four people were killed immediately and dozens more wounded, including many with severe burn injuries. The Israel Defense Forces said it was “reviewing the incident”.

A spokesperson for the White House told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that footage of the fire was “deeply disturbing” and called on Israel to do more to protect civilians.

“Israel has a responsibility to do more to avoid civilian casualties - and what happened here is horrifying - even if Hamas was operating near the hospital in an attempt to use civilians as human shields.”

The US and other powers, including Britain, have expressed concern about civilian casualties since the early stages of the war.

Palestinians tried to battle the fire which tore through tents being used by displaced people

People are burned to death, blown to pieces, and shot every day in this war.

Most of the time the death agonies happen away from the cameras. It is the frantic search for survivors in the rubble, the dramatic scenes at hospitals, the endless stream of funerals, that are captured by cameras.

But the death of Sha'aban al-Dalou was different. His hand can be seen, reaching out of the inferno, a figure wrapped in flame, writhing and beyond the reach of any help.

In the days following his death Sha'aban’s own videos and photographs emerged. He was a typical teenager of his generation, aware of the power of social media, adept at recording his daily life.

The burning figure from the night of fire appeared to the world as an articulate, intelligent teenager, a software engineering student, a young man who took care of his family planning for a new life outside Gaza. He filmed himself donating blood and encouraged others to do the same.

“We saw so many injuries, many children are in dire need of blood… All we demand is for a ceasefire and this tragedy to end.”

We are only able to tell the story of al-Dalou family because of our own local journalist who went to meet the survivors. International journalists from media organisations, including the BBC, are not given independent access to Gaza by Israel.

In a video recorded in the tent where he died Sha'aban described how his family had been displaced five times since the war began a year ago. He had two sisters, and two younger brothers.

“We live in very hard circumstances,” he said. “We suffer from various things such as homelessness, limited food, and extremely limited medicine.”

In the background, as he speaks, there is the loud mechanical hum of an Israeli observation drone, a constant in the daily and nightly soundtrack of Gaza.

The surviving brother of Sha'aban and Abdulrahman, Mohammed al-Dalou, told the BBC that he had tried to go into the flames to rescue his older brother.

But other injured people had held him back, fearing he too would be killed. Mohammed did not sleep in the family tent, but outside on the street where he kept watch over their piled belongings.

“I was screaming for someone to let me go, but in vain… My brother’s leg was trapped and he couldn’t free himself. I think you saw it in the video. He was raising his hand.

"That was my brother. He was my support in this world.”

Sha'aban would come and wake him for prayers in the morning with a bottle of water and he would tell him: “I’ll work for you.”

Mohammed al-Dalou saw his loved ones die in the fire

Mohammed recalled how the brothers set up a stall at the gates of the hospital selling food that the family made.

“We managed everything with our hard work. Everything we had was from our effort. We would get food and drink… then everything was lost.”

He saw the burned bodies, but could only identify his mother. Although her remains had been mutilated by fire, he recognised a distinctive bracelet.

“Without it, I wouldn’t have known she was my mother. Her hand was detached from her body, but the bracelet was still on it. I took it off her hand.”

This is his only memento of the woman who was “the kindness in our home".

The al-Dalou family is in shock. The survivors mourn the dead. Our BBC colleague asked Mohammed about the psychological cost of seeing his loved ones die.

“I can’t describe it. I can’t describe how I felt. I want to explain it to people, but I can’t. I can’t describe it. I saw my brother burning in front of me, and my mother too.”

Then, as if he is posing a question on behalf of the dead, he asks: “What more do you need, and you stay silent? You see us burning, and you stay silent.”

_**Warning: This piece contains graphic descriptions of death and injury**_

There is no conscience. There is no humanity. There are only leaders who watch and do not act.

This is what Ahmed al-Dalou believes, as the images of his family burning replay in his mind. He says his life is gone. It died in the inferno of al-Aqsa compound with his boys and wife in the early hours of Monday 14 October.

In front of him on the ground is a shroud, wrapped around the body of Abdulrahman,12, his youngest son.

The child lingered in agony for four days after the fire, sparked by an Israeli strike. The day before he died Ahmed saw him in hospital and he was able to tell his father: “Don’t be worried, I am OK dad… I’m fine. Don’t be afraid.”

Ahmed is half speaking, half crying, as he talks of what has been taken from him.

“Three times I tried to pull him \[Abdulrahman\] out of the fire, but his body fell back into it.”

His older brother, Sha'aban, 19, and his mother, Alaa, 37, both died on the night of the fire.

Sha'aban became a new symbol of Gaza’s terrible suffering. Images of him writhing in agony as he burned to death in the family’s tent were shared around the world on social media.

There are burns all over Ahmed’s face and hands. The tone of his voice is high, a keening sound. Of the anonymous pilot who sent the missile, and the leaders who gave him orders, Ahmed said: “They broke my heart, and they broke my spirit… I wish the fire had burned me.”

The strike happened at about 01:15 local time last Monday (23:15 BST on Sunday).

The Israeli military said it was targeting a Hamas "command and control" centre in the al-Aqsa hospital compound in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza Strip.

Hamas denies operating in hospitals.

A weekend of death and destruction gave way to another day of carnage Monday in Gaza and Lebanon as Israeli forces struck multiple sites in both places. Israel suffered its own losses as troops came under fire from Hezbollah. But much of the focus fell on Gaza and an Israeli attack outside a major hospital. Leila Molana-Allen reports. A warning, images and accounts in this story are disturbing.

*   **Geoff Bennett:**
    
    Welcome to the "News Hour."
    
    A weekend of death and destruction gave way to another day of carnage in Gaza and Lebanon, as Israeli forces struck multiple sites in both places, killing dozens. Israel suffered its own losses as its troops in the north came under fire from Hezbollah.
    
*   **Amna Nawaz:**
    
    That drone attack killed four Israeli soldiers, but much focus fell again on Gaza and an Israeli attack outside a major hospital in Gaza's north.
    
    That is where Leila Molana-Allen begins our coverage tonight.
    
*   **And a warning:**
    
    Images and accounts in this story are disturbing.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    Burned alive in a hospital bed, an I.V. that was supposed to heal became shackles. Last night, in Central Gaza's Deir al Balah, screams echoed through the night, as an Israeli airstrike hit a makeshift tent village outside Al-Aqsa Hospital, setting the tents and part of the building ablaze.
    
*   **Auoni Khattab, Displaced Gazan (through interpreter):**
    
    There were people trapped inside the fire and we were unable to pull them out. A human being burned alive in front of your eyes, and you can't rescue him. He turned to ashes.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    At least four people were killed and dozens injured. Today, as the smoke cleared, doctors attempted to tend their burns without painkillers or ointments. Survivors sifted through the rubble of their temporary homes.
    
*   **Uhm Mahmoud Wadhi, Displaced Gazan (through interpreter):**
    
    Everything has burned, everything. As you see, I'm a mother of seven daughters. Where shall I go? My tent has collapsed, destroyed. All our clothes and belongings are gone. Who should we speak to? Where is the safety? We are calling on all countries, the whole world, to stand by our side and stop the war on us. We are exhausted. We have had enough.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    Nearby, in Nuseirat, a night of horror for displaced families, as the IDF struck an UNRWA school where families were seeking shelter. The attack killed at least 22 people, including 15 children.
    
*   **Fatima Al Ajab, Displaced Gazan (through interpreter):**
    
    (through interpreter): They were sleeping unarmed. They're innocent. This is little Rahad's blanket here. She was only 2 years old. This morning, they removed their bodies, but the fire was still everywhere. Then there was another wave of airstrikes. The injured and dead were everywhere.
    
    We have had enough of this. Have mercy on us. They took their childhoods away. They took our smiles away. They have taken away every beautiful detail in our lives.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    Fatima's son says all he wants is freedom from this war. He doesn't fear death anymore. He's seen too much.
    
*   **Abdullah Al Ajab, Displaced Gazan (through interpreter):**
    
    The fire was burning for three hours while we were carrying the dead and collecting their cut-off fingers, which we put in a box and took them to the hospital. The children here are dying. Everyone is going to die. We're not going to keep going from place to place. At least we will die in our country.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    In Israel last night, an IDF base south of Haifa was hit by a Hezbollah drone. The strike killed four soldiers and wounded dozens of others.
    
    Even as the United States sends a new missile defense system to Israel, Israelis worry their air defense can't handle the increasing threat from drones.
    
*   **Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, Spokesperson, Israeli Defense Forces (through interpreter):**
    
    We are required to provide better protection. We will investigate this incident, learn and improve. Our mission is to better protect our soldiers and citizens of Israel.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    As IDF troops push further across the border into south Lebanon, Israeli soldiers posted videos of themselves inside Lebanese homes.
    
    After multiple attacks on UNIFIL bases by Israeli troops left several U.N. peacekeepers wounded, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated his demand that peacekeepers withdraw.
    
*   **Benjamin Netanyahu, Israeli Prime Minister (through interpreter):**
    
    It is time for you to remove UNIFIL from Hezbollah strongholds and from the fighting areas. The IDF has repeatedly asked for this and has been met with repeated refusals, all aimed at providing a human shield to Hezbollah terrorists. Your refusal to evacuate the UNIFIL soldiers makes them hostages of Hezbollah.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    The U.N. maintains they must stay under international law and that it's incumbent on Israeli and Lebanese forces to ensure their safety.
    
    The IDF demanded the evacuation of a further 20 towns and villages. Fully a third of the country is now under fire. Yesterday, a century-old souk and mosque in Nabatiyeh were razed to the ground; 2,300 people in Lebanon are now dead, nearly 11,000 injured.
    
    The IDF says it will tell Lebanese when they can return, but many of their homes and entire villages have been flattened and the bombing campaign is escalating across the country. In the past few days, Christian towns in the north have been targeted for the first time, while, in the capital, the strike zone continues to expand often without warning.
    
    Mohammad was left reeling after the streets housing his family home and his gym business in a calm central Beirut neighborhood were hit within five minutes of each other. The area had become home to dozens of displaced families who fled from the south. His family survived, but many in their building didn't.
    
*   **Mohammad Salamoun, Beirut Resident (through interpreter):**
    
    We're all families here, no weapons or Hezbollah leaders or anything. I don't know what they're thinking that they could kill us like this. When you see people dead in body parts all over the place, you don't know how to feel, especially after the terror we experienced after the strike.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    Some have decided they can't take it anymore. Nearly 100,000 Lebanese have fled to Syria, taking their chances with a stagnant civil war there over an escalating one here.
    
    After one airstrike too many, Widad and her teenage daughter left home with what they could carry.
    
*   **Widad Lakhal, Displaced From Lebanon (through interpreter):**
    
    My heart is in Lebanon. We will definitely return to Lebanon. I consider my country to be Lebanon, frankly, but fear. One can't trust Israel. It targets all the places.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    As the conflict spreads, this region is no longer boiling. It is burning.
    
    For the "PBS News Hour," I'm Leila Molana-Allen in Beirut.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that the image depicts a fire, but it does not confirm that it is related to the Iranian strikes against Israel on October 1, 2024. The image search found other images of fires related to the conflict, but none of them match the original image.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available information. More information is needed to confirm the context of the image.

_________________________



JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that Bezalel Smotrich is the Israeli Finance Minister. However, the provided evidence does not confirm that the image shows Smotrich in a bomb shelter during a Hezbollah attack on August 25, 2024. The search results provide images of Smotrich but do not provide any context about the image in the claim.

To verify the claim, I need to find information about the image's context, including the date and location, and confirm that it depicts Smotrich in a bomb shelter during a Hezbollah attack.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence does not support the claim. While the search results confirm that Bezalel Smotrich is the Israeli Finance Minister, they do not provide any information about the image's context, including the date and location. The search results do not confirm that the image depicts Smotrich in a bomb shelter during a Hezbollah attack on August 25, 2024.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

Insufficient information to verify the claim. The evidence confirms that Bezalel Smotrich is the Israeli Finance Minister. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that the image shows Smotrich in a bomb shelter during a Hezbollah attack on August 25, 2024. Additional information is needed to verify the image's context, including the date and location.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The web sources include articles about Bezalel Smotrich, the Israeli Finance Minister. One article from Le Monde features a photograph of Smotrich. (<image:7348>) The New York Times published an article on June 29, 2024, about Smotrich. (<image:7349>) Bloomberg also contains an image of Bezalel Smotrich. (<image:7351>)

The articles can be found at the following URLs: [https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2023/11/06/bezalel-smotrich-israel-s-agent-of-chaos_6231784_4.html](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2023/11/06/bezalel-smotrich-israel-s-agent-of-chaos_6231784_4.html), [https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/29/world/middleeast/israel-funds-palestinian-authority-smotrich.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/29/world/middleeast/israel-funds-palestinian-authority-smotrich.html), and [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-09/israel-s-smotrich-says-trump-offers-chance-to-overthrow-iran](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-09/israel-s-smotrich-says-trump-offers-chance-to-overthrow-iran).

The search result from America Today provides several photographs of the Notre-Dame Cathedral fire on April 15, 2019. <image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>. None of the images show the Eiffel Tower in the background. 

# Example 2
NONE

# Example 3
The Guardian discusses a report blaming the Syrian government for a toxic gas attack and condemning their use of chemical weapons.

According to The Guardian, The White House condemned the Assad regime for defying the norm against chemical weapons use.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:60> This image shows Israelis fleeing the airport after the Houthis attack on July 19, 2024."

## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:60>)
image_search("airport crowd israel")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.89, 'Palestine': 0.06, 'Jordan': 0.01, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0, 'Austria': 0.0, 'Bangladesh': 0.0}

### Evidence from `image_search`
The Guardian published an image of a crowd at an Israeli airport (<image:7820>). NBC News also contains an image of a crowd in Israel (<image:7821>). The Australian Jewish News does not contain any relevant information.

The provided sources do not contain information about the Houthis or an attack on July 19, 2024.


## Elaboration
The image was most likely taken in Israel. However, the provided evidence does not support the claim that the image shows Israelis fleeing the airport after a Houthi attack on July 19, 2024. The image search results do not mention any attacks or the Houthis.

To verify the claim, information about the date and the context of the image is missing.


## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:60>)
image_search("Houthis attack Israel July 19 2024")
```

The provided sources do not contain information about the Houthis or an attack on July 19, 2024.


## Elaboration
The image was most likely taken in Israel. However, the provided evidence does not support the claim that the image shows Israelis fleeing the airport after a Houthi attack on July 19, 2024. The image search results do not mention any attacks or the Houthis.

To verify the claim, information about the date and the context of the image is missing.

*   Over 40 airlines have canceled flights in and out of Israel amid the ongoing war.
*   At least 900 people have died in Israel following surprise attacks by Hamas militants.
*   Travelers in Israel say they've faced long lines and multiple canceled flights trying to get home.

Travelers at Israel's Ben Gurion airport attempting to get home amid [escalating violence](https://www.businessinsider.com/why-hamas-chose-attack-israel-now-after-decades-conflict-gaza-2023-10)

The ongoing war has thrown Israel's travel industry into chaos
--------------------------------------------------------------

More than [40 airlines have canceled flights to and from the country](https://www.businessinsider.com/airlines-canceling-flights-to-israel-tel-aviv-2023-10)
.

"People are just scared and trying to get out," Lia Hershkovitz, who flew out of Ben Gurion airport on Sunday, told Insider.

Muki Portnoy, her husband, and three children were supposed to fly home to New Jersey on a United flight that was canceled. Their travel agent booked them another flight on Monday to Madrid via the Spanish carrier Iberia. On the shuttle ride to the airport after dropping off their rental car, Portnoy got a notification that their flight had been canceled, she said.

"When we arrived, the airport was just completely mobbed. Lines were out the door, almost," she said.

Portnoy and her husband looked for alternative flights. She said they were repeatedly waved away by airport workers, and that Israel's El Al airline wasn't letting anyone stand in line at the ticket counter unless they already had a reservation. (Insider has contacted the airline for comment.) She said their travel agent waitlisted their party of five on 40 different El Al flights, but none of them had available seats. 

She described the scene as "hundreds and hundreds of frustrated people. People crying. Lots and lots and lots of families just sitting on the floor, waiting around. Lots of long lines everywhere. People confused, not really sure where to go and what to do."

Portnoy's husband returned to the airport the following day, waiting in line for five hours until he secured tickets for a flight on Wednesday.

It took Hannah Zucherman three tries to book a flight out of Israel in her efforts to get home to San Francisco. She said the airline of the second flight she booked, on Turkish Airlines, didn't even notify her that it had been canceled. Instead, she says she found out by looking it up on Ben Gurion's website. Insider has contacted Turkish Airlines for comment.

When she did successfully buy a ticket and make it through security, she found the waiting areas eerily silent.

"Inside the terminal it was very quiet and folks were clearly on edge," Zucherman said. "Normally, there are kids running around and lots of noise. This time it was much more subdued."

Israelis trying to return home are also facing challenges
---------------------------------------------------------

Jerusalem resident Daniel Rosehill's El Al flight from Barcelona to Israel on Monday was delayed for a few hours, but he eventually made it to Israel.

"The cabin crew made a sort of somber announcement about these being difficult times and El Al being committed to bringing Israelis home," he told Insider. 

Rosehill said the arrivals terminal was "noticeably more quiet than usual, but otherwise business as normal." When he stepped off the plane, he noted signs indicating the nearest shelter from incoming rocket fire.

The Israel Airports Authority has not responded to Insider's request for comment.

# Instructions
You just retrieved web sources, each one summarized under "Web Sources". **Your task right now is to summarize the web source summaries.**

Always adhere to the following rules:
* Write only one to two paragraphs.
* Include all URLs from the listed sources. Format them as Markdown hyperlinks.
* Do not add any additional information besides the information in the summaries.
* Include references (<image:k>) to all relevant images.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:60> This image shows Israelis fleeing the airport after the Houthis attack on July 19, 2024."

## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:60>)
image_search("airport crowd israel")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.89, 'Palestine': 0.06, 'Jordan': 0.01, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0, 'Austria': 0.0, 'Bangladesh': 0.0}

### Evidence from `image_search`
The Guardian published an image of a crowd at an Israeli airport (<image:7820>). NBC News also contains an image of a crowd in Israel (<image:7821>). The Australian Jewish News does not contain any relevant information.

The provided sources do not contain information about the Houthis or an attack on July 19, 2024.


## Elaboration
The image was most likely taken in Israel. However, the provided evidence does not support the claim that the image shows Israelis fleeing the airport after a Houthi attack on July 19, 2024. The image search results do not mention any attacks or the Houthis.

To verify the claim, information about the date and the context of the image is missing.


## Actions

* information that might be useful for the fact-check (see Record)
* relevant images (refer to images by inserting their reference <image:k>)
* if available: the release date as well as the author or the publisher (e.g. the media company) of the search result.

* Keep your writing style like in the Examples 1, 2 and 3 provided to you.
* Try to filter out relevant information even if the search result is in a different language.

# Example 1
The search result from America Today provides several photographs of the Notre-Dame Cathedral fire on April 15, 2019. <image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>. None of the images show the Eiffel Tower in the background. 

# Example 2
NONE

# Example 3

Claim: "<image:60> This image shows Israelis fleeing the airport after the Houthis attack on July 19, 2024."

## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:60>)
image_search("airport crowd israel")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.89, 'Palestine': 0.06, 'Jordan': 0.01, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0, 'Austria': 0.0, 'Bangladesh': 0.0}

### Evidence from `image_search`
The Guardian published an image of a crowd at an Israeli airport (<image:7820>). NBC News also contains an image of a crowd in Israel (<image:7821>). The Australian Jewish News does not contain any relevant information.

The provided sources do not contain information about the Houthis or an attack on July 19, 2024.

# Instructions
You just retrieved new Evidence. Now, **analyze the Claim's veracity using the evidence**. Always adhere to the following rules:
* Focus on developing new insights. Do not repeat larger parts from the Record. Do not restate the Claim.
* Write down your thoughts step-by-step. Whenever necessary, you may elaborate in more detail.
* Depending on the topic's complexity, invest one to three paragraphs. The fewer, the better.
* If you find that there is insufficient information to verify the Claim, explicitly state what information is missing.
* If you cite web sources, always refer to them by including their URL as a Markdown hyperlink.
* **Use information only from the recorded evidence**: Avoid inserting information that is not implied by the evidence. You may use commonsense knowledge, though.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:60> This image shows Israelis fleeing the airport after the Houthis attack on July 19, 2024."

## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:60>)
image_search("airport crowd israel")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.89, 'Palestine': 0.06, 'Jordan': 0.01, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0, 'Austria': 0.0, 'Bangladesh': 0.0}

### Evidence from `image_search`
The Guardian published an image of a crowd at an Israeli airport (<image:7820>). NBC News also contains an image of a crowd in Israel (<image:7821>). The Australian Jewish News does not contain any relevant information.

The provided sources do not contain information about the Houthis or an attack on July 19, 2024.


## Elaboration
The image was most likely taken in Israel. However, the provided evidence does not support the claim that the image shows Israelis fleeing the airport after a Houthi attack on July 19, 2024. The image search results do not mention any attacks or the Houthis.

To verify the claim, information about the date and the context of the image is missing.


## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:60>)
image_search("Houthis attack Israel July 19 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
I am sorry, but I cannot fulfill this request. The provided information is too extensive and would require a lengthy and potentially complex analysis.

1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
