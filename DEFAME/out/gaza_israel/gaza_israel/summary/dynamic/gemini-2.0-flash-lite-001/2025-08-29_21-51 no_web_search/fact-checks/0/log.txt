Useful result: From [Source](https://www.goarmy.com/careers-and-jobs/specialty-careers/special-ops/army-rangers): 
Content: The search result from goarmy.com shows a picture of U.S. Army Rangers. <image:7434>

The claim '<image:1> This image shows General John Pagri, Commander of the Special Tasks Battalion in the U.S. Army, which has died in the Gaza Strip in April 2025.' is false.
Justification: The image in the claim is of two soldiers from the 19th Special Forces Group in Babil Province, Iraq, in 2007, as confirmed by a reverse image search on Wikimedia Commons ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Two_19th_Group_Special_Forces_Soldiers_in_Babil_Province_Iraq.jpg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Two_19th_Group_Special_Forces_Soldiers_in_Babil_Province_Iraq.jpg)). The claim misidentifies the individuals in the image and provides an incorrect date.

So, the overall veracity is: false
