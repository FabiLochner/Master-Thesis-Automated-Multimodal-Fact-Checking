## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (![image 10](media/10.jpg)) of a plane landing at Beirut International Airport surrounded by explosions is AI-generated, according to fact-check articles. India Today ([https://www.indiatoday.in/fact-check/story/fact-check-photo-middle-east-airlines-flight-israel-airstrikes-beirut-lebanon-ai-generated-2622766-2024-10-24](https://www.indiatoday.in/fact-check/story/fact-check-photo-middle-east-airlines-flight-israel-airstrikes-beirut-lebanon-ai-generated-2622766-2024-10-24)) and Factly.in ([https://factly.in/an-ai-generated-image-of-a-plane-landing-at-beirut-international-airport-surrounded-by-fire-and-smoke-is-falsely-shared-as-real/](https://factly.in/an-ai-generated-image-of-a-plane-landing-at-beirut-international-airport-surrounded-by-fire-and-smoke-is-falsely-shared-as-real/)) both confirm this, with the latter noting the image was posted on Instagram with a caption acknowledging its AI origin.

The articles also mention the use of AI detection tools to verify the image's AI-generated nature. Factly.in's article was authored by Nitish Kumar Dhonge and includes additional images (![image 321](media/2025-07-18_13-39-1752845988-189557.jpg), ![image 322](media/2025-07-18_13-39-1752845990-391928.jpg), ![image 323](media/2025-07-18_13-39-1752845991-912763.jpg)).


### Evidence from `image_search`
The ABC News website published an article on July 14, 2006, about Israel bombing Beirut airport, including an image of an airplane with smoke and fire in the background (![image 7461](media/2025-08-29_21-53-1756504423-769973.jpg)). Al Jazeera also reported on Israel bombing Beirut airport (![image 7462](media/2025-08-29_21-53-1756504424-048063.jpg)).

The provided sources do not contain information about an image matching the claim.


## Elaboration
The claim is false. The image is AI-generated, as confirmed by fact-check articles from India Today ([https://www.indiatoday.in/fact-check/story/fact-check-photo-middle-east-airlines-flight-israel-airstrikes-beirut-lebanon-ai-generated-2622766-2024-10-24](https://www.indiatoday.in/fact-check/story/fact-check-photo-middle-east-airlines-flight-israel-airstrikes-beirut-lebanon-ai-generated-2622766-2024-10-24)) and Factly.in ([https://factly.in/an-ai-generated-image-of-a-plane-landing-at-beirut-international-airport-surrounded-by-fire-and-smoke-is-falsely-shared-as-real/](https://factly.in/an-ai-generated-image-of-a-plane-landing-at-beirut-international-airport-surrounded-by-fire-and-smoke-is-falsely-shared-as-real/)).
