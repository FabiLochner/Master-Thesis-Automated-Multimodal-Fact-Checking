## Claim
Claim: "![image 23](media/34.jpg) This image shows Israel bombing Tehran on October 26, 2024."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(![image 23](media/34.jpg))
image_search("fire explosion city night")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image ![image 23](media/34.jpg)

### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include an image of a nuclear explosion over a city at night from [Shutterstock](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/nuclear-explosion-city-night-739253215) ![image 7537](media/2025-08-29_21-56-1756504575-512270.jpg), an article from the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/09/us/west-virginia-explosion.html) about an explosion at a chemical plant in West Virginia ![image 7538](media/2025-08-29_21-56-1756504575-716637.jpg), and an image of a city engulfed in flames at night from [Stockcake](https://stockcake.com/i/city-engulfed-flames_1034836_127136) ![image 7539](media/2025-08-29_21-56-1756504576-018835.jpg).


## Elaboration
The evidence does not provide any information about the image's origin or the event it depicts. The reverse image search did not yield any results. The image search results show similar images of explosions and fires, but none of them match the original image.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available evidence. More information is needed to determine the context of the image.
