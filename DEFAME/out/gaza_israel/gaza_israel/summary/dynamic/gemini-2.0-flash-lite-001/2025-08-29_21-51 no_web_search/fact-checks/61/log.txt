Useful result: From [Source](https://www.hrw.org/report/2024/12/19/extermination-and-acts-genocide/israel-deliberately-depriving-palestinians-gaza): 
Content: Human Rights Watch published a report on December 19, 2024, about the situation in Gaza, including an image of people in Gaza. <image:7699>

The claim '<image:36> This image shows a Palestinian woman using an Israeli tank to dry clothes in Gaza in July 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim cannot be verified. While the image's location is likely Palestine, and other images confirm the existence of Israeli tanks and people in Gaza, there is no evidence to support the specific scenario of a Palestinian woman using an Israeli tank to dry clothes, nor is there any information about the date.

So, the overall veracity is: false
