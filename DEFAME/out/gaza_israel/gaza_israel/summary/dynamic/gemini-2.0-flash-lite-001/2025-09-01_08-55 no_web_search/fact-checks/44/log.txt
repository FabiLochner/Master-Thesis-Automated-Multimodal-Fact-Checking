Useful result: From [Source](https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/president-joe-biden-holds-the-book-the-hundred-years-war-on-news-photo/2186864238): 
Content: Getty Images published an image of President Joe Biden holding a copy of "The Hundred Years' War on Palestine" by Rashid Khalidi. <image:14194>

The claim '<image:28> This image authentically shows U.S. President Joe Boden in late November 2024 exiting a Nantucket bookstore holding a copy of writer Rashid Khalidi's book, 'The Hundred Years' War on Palestine: A History of Settler Colonialism and Resistance, 1917–2017.'' is false.
Justification: The claim is not fully supported. While evidence confirms that Joe Biden was photographed exiting Nantucket Bookworks and holding a copy of "The Hundred Years' War on Palestine" by Rashid Khalidi, the evidence does not confirm that both events occurred simultaneously. The image of Biden holding the book was published by Getty Images ([https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/president-joe-biden-holds-the-book-the-hundred-years-war-on-news-photo/2186864238](https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/president-joe-biden-holds-the-book-the-hundred-years-war-on-news-photo/2186864238)), but the location and date are not explicitly confirmed.

So, the overall veracity is: false
