## Elaboration
The claim that the image was taken by a Hezbollah drone in August 2024 is not supported by the evidence. The image is of Benjamin Netanyahu's house and was taken in 2019, according to a fact-check. The image was featured in a Times of Israel article. The image was also found on the website [https://pesacheck.org/missing-context-this-image-of-israeli-prime-minister-benjamin-netanyahus-home-was-not-captured-by-9d48e97d86b7](https://pesacheck.org/missing-context-this-image-of-israeli-prime-minister-benjamin-netanyahus-home-was-not-captured-by-9d48e97d86b7).

The evidence suggests that the image is of Benjamin Netanyahu's house, but the claim about the source and date of the image is false. The image was not taken by a Hezbollah drone in August 2024.
