Content: Bloomberg reports on the French far-right parties and their coalition against Macron. The article includes an image of Marine Le Pen. <image:14111>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/france-shifts-left-risk-policy-paralysis-looms-2024-07-08/): 
Content: Reuters published an article about the French parliamentary elections in 2024. The article includes an image of a protest. <image:14112>

The claim '<image:20> This image shows the 'French' Left who is rioting against Le Pen's victory in the first round of the French parliamentary elections in 2024.' is false.
Justification: The image in the claim is from a 2014 pro-Palestinian demonstration in Paris, as evidenced by a Vanity Fair article ([https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/07/anti-semitism-france-hostage-hyper-cacher-kosher-market](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/07/anti-semitism-france-hostage-hyper-cacher-kosher-market)). This contradicts the claim that it depicts a 2024 protest against Le Pen's victory.

So, the overall veracity is: false
