## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (![image 13](media/15.jpg)) shows a traffic sign in Montreal displaying "Free Palestine. Escalate now."

The City of Montreal called the incident an act of vandalism. A group called Clash Mtl claimed responsibility.

## Elaboration
The claim that the image shows a traffic sign in Montreal displaying a "Free Palestine. Escalate now" message is supported by the evidence. The reverse image search confirms the image's existence and location in Montreal. The evidence indicates that the signs were hacked and the City of Montreal considered it an act of vandalism. The claim that the sign was authorized by Montreal's Mayor Valérie Plante is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The image does show a traffic sign in Montreal displaying "Free Palestine. Escalate now." However, the evidence indicates that the signs were hacked and the City of Montreal considered it an act of vandalism. There is no evidence to support the claim that the sign was authorized by Montreal's Mayor Valérie Plante. Therefore, the claim is partially false. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification

The claim that the message was authorized by Montreal's Mayor Valérie Plante is not supported by the evidence.
