The claim 'The population in Gaza has increased by 2.02% since Oct. 7, 2023.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. The provided evidence, including an OCHA map ([https://www.unocha.org/publications/map/occupied-palestinian-territory/opt-gaza-strip-population-and-internal-displacement-7-october-2023-16-november-2024](https://www.unocha.org/publications/map/occupied-palestinian-territory/opt-gaza-strip-population-and-internal-displacement-7-october-2023-16-november-2024)) and a BBC article ([https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/articles/c1dggqr6351o](https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/articles/c1dggqr6351o)), suggests a decrease in population since October 7, 2023, not an increase.

So, the overall veracity is: false
