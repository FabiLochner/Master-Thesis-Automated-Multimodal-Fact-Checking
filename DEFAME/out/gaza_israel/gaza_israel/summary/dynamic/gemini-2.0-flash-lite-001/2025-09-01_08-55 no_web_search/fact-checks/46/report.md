## Elaboration
The evidence provides some information about Bob Geldof and U2. Getty Images ([https://www.gettyimages.com/photos/bob-hewson](https://www.gettyimages.com/photos/bob-hewson)) shows a picture of Bob Geldof and Bono on stage, suggesting they have performed together. Redraven.news ([https://redraven.news/2024/11/27/an-evening-with-bob-geldof-songs-and-stories-from-an-extraordinary-life/](https://redraven.news/2024/11/27/an-evening-with-bob-geldof-songs-and-stories-from-an-extraordinary-life/)) features an image of Bob Geldof announcing a tour in New Zealand in March 2025.

However, there is no evidence to support the claim that U2 and Bob Geldof announced a tour in November 2024 to aid the Israeli army. The evidence does not mention any tour for that purpose or timeframe.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.

Hifiway.live ([https://hifiway.live/2024/11/01/an-evening-with-bob-geldof-in-march-2025/](https://hifiway.live/2024/11/01/an-evening-with-bob-geldof-in-march-2025/)) shows Bob Geldof's tour dates in Australia and New Zealand in March and April 2025. ![image 14204](media/2025-09-01_09-12-1756717944-821493.jpg) Eventalaide.com features an image of Bob Geldof announcing a tour in Australia in March-April 2025. ![image 14207](media/2025-09-01_09-12-1756717951-101026.jpg)



## Elaboration
The evidence shows U2 had tour dates in January and February 2024, and Bob Geldof has a tour scheduled for March-April 2025 in Australia and New Zealand. There is no mention of a U2 and Bob Geldof tour in November 2024. The evidence also does not mention any tour to aid the Israeli army.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that while U2 and Bob Geldof have been involved in musical performances and tours, there is no evidence to support the claim of a joint tour in November 2024 to aid the Israeli army. The search results show U2 tour dates in early 2024 and Bob Geldof's tour dates in 2025, but nothing matching the claim.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is unsupported. While U2 had tour dates in early 2024 and Bob Geldof has a tour scheduled for 2025, there is no evidence of a joint tour in November 2024, nor is there any mention of a tour to aid the Israeli army.
