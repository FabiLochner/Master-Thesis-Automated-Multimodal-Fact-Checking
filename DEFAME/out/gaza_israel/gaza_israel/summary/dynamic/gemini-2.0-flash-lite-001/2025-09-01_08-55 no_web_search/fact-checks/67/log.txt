The claim 'Turkey's President urged the U.S. in March 2025 to control its ally Israel over its intervention in southern Syria in February 2025.' is false.
Justification: The fact-check did not find any evidence to support the claim that Turkey's President urged the U.S. to control Israel in March 2025. While there were reports of discussions and meetings involving Turkey, Israel, and Syria, none of the sources mentioned Turkey requesting the U.S. to intervene. Therefore, the claim is unsupported.

So, the overall veracity is: false
