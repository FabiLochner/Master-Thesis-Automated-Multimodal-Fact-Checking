The claim 'Iran's IRGC Quds Force commander Gen. Esmail Qaani has fled Iran in April 2025 and is confirmed safe in Israel.' is false.
Justification: The available evidence, including multiple image searches and articles about Esmail Qaani, does not support the claim that he fled Iran in April 2025 and is confirmed safe in Israel. The search results provide images of Qaani and articles about him, but none confirm the claim. Therefore, the claim is unverified.

So, the overall veracity is: false
