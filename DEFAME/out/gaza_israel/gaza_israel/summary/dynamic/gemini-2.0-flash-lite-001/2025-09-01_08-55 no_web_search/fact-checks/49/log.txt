The claim 'On July 22, 2024, Vice President Kamala Harris said, 'Our support for Israel will continue' amid Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s visit to the United States.' is false.
Justification: The claim that Kamala Harris said, "Our support for Israel will continue" on July 22, 2024, cannot be verified. While evidence confirms a meeting between Harris and Benjamin Netanyahu on that date, multiple searches of news articles and statements from that time did not yield the specific quote in question.

So, the overall veracity is: false
