Axios ([Source](https://www.axios.com/2024/07/26/trump-netanyahu-meeting)) reports on a meeting between Trump and Netanyahu ![image 14209](media/2025-09-01_09-12-1756717960-812824.jpg).

## Elaboration
The new evidence reveals that Kamala Harris and Benjamin Netanyahu discussed a Gaza ceasefire. However, the evidence still does not provide any information about the date of the phone call between Trump and Netanyahu, nor does it confirm Trump's alleged statements about the ceasefire deal and Kamala Harris's campaign.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified due to the lack of specific information about the phone call's date and content.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that Trump and Netanyahu discussed a Gaza ceasefire, and Kamala Harris also discussed the same topic with Netanyahu. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that Trump told Netanyahu to stop a ceasefire deal because it would help Kamala Harris's campaign, nor is there any information about the date of the call.

The claim is not factually accurate because there is not enough evidence to verify it. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim cannot be verified. While there is evidence of discussions between Trump and Netanyahu regarding a Gaza ceasefire, and also between Kamala Harris and Netanyahu on the same topic, there is no evidence to support the specific claim about Trump's statements or the date of the phone call.
