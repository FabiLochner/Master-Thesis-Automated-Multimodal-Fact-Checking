Useful result: From [Source](https://www.ctvnews.ca/montreal/article/montreal-mayor-says-friday-pro-palestinian-protests-were-taken-over-by-professional-vandals/): 
Content: The CTV News article features a photograph of Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante. <image:14076>

The claim '<image:13> This image shows a traffic sign in Montreal in July 2024 which displays a 'Free Palestine. Escalate now' message and was authorized by Montreal's Mayor Valérie Plante.' is false.
Justification: The image depicts a traffic sign in Montreal displaying a "Free Palestine" message, which was the result of a hack and considered vandalism by the city, as reported by [CBC News](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/montreal-traffic-signs-pro-palestinian-slogans-1.7274809) and [The Globe and Mail](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-montreal-traffic-signs-apparently-hacked-to-display-pro-palestinian/). The claim that the message was authorized by Montreal's Mayor Valérie Plante is not supported by the evidence.

So, the overall veracity is: false
