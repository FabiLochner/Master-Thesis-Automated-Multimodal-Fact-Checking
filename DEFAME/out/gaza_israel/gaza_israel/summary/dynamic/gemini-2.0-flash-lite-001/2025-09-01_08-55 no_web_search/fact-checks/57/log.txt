The claim '<image:32> This image shows Palestinian baby Sham Imad Muhareb which did not lose her arm in an Israeli airstrike on the Shejaeya neighborhood, east of Gaza City, in April 2025.' is false.
Justification: The claim cannot be verified. While evidence confirms airstrikes in Gaza City, including the Shejaeya neighborhood, in April 2025, no information was found regarding a baby named Sham Imad Muhareb or whether she lost her arm in an airstrike.

So, the overall veracity is: false
