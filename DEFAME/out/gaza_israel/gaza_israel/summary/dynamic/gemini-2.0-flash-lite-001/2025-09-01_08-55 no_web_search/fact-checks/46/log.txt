The claim 'In November 2024, rock band U2 and singer Bob Geldof announced a multi-stadium tour to aid the Israeli army.' is false.
Justification: The claim is unsupported. While U2 had tour dates in early 2024 and Bob Geldof has a tour scheduled for 2025, there is no evidence of a joint tour in November 2024, nor is there any mention of a tour to aid the Israeli army.

So, the overall veracity is: false
