## Actions

image_search("Tomer Bar")
image_search("Tomer Bar killed")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include images of Major General Tomer Bar. One image is from DVIDS Hub ([https://www.dvidshub.net/image/7332048/csaf-attends-riat-2022](https://www.dvidshub.net/image/7332048/csaf-attends-riat-2022)) ![image 14136](media/2025-09-01_09-07-1756717625-869270.jpg), and another is from The Times of Israel ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/air-force-chief-reportedly-vows-to-keep-politics-away-from-service/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/air-force-chief-reportedly-vows-to-keep-politics-away-from-service/)) ![image 14137](media/2025-09-01_09-07-1756717626-179796.jpg).


## Elaboration
The image search results confirm the existence of Major General Tomer Bar. However, the search results do not provide any information about his death or any attacks.

The claim cannot be verified with the available evidence. Additional information is needed to confirm the alleged attack and the death of Major General Tomer Bar.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
Al Jazeera reports on Hеzbollаh drone attacks targeting Tel Aviv, including an image of a destroyed building (![image 14140](media/2025-09-01_09-07-1756717646-768479.jpg)) ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/7/hezbollah-attack-drones-target-tel-aviv-army-base-as-israel-pounds-lebanon](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/7/hezbollah-attack-drones-target-tel-aviv-army-base-as-israel-pounds-lebanon)). CNN reports on an explosion in Tel Aviv (![image 14141](media/2025-09-01_09-07-1756717647-094452.jpg)) ([https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/19/middleeast/israel-tel-aviv-explosion-us-embassy-intl-hnk](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/19/middleeast/israel-tel-aviv-explosion-us-embassy-intl-hnk)). ABC News published an article about an air strike (![image 14142](media/2025-09-01_09-07-1756717648-960322.jpg)) ([https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-08-25/air-strike-inside-lebanon-israel-says/104267610](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-08-25/air-strike-inside-lebanon-israel-says/104267610)).


## Elaboration
The new evidence reveals reports of Hеzbollаh drone attacks on Tel Aviv and explosions in the city. However, there is no mention of Major General Tomer Bar being killed in any of these attacks.

The claim remains unverified. The evidence confirms attacks in Tel Aviv but does not link them to the death of Major General Tomer Bar.


## Final Judgement
The image searches confirm the existence of Major General Tomer Bar and report on attacks in Tel Aviv. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that Major General Tomer Bar was killed in a drone attack in November 2024.

The decision option that best applies is `false`.


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The fact-check reveals that while Major General Tomer Bar exists and there have been reports of attacks in Tel Aviv, there is no evidence to support the claim that he was killed in a drone attack in November 2024. The search results from sources like [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/7/hezbollah-attack-drones-target-tel-aviv-army-base-as-israel-pounds-lebanon) and [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/19/middleeast/israel-tel-aviv-explosion-us-embassy-intl-hnk) confirm attacks but do not mention his death.
