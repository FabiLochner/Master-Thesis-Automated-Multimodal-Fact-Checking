The claim '<image:63> This image shows Mayar Hamida (9 years old) and Bilal Hamida (6 years old) who were killed by Israel along with their mother and grandmother at Al-Jaoni UN school in Al-Nuseirat refugee camp on July, 6 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim cannot be verified due to a lack of specific evidence. While image searches revealed reports of attacks on UN schools in Gaza, they did not confirm the specific details of the claim, such as the names, ages, and date.

So, the overall veracity is: false
