Useful result: From [Source](https://kashif.ps/en/index.php/2025/04/14/images-of-demonstration-in-solidarity-with-palestine-from-bangladesh-circulate-as-from-india/): 
Content: The search result from kashif.ps shows an image of a demonstration in solidarity with Palestine. The source states that images from Bangladesh are circulating as if they are from India. <image:14251>

The claim '<image:37> This image shows thousands gathering at Sohrawardi Park in Kolkata, India, in April 2025 to show solidarity with the Palestinian people amid the ongoing Israeli assault on Gaza.' is false.
Justification: The image depicts a protest in solidarity with the Palestinian people, but the location and date are not confirmed. While the image is associated with a protest in Kolkata, India, in solidarity with Palestine, the evidence from [Factly.in](https://factly.in/photos-of-a-protest-held-in-solidarity-with-palestine-in-dhaka-bangladesh-are-falsely-shared-as-those-from-kolkata/) and [kashif.ps](https://kashif.ps/en/index.php/2025/04/14/images-of-demonstration-in-solidarity-with-palestine-from-bangladesh-circulate-as-from-india/) suggests that images from Bangladesh are circulating as if they are from India, and the date of the event is not confirmed.

So, the overall veracity is: false
