```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
Al-Monitor reports on an Israeli strike on Houthi targets in Yemen, one day after a drone attack on Tel Aviv, with an image of a fire ![image 14348](media/2025-09-01_09-28-1756718939-995538.jpg). Al Jazeera published an article on July 21, 2024, discussing the US foreign policy failures against the Houthis, including an image of explosions ![image 14349](media/2025-09-01_09-29-1756718940-525162.jpg). The search results do not mention any attacks on the airport.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that there were attacks and explosions related to the Houthis around the time frame mentioned in the claim. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that the image shows Israelis fleeing the airport after a Houthi attack.

Therefore, the claim is unverified.


## Final Judgement
The image shows a crowded airport in Israel, but there is no evidence to support the claim that it depicts Israelis fleeing after a Houthi attack on July 19, 2024. The search results show attacks and explosions related to the Houthis, but not at the airport.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image depicts a crowded airport in Israel, but there is no evidence to support the claim that it shows Israelis fleeing after a Houthi attack on July 19, 2024. While there were attacks and explosions related to the Houthis around that time, the search results do not mention any attacks on the airport. Therefore, the claim is unverified.
