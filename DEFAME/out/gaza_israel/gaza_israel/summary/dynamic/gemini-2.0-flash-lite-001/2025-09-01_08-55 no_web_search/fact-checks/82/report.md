## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The web sources include articles about Bezalel Smotrich, the Israeli Finance Minister. One article from Le Monde features a photograph of Smotrich ([https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2023/11/06/bezalel-smotrich-israel-s-agent-of-chaos_6231784_4.html](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2023/11/06/bezalel-smotrich-israel-s-agent-of-chaos_6231784_4.html)). ![image 7348](media/2025-08-29_21-22-1756502567-277758.jpg)

The New York Times published an article on June 29, 2024, about Smotrich ([https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/29/world/middleeast/israel-funds-palestinian-authority-smotrich.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/29/world/middleeast/israel-funds-palestinian-authority-smotrich.html)). ![image 7349](media/2025-08-29_21-22-1756502567-487652.jpg) Bloomberg also shows a picture of Smotrich ([https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-09/israel-s-smotrich-says-trump-offers-chance-to-overthrow-iran](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-09/israel-s-smotrich-says-trump-offers-chance-to-overthrow-iran)). ![image 7351](media/2025-08-29_21-22-1756502567-789209.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Bezalel Smotrich is the Israeli Finance Minister. However, the search results do not provide any information about the context of the image in the claim, specifically whether it depicts Smotrich in a bomb shelter during a Hezbollah attack on August 25, 2024.

The provided evidence includes articles and images of Smotrich, but none of them are related to the claim's specific scenario. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available information.

To verify the claim, information about the image's context, including the date and location, is needed.

## Elaboration
The new evidence from the image search provides an article from The New York Times about the conflict between Israel and Lebanon. However, the article does not contain the image from the claim, nor does it mention Bezalel Smotrich or a bomb shelter.

The evidence does not provide any information to verify the claim.

To verify the claim, information about the image's context, including the date, location, and the presence of Smotrich in a bomb shelter during a Hezbollah attack, is still needed.
