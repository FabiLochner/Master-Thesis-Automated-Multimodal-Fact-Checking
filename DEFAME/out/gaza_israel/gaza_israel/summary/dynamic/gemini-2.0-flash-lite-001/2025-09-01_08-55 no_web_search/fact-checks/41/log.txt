The claim 'In March 2025, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents arrested and detained Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil, a lawful permanent resident of the U.S.' is false.
Justification: The claim is partially supported. Multiple sources confirm that Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist, was arrested by ICE in March 2025. However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that he was a lawful permanent resident of the U.S. The fact that an immigration judge ruled that he can be deported suggests that his permanent resident status is in question.

So, the overall veracity is: false
