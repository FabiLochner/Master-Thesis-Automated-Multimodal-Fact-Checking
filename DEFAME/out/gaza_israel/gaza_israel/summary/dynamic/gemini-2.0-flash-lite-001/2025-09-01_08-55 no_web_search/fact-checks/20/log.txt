Content: Al Jazeera published an article on January 30, 2025, stating that President Trump said his administration stopped a $50m plan to send condoms to Gaza. However, according to the United States Department of Health and Human Services, $83m was sent to two provinces in Mozambique, including one called Gaza, more than 6,000km (3,700 miles) away - not to Palestine. <image:6967>

The claim '$50 Million in US taxpayer money almost went to fund condoms in Gaza before DOGE cut it.' is false.
Justification: The claim is misleading. While there was a plan involving US taxpayer money and condoms, the funds were intended for a province in Mozambique also named Gaza, not the Gaza Strip, as reported by Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/30/is-the-us-sending-50m-in-condoms-to-gaza-as-trump-claims](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/30/is-the-us-sending-50m-in-condoms-to-gaza-as-trump-claims)). Additionally, the role of DOGE in halting the payment is unclear, as mentioned by Kfoxtv.com ([https://kfoxtv.com/news/nation-world/doge-halts-50-million-payment-for-condoms-in-gaza-white-house-says-hamas-israel-trump-administration-government-efficiency-karoline-leavitt](https://kfoxtv.com/news/nation-world/doge-halts-50-million-payment-for-condoms-in-gaza-white-house-says-hamas-israel-trump-administration-government-efficiency-karoline-leavitt)).

So, the overall veracity is: false
