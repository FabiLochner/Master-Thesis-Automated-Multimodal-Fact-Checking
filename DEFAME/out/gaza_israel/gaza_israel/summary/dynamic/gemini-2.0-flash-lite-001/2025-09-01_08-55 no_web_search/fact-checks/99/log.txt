Useful result: From [Source](https://metro.co.uk/2023/03/07/dog-bit-womans-nose-off-because-it-was-startled-by-teeth-whitening-18397588/):

The claim '<image:65> This is an authentic image of an elderly Palestinian women being attacked by an Israeli army dog in June 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is unverified. While there is evidence of Israeli military dogs attacking Palestinian women, and the image appears to be a digital artwork, the reverse image search and subsequent searches did not provide any information about the specific image in the claim. Therefore, the authenticity of the image cannot be confirmed.

So, the overall veracity is: false
