Useful result: From [Source](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-08-25/air-strike-inside-lebanon-israel-says/104267610):

The claim 'Commander of the Israeli Air Force, Major General Tomer Bar has been killed by Hеzbollаh in Tel Aviv in a drone attack in November 2024.' is false.
Justification: The fact-check reveals that while Major General Tomer Bar exists and there have been reports of attacks in Tel Aviv, there is no evidence to support the claim that he was killed in a drone attack in November 2024. The search results from sources like [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/7/hezbollah-attack-drones-target-tel-aviv-army-base-as-israel-pounds-lebanon) and [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/19/middleeast/israel-tel-aviv-explosion-us-embassy-intl-hnk) confirm attacks but do not mention his death.

So, the overall veracity is: false
