## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image in the claim (![image 20](media/27.jpg)) appears in a Vanity Fair article discussing anti-Semitism in France, specifically a 2014 pro-Palestinian demonstration in Paris where a swastika was painted on a statue. The article is available at [https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/07/anti-semitism-france-hostage-hyper-cacher-kosher-market](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/07/anti-semitism-france-hostage-hyper-cacher-kosher-market).

The same image (![image 6999](media/2025-08-29_21-13-1756502002-063306.jpg)) is also found in an article on the World Jewish Congress website about a German TV documentary on European anti-Semitism, published on June 19, 2017, and in an article by Adam Milstein in The Jerusalem Post on July 27, 2023, discussing antisemitism in Europe.

Bloomberg ([https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-10/french-far-right-parties-edge-toward-coalition-against-macron](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-10/french-far-right-parties-edge-toward-coalition-against-macron)) reports on the French far-right parties and their coalition against Macron, featuring an image of Marine Le Pen ![image 14111](media/2025-09-01_09-05-1756717508-832098.jpg).

Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/france-shifts-left-risk-policy-paralysis-looms-2024-07-08/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/france-shifts-left-risk-policy-paralysis-looms-2024-07-08/)) also published an article about the French parliamentary elections in 2024, including an image of a protest ![image 14112](media/2025-09-01_09-05-1756717509-654191.jpg).


## Elaboration
The image in the claim (![image 20](media/27.jpg)

## Final Judgement
The image in the claim is from a 2014 pro-Palestinian demonstration in Paris, not a 2024 protest against Le Pen's victory. The image has been taken out of context and misrepresented.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image in the claim is from a 2014 pro-Palestinian demonstration in Paris, as evidenced by a Vanity Fair article ([https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/07/anti-semitism-france-hostage-hyper-cacher-kosher-market](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/07/anti-semitism-france-hostage-hyper-cacher-kosher-market)). This contradicts the claim that it depicts a 2024 protest against Le Pen's victory.
