The claim '<image:62> This image shows a man from Gaza holding the hand of his son killed in an Israeli bombing in July, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The image in the claim is of Mesut Hancer holding the hand of his daughter, who died in the February 2023 earthquake in Turkey, as reported by sources like *The Independent* ([https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/turkey-earthquake-father-daughter-hold-hands-b2277655.html](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/turkey-earthquake-father-daughter-hold-hands-b2277655.html)). The claim incorrectly states the image is from Gaza and related to a bombing in July 2024.

So, the overall veracity is: false
