The claim '<image:40> This image shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in March 2025 signing Israeli bombs intended for use against Palestinians in Gaza.' is false.
Justification: The image depicts Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing ammunition at a plant in Scranton, Pennsylvania, in September 2024, not Israeli bombs intended for use against Palestinians in Gaza, as the claim suggests. This is supported by articles from the BBC News and Associated Press, which document the event and do not mention Israeli bombs or Gaza.
