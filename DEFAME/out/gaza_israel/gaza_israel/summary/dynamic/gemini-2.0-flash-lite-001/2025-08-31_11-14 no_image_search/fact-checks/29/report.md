## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the IHRA working definition of antisemitism was adopted in 2016. The search results do not mention any amendments to the definition in March 2025 or the inclusion of "Conflating the assassination of JFK to jews/israel." Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the provided information.
