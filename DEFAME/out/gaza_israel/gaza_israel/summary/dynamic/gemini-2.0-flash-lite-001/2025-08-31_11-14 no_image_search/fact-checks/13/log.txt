The claim '<image:11> This image shows a US factility come under attack in Baghdad on September 30, 2024 as the conflict between Israel and the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah escalated.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not supported by the evidence. While there were attacks in Baghdad on September 30, 2024, and the Israel-Hezbollah conflict was ongoing, the image's geolocation does not indicate it was taken in Baghdad.

So, the overall veracity is: false
