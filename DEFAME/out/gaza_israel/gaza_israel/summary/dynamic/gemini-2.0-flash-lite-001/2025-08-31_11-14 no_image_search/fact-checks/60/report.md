## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image ![image 35](media/60.jpg)

### Evidence from `web_search`
The CNN article ([https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk)) discusses the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, including attacks in Lebanon on October 21, 2024. The article mentions an explosion in Beirut and an Israeli strike near Rafik Hariri University Hospital. The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Israeli_invasion_of_Lebanon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Israeli_invasion_of_Lebanon)) discusses the 2024 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, which began on October 1, 2024, and mentions military engagements, airstrikes, and attacks, including those on October 21, 2024.

The Guardian article ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/21/israeli-airstrikes-on-lebanon-hit-branches-of-hezbollah-linked-bank-al-qard-al-hassan](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/21/israeli-airstrikes-on-lebanon-hit-branches-of-hezbollah-linked-bank-al-qard-al-hassan)) reports on Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon on October 21, 2024, targeting branches of the Hezbollah-linked bank Al-Qard Al-Hassan. The image ![image 35](media/60.jpg)

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that there were Israeli attacks on Lebanon on October 21, 2024. The CNN article ([https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk)) and The Guardian article ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/21/israeli-airstrikes-on-lebanon-hit-branches-of-hezbollah-linked-bank-al-qard-al-hassan](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/21/israeli-airstrikes-on-lebanon-hit-branches-of-hezbollah-linked-bank-al-qard-al-hassan)) both support this.

However, the evidence does not provide information about the image itself. Therefore, I cannot verify if the image depicts an Israeli attack on Lebanon on October 21, 2024.

I need more information to verify the claim.


## Actions
```
geolocate(![image 35](media/60.jpg))
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.66, 'Israel': 0.22, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.08, 'Jordan': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0, 'Austria': 0.0, 'Bangladesh': 0.0}

## Elaboration
The evidence from the web search confirms that there were Israeli attacks on Lebanon on October 21, 2024. The geolocation of the image suggests that it was most likely taken in Palestine.

However, the evidence does not confirm that the image depicts an Israeli attack on Lebanon.

Insufficient information to verify the claim.

## Final Judgement
The claim is about an image depicting an Israeli attack on Lebanon on October 21, 2024. The evidence confirms that there were Israeli attacks on Lebanon on October 21, 2024. The image is credited to MAHMUD HAMS, a photographer who has documented events in Gaza. However, the evidence does not confirm that the image depicts an Israeli attack on Lebanon. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim cannot be verified. While there is evidence of Israeli attacks on Lebanon on October 21, 2024, and the image is credited to MAHMUD HAMS, a photographer who has documented events in Gaza, there is no direct evidence to confirm that the image depicts an Israeli attack on Lebanon on the specified date.
