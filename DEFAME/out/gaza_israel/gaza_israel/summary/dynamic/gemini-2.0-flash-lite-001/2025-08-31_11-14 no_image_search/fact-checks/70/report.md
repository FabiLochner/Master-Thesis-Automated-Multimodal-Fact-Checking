## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
PBS News Hour reported on October 2, 2024, that Israel's air-defense system intercepted projectiles fired from Iran, with the Iron Dome having a success rate of over 90% during the attack. The article mentions that Iran fired over 180 missiles. ([https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/israels-air-defense-system-passes-test-in-fending-off-iranian-missile-strike](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/israels-air-defense-system-passes-test-in-fending-off-iranian-missile-strike)) ![image 227](media/2025-07-18_13-33-1752845601-203165.jpg)

An Associated Press article published on June 19, 2025, discusses the Iranian missile strikes on Israel, noting that the Iron Dome is not foolproof, and enemy missiles can penetrate, despite generally high interception rates.

## Elaboration
The PBS News Hour article states that the Iron Dome had a success rate of over 90% during the attack on October 1, 2024, which aligns with the claim. The article also mentions that Iran fired over 180 missiles.

The Associated Press article from June 19, 2025, confirms that the Iron Dome is not foolproof, and some missiles can penetrate the defense system. However, this article does not provide specific interception rates for the October 1, 2024, attack.

Based on the evidence, the claim is likely true.


## Final Judgement
The evidence from PBS News Hour supports the claim that the Iron Dome intercepted over 90% of the projectiles fired from Iran during the October 1, 2024, attack. The Associated Press article confirms that the Iron Dome is not perfect, but it does not contradict the claim.

`true`

### Verdict: TRUE

### Justification
The claim is supported by a PBS News Hour article stating that the Iron Dome had a success rate of over 90% during the attack on October 1, 2024, when Iran fired projectiles at Israel ([https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/israels-air-defense-system-passes-test-in-fending-off-iranian-missile-strike](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/israels-air-defense-system-passes-test-in-fending-off-iranian-missile-strike)).
