Useful result: From [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/16/israel-vows-to-kill-houthi-leader-after-striking-yemeni-ports): Found exact image on website with title: Israel launches strikes on two Yemen ports | Houthis News
Content: Al Jazeera published an article on May 16, 2025, reporting on Israeli strikes on Yemeni ports. <image:i>. The strikes were in response to Houthi missile attacks towards Israel, which occurred after a U.S.-Houthi ceasefire deal. The article mentions a ceasefire deal between the U.S. and the Houthis, where the Houthis agreed to end attacks on shipping lanes in the Red Sea. Israel was not included in this agreement.

The claim 'The Huthi rebels announced the final cessation of their military operations in international waters after Trump won the 2024 US presidential election.' is false.
Justification: The claim is partially false. While a U.S.-Houthi ceasefire was announced by Trump in May 2025, where the Houthis agreed to stop attacking U.S. vessels, it did not represent a complete cessation of military operations. The Houthis continued other military actions, such as missile attacks towards Israel, after the ceasefire, as reported by [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/16/israel-vows-to-kill-houthi-leader-after-striking-yemeni-ports).

So, the overall veracity is: false
