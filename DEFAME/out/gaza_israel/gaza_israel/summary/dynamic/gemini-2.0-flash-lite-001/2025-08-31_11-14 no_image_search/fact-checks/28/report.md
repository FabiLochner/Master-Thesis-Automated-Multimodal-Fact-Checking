## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
On April 2, 2025, the Ethiopian News Agency ([https://www.ena.et/web/eng/w/eng_6302848](https://www.ena.et/web/eng/w/eng_6302848)) reported that the Israeli Ambassador to Ethiopia, Abraham Negussie, expressed Israel's commitment to strengthening ties with Ethiopia ![image 1](media/0.jpg). Fana Media Corporation S.C. ([https://www.fanamc.com/english/israel-seeks-stronger-economic-people-ties-with-ethiopia-ambassador/](https://www.fanamc.com/english/israel-seeks-stronger-economic-people-ties-with-ethiopia-ambassador/)) also reported on the same day that the ambassador emphasized the commitment to strengthening ties ![image 5051](media/2025-08-23_01-29-1755912546-305304.jpg).

The Wikipedia article "Ethiopiaâ€“Israel relations" ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia%E2%80%93Israel_relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia%E2%80%93Israel_relations)) discusses the diplomatic relations between the two countries, including the history of their relationship <image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that on April 2, 2025, the Israeli Ambassador to Ethiopia, Abraham Negussie, was actively working to strengthen ties between the two countries. This directly contradicts the claim that Ethiopia expelled the ambassador in April 2025.

The Ethiopian News Agency ([https://www.ena.et/web/eng/w/eng_6302848](https://www.ena.et/web/eng/w/eng_6302848)) and Fana Media Corporation S.C. ([https://www.fanamc.com/english/israel-seeks-stronger-economic-people-ties-with-ethiopia-ambassador/](https://www.fanamc.com/english/israel-seeks-stronger-economic-people-ties-with-ethiopia-ambassador/)) both reported on the ambassador's activities on that date.


## Final Judgement
The evidence from multiple sources, including the Ethiopian News Agency and Fana Media Corporation, indicates that the Israeli ambassador to Ethiopia was actively engaged in strengthening ties with Ethiopia in April 2025. This contradicts the claim that the ambassador was expelled.
