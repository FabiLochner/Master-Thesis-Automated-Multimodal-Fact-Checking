## Final Judgement
The image in the claim has been identified as fabricated. The original photo was taken in 2009 and shows Benjamin Netanyahu with his father. The claim that the image was captured and published by Hezbollah in August 2024 is therefore false.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image in the claim is fabricated, as confirmed by a reverse image search ([Source](https://pesacheck.org/altered-this-photo-of-a-drone-surveilling-pm-netanyahu-is-fabricated-396f43e817da)). The original photo was taken in 2009 and has been altered to depict surveillance of Benjamin Netanyahu. While there were reports of Hezbollah activity, including a suspected drone filming of Netanyahu's home in August 2024 and a claimed drone attack in October 2024, the image itself is not authentic.
