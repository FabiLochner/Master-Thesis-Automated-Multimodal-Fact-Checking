The claim '<image:60> This image shows Israelis fleeing the airport after the Houthis attack on July 19, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The image depicts Ben Gurion Airport in Israel, but the claim that it shows Israelis fleeing after a Houthi attack on July 19, 2024, is false. The image was taken on August 8, 2025, and was also used in an article from October 10, 2023, and there is no evidence of a Houthi attack on the specified date.
