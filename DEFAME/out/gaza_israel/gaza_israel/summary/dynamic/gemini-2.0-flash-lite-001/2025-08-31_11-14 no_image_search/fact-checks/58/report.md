## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) published a report on December 10, 2024, regarding the reported impact snapshot in the Gaza Strip ([https://www.ochaopt.org/content/reported-impact-snapshot-gaza-strip-10-december-2024](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/reported-impact-snapshot-gaza-strip-10-december-2024)). Human Rights Watch published a report on December 19, 2024, discussing the destruction in Gaza, mentioning that 80 percent of buildings in northern Gaza had been damaged or destroyed as of December 2023, and 1.9 million people were displaced as of November 2024. The report also includes a photograph of a destroyed solar panel field ![image 1](media/0.jpg).

The Reliefweb report, "Occupied Palestinian Territory (oPt) - Gaza Protection Analysis Update, December 2024," discusses the ongoing protection and human rights crisis in Gaza, including the closure of the Rafah crossing, intensified Israeli operations, and the impact of the ongoing hostilities, including violence, death, injury, deprivation, starvation, and disease. The report also mentions the killing of over 1,040 medical personnel ![image 1](media/0.jpg).


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates significant destruction in Gaza in December 2024. Reports from OCHA and Human Rights Watch confirm widespread damage and displacement. The Human Rights Watch report states that 80% of buildings in northern Gaza were damaged or destroyed by December 2023, and 1.9 million people were displaced by November 2024. The Reliefweb report highlights the ongoing humanitarian crisis, including violence, death, injury, and deprivation.

While the evidence confirms substantial destruction, it does not explicitly state that Gaza was "completely destroyed" as the claim suggests. The reports detail widespread damage and a severe humanitarian crisis, but the extent of the destruction described in the claim is not fully supported by the evidence.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported, but the description of "completely destroyed" is not fully verified. More specific information about the extent of the damage is needed to fully verify the claim.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The UNOSAT published a damage assessment of the Gaza Strip based on satellite imagery collected on December 1, 2024, indicating that approximately 69% of the total structures have been damaged, corresponding to 245,123 damaged housing units ([https://data.humdata.org/dataset/unosat-gaza-strip-comprehensive-damage-assessment-01-december-2024](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/unosat-gaza-strip-comprehensive-damage-assessment-01-december-2024)). The World Bank, the European Union, and the United Nations estimated $18.5 billion in direct damages to infrastructure by the end of January 2024 ([https://thedocs.worldbank.org/en/doc/14e309cd34e04e40b90eb19afa7b5d15-0280012024/original/Gaza-Interim-Damage-Assessment-032924-Final.pdf](https://thedocs.worldbank.org/en/doc/14e309cd34e04e40b90eb19afa7b5d15-0280012024/original/Gaza-Interim-Damage-Assessment-032924-Final.pdf)). A UN News article from March 1, 2025, mentions that over 60% of homes and 65% of roads have been destroyed, with the cost of damage to physical infrastructure estimated at $30 billion ([https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/03/1160661](https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/03/1160661)). The article includes images of the destruction ![image 1](media/0.jpg), ![image 2](media/1.jpg), ![image 3](media/2.jpg).


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates extensive damage in Gaza in December 2024. The UNOSAT assessment from December 1, 2024, shows that approximately 69% of structures were damaged. The World Bank, the European Union, and the United Nations estimated $18.5 billion in direct damages to infrastructure by the end of January 2024. A UN News article from March 1, 2025, states that over 60% of homes and 65% of roads have been destroyed.

While the evidence confirms widespread destruction, it does not explicitly state that Gaza was "completely destroyed." The UNOSAT data and the UN News article provide specific percentages of damage, but they do not support the claim of complete destruction.

Therefore, the claim is not fully supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates significant damage in Gaza in December 2024, with reports of widespread destruction and displacement. However, the claim that Gaza was "completely destroyed" is not fully supported by the evidence, as the reports provide specific percentages of damage but do not indicate complete destruction.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is rated as false. While evidence from sources like the UNOSAT ([https://data.humdata.org/dataset/unosat-gaza-strip-comprehensive-damage-assessment-01-december-2024](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/unosat-gaza-strip-comprehensive-damage-assessment-01-december-2024)) and UN News articles ([https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/03/1160661](https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/03/1160661)) confirms extensive damage in Gaza in December 2024, with approximately 69% of structures damaged, the evidence does not support the assertion that Gaza was "completely destroyed."
