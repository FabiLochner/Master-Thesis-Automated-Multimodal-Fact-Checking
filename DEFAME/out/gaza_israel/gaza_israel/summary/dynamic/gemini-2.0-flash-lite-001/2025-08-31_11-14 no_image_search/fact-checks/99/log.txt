Useful result: From [Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-england-birmingham-66664799): 
Content: The BBC News article from August 30, 2023, reports on a dog attack in Handsworth, Birmingham, where a 76-year-old woman and her labradoodle were attacked by a bull terrier type breed. The woman was injured and spent four days in the hospital. <image:12444>

The claim '<image:65> This is an authentic image of an elderly Palestinian women being attacked by an Israeli army dog in June 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While there are reports of Israeli army dogs attacking Palestinian women ([https://www.alhaq.org/monitoring-documentation/6941.html](https://www.alhaq.org/monitoring-documentation/6941.html), [https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israeli-army-dog-mauled-palestinian-pregnant-woman-then-she-lost-baby](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israeli-army-dog-mauled-palestinian-pregnant-woman-then-she-lost-baby)), the image is likely a digital artwork or a staged photograph, and the provided evidence does not confirm its authenticity or the specific details of the claim.

So, the overall veracity is: false
