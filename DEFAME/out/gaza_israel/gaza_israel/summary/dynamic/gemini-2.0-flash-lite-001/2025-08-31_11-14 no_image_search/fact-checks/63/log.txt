Useful result: From [Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67614139): 
Content: The BBC News article, published on December 4, 2023, discusses the plight of children in Gaza who have lost their families due to the conflict. It mentions the acronym "WCNSF" (wounded child, no surviving family) used by medics. The article includes images of injured children and discusses the challenges of identifying and caring for orphaned children in the region. <image:12227>, <image:12228>, <image:12230>.

The claim '<image:38> This image shows two children in Gaza in April 2025 found dead under the rubble of their home two months after an Israeli airstrike destroyed it.' is false.
Justification: The image in the claim is misattributed. Reverse image search reveals that the image depicts mummified children from a Bolivian museum, not children found in Gaza as claimed, as reported by [Kashif.ps](https://kashif.ps/en/index.php/2025/04/14/image-of-two-mummified-children-in-a-bolivian-museum-goes-viral-as-from-gaza/).
