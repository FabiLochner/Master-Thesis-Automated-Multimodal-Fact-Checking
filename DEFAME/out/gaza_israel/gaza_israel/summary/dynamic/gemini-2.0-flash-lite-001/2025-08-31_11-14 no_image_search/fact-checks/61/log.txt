Useful result: From [Source](https://www.gettyimages.co.uk/detail/news-photo/woman-walks-past-clothes-drying-on-a-cars-roof-rack-in-news-photo/1994925935): 
Content: The search result from Getty Images shows a photograph taken on February 11, 2024, in Rafah, Gaza Strip, of a woman walking past clothes drying on a car's roof rack. <image:i> The photo was taken by Mohammed Abed for AFP.

The claim '<image:36> This image shows a Palestinian woman using an Israeli tank to dry clothes in Gaza in July 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not supported by the evidence. While there are reports of Israeli tanks in Gaza and images of people drying clothes in Gaza, there is no evidence to support the specific claim of a Palestinian woman using an Israeli tank to dry clothes. The reverse image search and web searches did not yield any matching images or information.

So, the overall veracity is: false
