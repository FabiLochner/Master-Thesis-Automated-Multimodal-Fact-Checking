Content: The search result from Doctors Without Borders (MSF) discusses a survey of MSF staff and their families in Gaza, which found that almost half of those killed in the war were children. The article mentions a photo of an MSF surgeon helping his son put on an oxygen mask in Al-Shifa Hospital after being injured in an airstrike in Gaza city in 2025. <image:k> The article was published on July 9, 2025.

The claim '<image:61> This image shows a Palestinian girl in the Gaza war in July 2024. She was holding her sister's oxygen mask inside the ambulance. She had already passed away, yet her hand remained on the mask firmly.' is false.
Justification: The image in the claim is not from the Gaza war in July 2024. Reverse image searches reveal that the image is from Syria and dates back to January 2018, associated with a reported gas attack in Douma, Syria ([https://www.voanews.com/a/syria-russia-us-chemical-attacks/4221637.html](https://www.voanews.com/a/syria-russia-us-chemical-attacks/4221637.html)).
