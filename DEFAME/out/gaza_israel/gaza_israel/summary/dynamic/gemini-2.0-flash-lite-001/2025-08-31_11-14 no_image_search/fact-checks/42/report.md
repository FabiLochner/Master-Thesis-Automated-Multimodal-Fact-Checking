## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
On January 7, 2025, NPR reported that President-elect Donald Trump said during a news conference at Mar-a-Lago that "all hell will break out" if Hamas does not release hostages by the time he takes office (![image 67](media/2025-07-18_13-25-1752845134-711302.jpg), ![image 68](media/2025-07-18_13-25-1752845135-244023.jpg), ![image 69](media/2025-07-18_13-25-1752845137-337491.jpg)). CNN also reported on the same day that Trump warned that if the hostages whom Hamas is still holding in Gaza are not released by his inauguration on January 20, “all hell will break out in the Middle East” (<image:k>).

Reuters published an article on January 7, 2025, mentioning Trump's statement that there would be "hell to pay" if the hostages were not freed by his inauguration (![image 71](media/2025-07-18_13-26-1752845165-567006.jpg)).
