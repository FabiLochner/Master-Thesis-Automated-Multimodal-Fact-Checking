## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image ![image 59](media/92.jpg)

### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources discuss Israeli airstrikes in Gaza during July 2024. One source, a Wikipedia article, details the 13 July 2024 al-Mawasi attack, which resulted in numerous casualties and international condemnation. Another source, a CNN article, reports on an airstrike on a school in Deir-al Balah, central Gaza, resulting in at least 30 deaths. An NPR article also reports on an Israeli airstrike on a school in Gaza being used as a shelter, resulting in at least 30 deaths, including children. ![image 59](media/92.jpg)

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that there were Israeli airstrikes in Gaza in July 2024. The search results mention attacks that resulted in casualties, including children. However, the evidence does not provide information about the specific image or its context.

To verify the claim, I need to know if the image is related to any of the events mentioned in the search results. I also need to confirm the child's identity and the circumstances surrounding the image.

Insufficient information to verify the claim.
