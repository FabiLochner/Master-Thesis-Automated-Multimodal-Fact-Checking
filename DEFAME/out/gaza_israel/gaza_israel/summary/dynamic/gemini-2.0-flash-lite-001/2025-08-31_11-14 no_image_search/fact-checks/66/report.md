## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing ammunition. The BBC published articles on September 26, 2024, discussing Zelensky's meeting with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, and his visit to an ammunition factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania, where he signed ammunition (![image 1958](media/2025-07-20_10-54-1753008879-003048.jpg), ![image 1964](media/2025-07-20_10-54-1753008881-965155.jpg)). The Associated Press reported that Zelenskyy visited the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant to thank workers producing munitions for Ukraine, and that House Speaker Mike Johnson is demanding Zelenskyy remove Ukraine’s ambassador to the U.S. after the visit (![image 40](media/66.jpg)). The articles do not mention Israeli bombs or Palestinians in Gaza.

### Evidence from `web_search`
The image shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing artillery shells. According to Eurovision News | Spotlight, the video and images were falsely claimed to show Zelenskyy signing shells for use in Gaza by Israel. The video actually shows Zelenskyy at a U.S. factory supporting Ukraine's defense needs, where he wrote "Glory to Ukraine" and "Thanks for Support" on the shells, referencing Ukraine’s war with Russia. The Fox News article mentions that Zelenskyy signed a missile alongside Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro at the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant (SCAAP). The Caliber.Az article also mentions Zelenskyy signing munitions with messages of gratitude, including "Glory to Ukraine." ![image 40](media/66.jpg)


## Elaboration
The claim is false. The image shows Zelenskyy signing artillery shells at a U.S. factory, not Israeli bombs. The shells were intended for Ukraine's defense against Russia, not for use against Palestinians in Gaza. The event took place in September 2024, not March 2025.


## Final Judgement
The image depicts Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing artillery shells at a U.S. factory in September 2024, intended for Ukraine's defense against Russia. The claim misrepresents the context, stating the shells were Israeli bombs for use against Palestinians in Gaza in March 2025. This is a clear misrepresentation of the event.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing artillery shells at a U.S. factory in September 2024, as reported by the [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c80rkv0k4j8o) and the [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/zelenskyy-johnson-ambassador-ukraine-biden-harris-trump-d81b0a055d99cfd4804b3f2c00915d09). The shells were for Ukraine's defense against Russia, not Israeli bombs for use in Gaza, as falsely claimed by the post.
