Fox LA reports that the star was vandalized with the words "baby killer" and a sticker that read "Israeli snipers target children" (![image 12004](media/2025-08-31_11-29-1756639796-776076.jpg)). The Jerusalem Post and Jewish News Syndicate (JNS) also reported the vandalism, with JNS mentioning that the vandalism was removed by Israelis living in Los Angeles (![image 15](media/18.jpg)).

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Gal Gadot's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame was vandalized. The vandalism included the words "baby killer" and a sticker. The image in the claim shows a star that has been damaged, which is consistent with the vandalism reported in the evidence. The evidence does not mention the star being destroyed hours after being placed, nor does it mention the year 2025.

Based on the evidence, the claim is partially accurate. The star was vandalized, but the claim's details about the timing and extent of the damage are not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The image shows a vandalized star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, which is consistent with reports of vandalism on Gal Gadot's star. However, the claim that the star was destroyed hours after being placed in March 2025 is not supported by the evidence.
