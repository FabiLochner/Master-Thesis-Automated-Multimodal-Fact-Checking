Useful result: From [Source](https://newrepublic.com/post/185076/donald-trump-scheme-beat-kamala-harris-benjamin-netanyahu-ceasefire): 
Content: The New Republic reports that Donald Trump allegedly spoke with Benjamin Netanyahu to avert a ceasefire deal, fearing it would help Kamala Harris win in November, according to PBS. The article also mentions that both Netanyahu's office and Trump denied the report.

The claim 'In a phone call with Benjamin Netanyahu on August 14, 2024, Donald Trump told the Israeli prime minister to stop a Gaza ceasefire deal because it would help Vice President Kamala Harris' 2024 presidential campaign.' is false.
Justification: The claim is disputed. While there are reports of a phone call between Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu on August 14, 2024, the details are inconsistent. Some sources, like Reuters, suggest Trump encouraged a ceasefire, while others, such as Newsweek, allege Trump urged Netanyahu to avoid a deal to hinder Kamala Harris's campaign. Both Trump and Netanyahu denied the call, making the claim's veracity uncertain.

So, the overall veracity is: false
