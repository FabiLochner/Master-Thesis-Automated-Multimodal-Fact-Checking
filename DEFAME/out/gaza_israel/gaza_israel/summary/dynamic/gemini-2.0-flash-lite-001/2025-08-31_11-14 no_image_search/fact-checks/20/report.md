## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Al Jazeera published an article on January 30, 2025, discussing Donald Trump's claim that $50 million in US taxpayer money was going to fund condoms in Gaza, stating there is no public evidence to support this claim. The International Medical Corps (IMC) stated that no US government funding was used to procure or distribute condoms in Gaza. CNN published an article on January 29, 2025, fact-checking the claim, stating that the White House offered no evidence for the story. The article also mentions that in three previous years under Biden, USAID spent no money on condoms in the entire Middle East.

Anadolu Agency reports that Elon Musk backtracked on the claim that the US intended to send $50 million worth of condoms to Gaza. The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) grants database shows that the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation in Mozambique received more than $83 million in funding since 2021 for reproductive health projects in two provinces: Inhambane and Gaza.

## Elaboration
The claim that $50 million in US taxpayer money was going to fund condoms in Gaza is not supported by the evidence. Multiple sources, including Al Jazeera and CNN, state there is no public evidence to support this claim. The International Medical Corps (IMC) also denied using US government funding for condoms in Gaza. Furthermore, Elon Musk retracted the claim.

The evidence does mention that the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation received over $83 million for reproductive health projects in Mozambique, but this is unrelated to the claim about Gaza.


## Final Judgement
The available evidence strongly contradicts the claim. Multiple sources, including news outlets like Al Jazeera and CNN, report that there is no evidence to support the claim that $50 million in US taxpayer money was allocated for condoms in Gaza. Furthermore, the claim was retracted by Elon Musk.
