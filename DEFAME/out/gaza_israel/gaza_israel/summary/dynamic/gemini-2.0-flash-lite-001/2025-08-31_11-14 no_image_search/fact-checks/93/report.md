## Actions
```
geolocate(![image 60](media/93.jpg))
web_search("airport crowded israel")
reverse_search(![image 60](media/93.jpg))
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.89, 'Palestine': 0.06, 'Jordan': 0.01, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0, 'Austria': 0.0, 'Bangladesh': 0.0}

### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources discuss the high volume of passengers at Ben Gurion Airport. One article from Ynetnews.com mentions the busiest day of summer, with 78,000 passengers expected. The Times of Israel reports that Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv was expected to record the busiest day since the war with Hamas on October 7, 2023. The image (![image 60](media/93.jpg)) shows passengers at Ben Gurion International airport near Tel Aviv, August 8, 2025.

### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image in the claim (![image 60](media/93.jpg)) appears in a Business Insider article from October 10, 2023, which discusses flight cancellations and chaos at Israel's Ben Gurion Airport during the war with Gaza. The image is also found on Getty Images, which contains stock photos of Ben Gurion Airport, including images of crowded areas, flight cancellations, and security measures. Some images are dated from 2022, 2023, 2024, and 2025. The Getty Images search results include images of the airport after attacks or during times of tension.


## Elaboration
The claim is not supported by the evidence. The image is of Ben Gurion Airport in Israel. However, the evidence indicates that the image was taken on August 8, 2025, and the image was also used in an article from October 10, 2023. The evidence does not mention any attacks by Houthis on July 19, 2024.


## Final Judgement
The image is of Ben Gurion Airport in Israel. The image was taken on August 8, 2025, and was also used in an article from October 10, 2023. The evidence does not mention any attacks by Houthis on July 19, 2024.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image depicts Ben Gurion Airport in Israel, but the claim that it shows Israelis fleeing after a Houthi attack on July 19, 2024, is false. The image was taken on August 8, 2025, and was also used in an article from October 10, 2023, and there is no evidence of a Houthi attack on the specified date.
