## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Jerusalem Post published an article on June 30, 2025, stating that a Mossad-linked X account denied rumors of ties to Iranian General Esmail Qaani. [![image 1](media/0.jpg)] The Anadolu Agency reported on June 25, 2025, that Esmail Qaani appeared in Tehran during celebrations, contradicting earlier reports of his assassination. [<image:k>] An IranWire article from October 7, 2024, reported that there was no news regarding Qaani's whereabouts in recent days, with his last known location being in Lebanon on September 29, 2024.

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the claim is likely false. The Jerusalem Post reported a denial from a Mossad-linked account regarding ties to Qaani. Furthermore, the Anadolu Agency reported Qaani's appearance in Tehran in June 2025, contradicting the claim of him fleeing in April 2025. An IranWire article from October 2024 also indicates that Qaani was last known to be in Lebanon in September 2024.

The evidence directly contradicts the claim that Qaani fled to Israel in April 2025.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that the claim is false. Multiple sources, including The Jerusalem Post and Anadolu Agency, provide information that contradicts the claim. The Jerusalem Post reported a denial of ties to Qaani, and the Anadolu Agency reported his presence in Tehran, which contradicts the claim of him fleeing to Israel.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. Evidence from the Jerusalem Post indicates a denial of ties to Qaani, and the Anadolu Agency reported his presence in Tehran in June 2025, contradicting the claim that he fled to Israel in April 2025. An IranWire article also indicates his last known location was in Lebanon in September 2024.
