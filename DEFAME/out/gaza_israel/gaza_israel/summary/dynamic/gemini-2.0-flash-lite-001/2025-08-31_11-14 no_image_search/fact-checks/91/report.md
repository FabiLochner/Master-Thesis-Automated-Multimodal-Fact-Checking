### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources discuss a Houthi attack on Tel Aviv, Israel. One source, from Wikipedia, details a drone attack on July 19, 2024, that targeted an apartment building, resulting in one death and ten injuries. The Houthi movement claimed responsibility, and the drone was not intercepted due to human error. The article includes the image ![image 58](media/91.jpg).

Reuters reports that a long-range Iranian-made drone hit Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024, in an attack claimed by the Yemen-based Houthi militia, which killed one man and wounded four others. The article includes a photograph of a damaged building ![image 131](media/2025-07-18_13-28-1752845302-912611.jpg). The New York Times reports a missile attack in December 2024, which landed in a playground. The Houthis claimed the attack was to aid the Palestinian people.
