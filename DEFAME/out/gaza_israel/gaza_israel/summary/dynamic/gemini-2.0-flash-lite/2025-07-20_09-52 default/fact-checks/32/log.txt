Useful result: From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Iran%E2%80%93Israel_conflict): 
Content: The Wikipedia article on the 2024 Iran–Israel conflict mentions that on July 31, 2024, Fuad Shukr, a senior Hezbollah commander, was assassinated in an Israeli strike. The article also states that on the same day, Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of Hamas, was assassinated in Tehran. The article also mentions that on October 26, 2024, Israel began attacking Iran. The article does not mention Major General Tomer Bar.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-november-17-2024): 
Content: The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) reports on November 17, 2024, that the IDF Air Force commander Major General Tomer Bar visited Jabalia and conducted a situational assessment of the IDF’s ground and air campaigns in the northern Gaza Strip. The report does not mention any drone attacks on Tomer Bar or his death.

The claim 'Commander of the Israeli Air Force, Major General Tomer Bar has been killed by Hеzbollаh in Tel Aviv in a drone attack in November 2024.' is not enough information.
Justification: The claim cannot be verified. While multiple sources ([Press TV](https://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2024/11/27/738007/Lebanon-Hezbollah-residence-Tomer-Bar-attack-drones), [EFE](https://efe.com/en/latest-news/2024-11-27/israel-hezbollah-ceasefire-2/), and [Al Mayadeen](https://english.almayadeen.net/latestnews/2024/11/26/lebanese-resistance--on-18-november--one-of-critical-militar)) report that Hezbollah claimed to have attacked the residence of Israeli Air Force Commander Tomer Bar in Tel Aviv with a drone on November 18, 2024, none of the provided evidence confirms that he was killed in the attack. Furthermore, the sources mention Israeli censorship, which may explain the lack of information about the outcome of the attack.

So, the overall veracity is: not enough information
