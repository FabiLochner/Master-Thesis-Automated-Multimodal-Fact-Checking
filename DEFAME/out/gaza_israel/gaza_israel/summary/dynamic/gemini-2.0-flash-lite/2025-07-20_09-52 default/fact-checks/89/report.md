## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
According to a Wikipedia article, Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated on July 31, 2024, in Tehran, Iran, by an Israeli attack (<image:i>). The article also mentions that Israel's Defense Minister confirmed Israel's responsibility in the assassination in December 2024. The CNN article, updated August 1, 2024, reports that Haniyeh was killed in an Israeli strike in Tehran on July 31, 2024 (<image:i>).

The CNN article states that Israel has neither confirmed nor denied being behind the assassination.

### Evidence from `web_search`
CUFI discusses Hamas using WhatsApp to collect intelligence on IDF movements, and the IDF countering this activity. The Tehran Times published an article stating that Ismail Haniyeh's son said his father used WhatsApp before his assassination, which the article claims was carried out by the Israeli regime on July 31, 2024. ![image 1](media/0.jpg) Truthout reports that Israeli intelligence allegedly uses WhatsApp data to target Palestinians with an AI system. ![image 1](media/0.jpg)

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated on July 31, 2024, in Tehran, Iran, in an attack attributed to Israel. The Tehran Times reported that Haniyeh used WhatsApp before his assassination. Truthout reports that Israeli intelligence allegedly uses WhatsApp data to target Palestinians.

Based on the evidence, it is plausible that Israeli intelligence tracked Ismail Haniyeh through WhatsApp. However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that Israeli intelligence used WhatsApp to track Haniyeh specifically.

Therefore, the claim is likely true, but further evidence is needed to confirm the direct use of WhatsApp for tracking Haniyeh.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Jerusalem Post reported that an IRGC-affiliated media claimed Israel killed Ismail Haniyeh, and Iranian state media warned that Israel uses cell phone tracking to assassinate leaders (<image:i>). The Modern Diplomacy article suggests that Pegasus spyware could have been used to track Haniyeh's communications. Daraj.media states that an Iranian security source told The Atlantic that Israel used AI technology, including analyzing data from WhatsApp groups, to track Haniyeh.

## Elaboration
The new evidence strengthens the claim. The Jerusalem Post mentions that Iranian state media warned that Israel uses cell phone tracking to assassinate leaders. Daraj.media reports that an Iranian security source told The Atlantic that Israel used AI technology, including analyzing data from WhatsApp groups, to track Haniyeh.

The evidence suggests that Israel may have used WhatsApp data to track Haniyeh, supporting the claim.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated on July 31, 2024, and that Israel is suspected of being behind the attack. Furthermore, there are reports suggesting that Israeli intelligence uses cell phone tracking and AI, including analyzing data from WhatsApp, to target individuals. While there is no definitive proof that WhatsApp was used to track Haniyeh specifically, the available information supports the claim.

`true`


### Verdict: TRUE

### Justification
Based on the provided evidence, the claim is likely true. Multiple sources, including the Jerusalem Post and Daraj.media, suggest that Israel uses cell phone tracking and AI, including analyzing WhatsApp data, to target individuals. While there is no definitive proof that WhatsApp was used to track Ismail Haniyeh specifically, the available information supports the possibility, given his assassination on July 31, 2024, and the alleged involvement of Israeli intelligence.
