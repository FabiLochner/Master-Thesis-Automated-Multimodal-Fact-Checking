## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The image (![image 3](media/2.jpg)) of a woman holding a skeleton, purportedly in Gaza, is AI-generated. According to [news.abplive.com](https://news.abplive.com/fact-check/viral-image-of-gazan-woman-golding-child-s-remains-is-digitally-generated-1760363), the image was created by "in.visualart" using Photoshop and AI tools. PesaCheck ([pesacheck.org](https://pesacheck.org/false-this-photo-of-a-mother-holding-her-sons-decomposing-bones-is-ai-generated-eba63f96c61d)) also confirms the image is AI-generated.

The BBC ([bbc.com](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c6269pd5y2ko)) published an article about the search for missing people in Gaza, including images of human remains found in the rubble (![image 797](media/2025-07-20_09-55-1753005328-675550.jpg)), and a resident who found a skeleton in his home (![image 799](media/2025-07-20_09-55-1753005329-215344.jpg)). The article also mentions a 13-year-old girl, Aya al-Dabeh, who was killed while staying in a school (![image 803](media/2025-07-20_09-55-1753005330-114461.jpg)).
