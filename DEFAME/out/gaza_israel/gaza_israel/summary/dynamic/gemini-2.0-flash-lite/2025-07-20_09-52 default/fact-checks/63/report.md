Content: The image in the claim is of two mummified children in a Bolivian museum, not children found in Gaza. The image was posted on Instagram and the source of the claim is ali_alhasasna1. The image was posted on Fliker by Tanya Knight on 25/12/2006. ![image 38](media/63.jpg), ![image 1754](media/2025-07-20_10-49-1753008540-134714.jpg), ![image 1755](media/2025-07-20_10-49-1753008542-688557.jpg).

### Evidence from `web_search`
UNICEF USA reported on May 28, 2025, that over 50,000 children in Gaza have been reported dead or injured since October 2023, and mentioned 10 siblings under 12 were pulled from the rubble of their home in Khan Younis (<image:i>). PBS News reported on an Israeli airstrike in Khan Younis, Gaza, in March 2025, that killed at least 16 people, mostly women and children, including a month-old baby girl whose parents and brother were killed (![image 1757](media/2025-07-20_10-49-1753008566-626104.jpg)). Democracy Now! published a story on May 27, 2025, about an Israeli airstrike on the home of a Palestinian pediatrician in Gaza, killing nine of her ten children (![image 1758](media/2025-07-20_10-49-1753008574-217858.jpg)).

The provided sources do not contain information about the specific image or the claim that two children were found dead under the rubble of their home two months after an Israeli airstrike.


## Elaboration
The image in the claim is of two mummified children in a Bolivian museum, not children found in Gaza. The image was posted on Instagram by ali_alhasasna1. The image was posted on Fliker by Tanya Knight on 25/12/2006.


## Final Judgement
The claim misrepresents the origin and content of the image. The image is of mummified children in a Bolivian museum, not children found in Gaza. Therefore, the claim is misleading.

`misleading`

### Verdict: MISLEADING

### Justification
The image in the claim depicts mummified children from a Bolivian museum, not children found in Gaza as the claim suggests, as confirmed by a reverse image search ([Source](https://kashif.ps/en/index.php/2025/04/14/image-of-two-mummified-children-in-a-bolivian-museum-goes-viral-as/)).
