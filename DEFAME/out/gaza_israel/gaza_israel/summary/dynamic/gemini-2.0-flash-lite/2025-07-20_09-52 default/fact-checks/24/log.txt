Content: The DW article fact-checks the claim that UNRWA is mourning Yahya Sinwar's death by adding a black ribbon to its profile picture. The article states that the black ribbon was added to the profile picture on October 22, 2023, and on Facebook on October 11, 2023, to symbolize solidarity with the victims of war, long before Sinwar's death. The article also mentions that not all UNRWA social media accounts have the black ribbon. The article was published by DW.

Content: The Canadian Press News fact-checked the claim that UNRWA added a black band to its social media profiles to mourn Yahya Sinwar's death. The fact-check found that the black band was present on UNRWA's social media profiles before Sinwar's death.

Useful result: From [Source](https://pesacheck.org/false-unrwa-didnt-update-its-profile-photo-to-mourn-the-death-of-hamas-leader-yahya-sinwar-f8219db942b5): 
Content: The PesaCheck article, published on October 28, 2024, states that the claim that UNRWA updated its profile photo with a black band to mourn the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar is FALSE. The black ribbon is a tribute to UNRWA team members killed in Gaza. The article mentions that the UNRWA logo was updated on October 18, 2023.

The claim '<image:18> This image shows a screenshot of the X profile of UNRWA which has placed a black band over its profile photo in mourning for the death of Yahya Sinwar, Hamas leader in the Gaza Strip, in October 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is demonstrably false. Multiple fact-checking sources, including DW ([https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-black-ribbon-on-unrwa-logo-does-not-show-mourning-for-sinwar/a-70532996](https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-black-ribbon-on-unrwa-logo-does-not-show-mourning-for-sinwar/a-70532996)), The Canadian Press News ([https://www.thecanadianpressnews.ca/fact_checking/black-band-on-unrwas-social-media-profiles-appeared-before-yahya-sinwars-death/article_33032eb2-f64b-55c6-8a57-3289e6a014cf.html](https://www.thecanadianpressnews.ca/fact_checking/black-band-on-unrwas-social-media-profiles-appeared-before-yahya-sinwars-death/article_33032eb2-f64b-55c6-8a57-3289e6a014cf.html)), and PesaCheck ([https://pesacheck.org/false-unrwa-didnt-update-its-profile-photo-to-mourn-the-death-of-hamas-leader-yahya-sinwar-f8219db942b5](https://pesacheck.org/false-unrwa-didnt-update-its-profile-photo-to-mourn-the-death-of-hamas-leader-yahya-sinwar-f8219db942b5)), confirm that the black band on UNRWA's profile was added before Yahya Sinwar's death and was not in mourning for him.

So, the overall veracity is: false
