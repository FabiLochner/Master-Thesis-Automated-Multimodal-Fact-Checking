## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/9/poland-says-it-will-protect-benjamin-netanyahu-from-potential-arrest](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/9/poland-says-it-will-protect-benjamin-netanyahu-from-potential-arrest)) reported on January 9, 2025, that Poland would allow senior Israeli officials, including Netanyahu, to travel to Poland for the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau in January 2025, despite an ICC arrest warrant for Netanyahu. The Los Angeles Times ([https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-01-09/polish-president-seeks-protection-for-netanyahu-if-he-attends-auschwitz-anniversary-event](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-01-09/polish-president-seeks-protection-for-netanyahu-if-he-attends-auschwitz-anniversary-event)) also reported on January 9, 2025, that the Polish President is seeking protection for Netanyahu if he attends the Auschwitz anniversary event.

DW.com ([https://www.dw.com/en/auschwitz-poland-netanyahu-arrest-pledge/a-71377468](https://www.dw.com/en/auschwitz-poland-netanyahu-arrest-pledge/a-71377468)) reported on January 22, 2025, that the Polish government guaranteed safe passage to Netanyahu for an event at Auschwitz, despite an ICC arrest warrant, and that Netanyahu was not planning to attend. <image:k>


## Elaboration
1.  The provided evidence indicates that in January 2025, Poland was preparing to protect Netanyahu from potential arrest related to an ICC warrant, and that Netanyahu was invited to an event in Poland.
2.  The evidence does not mention any missile attacks on Israel or Netanyahu fleeing to Poland on October 1, 2024.
3.  The claim is not supported by the evidence. The evidence suggests that Netanyahu was invited to Poland in January 2025, not that he fled there in October 2024.


## Final Judgement
The claim that Netanyahu fled to Poland amid an Iranian missile attack on October 1, 2024, is not supported by the provided evidence. The evidence indicates that Poland was preparing to protect Netanyahu from potential arrest in January 2025, and that he was invited to an event in Poland. There is no mention of a missile attack or Netanyahu fleeing to Poland in October 2024.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While reports from January 2025, such as those from [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/9/poland-says-it-will-protect-benjamin-netanyahu-from-potential-arrest) and the [Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-01-09/polish-president-seeks-protection-for-netanyahu-if-he-attends-auschwitz-anniversary-event), indicate that Poland was prepared to protect Netanyahu from arrest and that he was invited to an event, there is no evidence of him fleeing to Poland on October 1, 2024, amid an Iranian missile attack.
