## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/22/us-army-says-two-navy-pilots-shot-down-over-red-sea-in-friendly-fire](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/22/us-army-says-two-navy-pilots-shot-down-over-red-sea-in-friendly-fire)) reported on December 22, 2024, that two U.S. navy pilots were shot down over the Red Sea in a "friendly fire" incident. The Times of Israel ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/us-strikes-houthi-targets-in-yemen-takes-down-drones-over-red-sea/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/us-strikes-houthi-targets-in-yemen-takes-down-drones-over-red-sea/)) reported that the U.S. struck targets in Yemen on December 21, 2024, in response to a missile fired by Houthi rebels that struck Tel Aviv, Israel.

USNI News ([https://news.usni.org/2025/01/02/top-stories-2024-the-battle-between-the-houthis-and-commercial-shipping](https://news.usni.org/2025/01/02/top-stories-2024-the-battle-between-the-houthis-and-commercial-shipping)) reported that the U.S. and the United Kingdom launched joint strikes against the Houthis in Yemen in January 2024. ![image 573](media/2025-07-18_21-15-1752873347-054047.jpg), ![image 576](media/2025-07-18_21-15-1752873348-856476.jpg), ![image 584](media/2025-07-18_21-16-1752873362-165745.jpg), ![image 582](media/2025-07-18_21-16-1752873361-490728.jpg), ![image 583](media/2025-07-18_21-16-1752873361-931276.jpg)


### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image ![image 5](media/4.jpg)

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the U.S. did strike targets in Yemen on December 21, 2024, in response to a missile fired by Houthi rebels that struck Tel Aviv, Israel. The image's source is Getty Images, and the credit is given to Anadolu. The claim states that the U.S. bombarded Yemen on December 22, 2024, which is consistent with the provided evidence.

However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the image depicts the U.S. bombing Yemen. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified.

Additional information is needed to confirm that the image depicts the U.S. bombing Yemen on December 22, 2024.


## Final Judgement
The claim is partially supported by the evidence, as the U.S. did strike targets in Yemen around the date mentioned. However, the image's origin and the specific event it depicts are not explicitly confirmed by the search results. Therefore, the claim is `misleading`.

### Verdict: MISLEADING

### Justification
The claim is misleading. While the U.S. did strike targets in Yemen on December 21, 2024, as reported by the [Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/us-strikes-houthi-targets-in-yemen-takes-down-drones-over-red-sea/), the provided evidence does not confirm that the image depicts this specific event. The image's source is Getty Images, credited to Anadolu, but the search results do not explicitly link the image to the U.S. strikes on December 22, 2024.
