## Claim
Claim: "![image 6](media/5.jpg) This image shows an Israeli helicopter shot down by Hezbollah amid clashes in Southern Lebanon on November 23, 2024."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(![image 6](media/5.jpg))
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (![image 6](media/5.jpg)) appears in multiple sources. One source, from The Times of Israel, states that the image is related to an attempt by a Palestinian Islamic Jihad cell to down an Israeli military helicopter during fighting in Gaza in May 2019. Another source, PesaCheck, fact-checks the image and states that it is not of an Israeli helicopter shot down in southern Lebanon. A third source, Arab News PK, uses the image in an article about Israeli jets striking Hamas targets in Gaza in March 2019.

The articles can be found here: [The Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/hamas-tried-to-down-an-idf-helicopter-during-fighting-this-month-report/), [PesaCheck](https://pesacheck.org/archive/2024/12/03), and [Arab News PK](https://www.arabnews.pk/node/1472406/middle-east).


## Elaboration
The evidence contradicts the claim. The image is not of an Israeli helicopter shot down in Southern Lebanon on November 23, 2024. The image is related to events in Gaza in 2019.


## Final Judgement
The image is not of an Israeli helicopter shot down by Hezbollah amid clashes in Southern Lebanon on November 23, 2024. The image is related to events in Gaza in 2019. Therefore, the claim misrepresents the origin, content, and meaning of the image.

`misleading`

### Verdict: MISLEADING
