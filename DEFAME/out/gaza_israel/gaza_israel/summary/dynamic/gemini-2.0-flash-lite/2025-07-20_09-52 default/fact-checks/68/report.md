## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
From [Source](https://daraa24.org/%D8%A5%D8%B5%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%A9-%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%A8%D9%8A%D9%86-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A8%D9%84%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%AD%D8%AA%D8%A9/): Found exact image on website with title: إصابة شابين في بلدة ناحتة شرقي درعا
Content: The search result is from Daraa24.org and contains the exact image. The article is titled "إصابة شابين في بلدة ناحتة شرقي درعا" (Injuring two young men in the town of Nahta, east of Daraa). The article reports that two young men were injured in Nahta, Daraa governorate, during a dispute. ![image 41](media/68.jpg)


## Elaboration
The image is associated with an article from Daraa24.org, which reports on the injury of two young men in Nahta, Daraa governorate, during a dispute. The image is not related to Israel bombing the surroundings of Southern Damascus or the destruction of army depots.

The claim is therefore false.
