Useful result: From [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/1/irans-missile-attack-against-israel-what-we-know-and-what-comes-next): 
Content: The Al Jazeera article, published on October 1, 2024, reports on an Iranian missile attack on Israel. <image:k> The attack was in response to Israeli attacks against people in Gaza and Lebanon, as well as the assassinations of top IRGC, Hamas, and Hezbollah leaders.

The US and Israel worked together to shoot down most of the projectiles, and no deaths were reported in Israel. The article also mentions that US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and his Israeli counterpart Yoav Gallant had discussed the consequences for Iran should it launch a direct military attack on Israel.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/g-s1-25707/iran-israel-hezbollah-lebanon-attack): 
Content: NPR published an article on October 1, 2024, reporting on a massive missile attack on Israel by Iran. The article mentions that Israel shot down most of the Iranian missiles.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-october-1-2024): 
Content: The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) and Critical Threats Project (CTP) report that on October 1, 2024, Iran launched a two-wave ballistic missile attack from Iranian territory targeting Israel. The attack was in response to Israel's killing of senior Axis of Resistance leaders. The IDF reported that Israel and its allies intercepted the "majority" of the Iranian ballistic missiles. The report does not mention Yoav Gallant.

The claim 'Gallant, a retired military general and a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s war cabinet, was killed in the Iranian attack on Israel on October 1, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. Evidence from multiple sources, including a PesaCheck fact-check, confirms that Yoav Gallant was not killed in the Iranian attack on October 1, 2024. Furthermore, he was active after the attack, meeting with military officers on October 4, 2024, and later being fired as Defense Minister in November 2024.

So, the overall veracity is: false
