The Bangkok Post ([https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/2966381/no-israeli-settlement-or-business-dominance-found-in-northern-thailands-pai](https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/2966381/no-israeli-settlement-or-business-dominance-found-in-northern-thailands-pai)) reported on February 23, 2025, that police in Pai district, Mae Hong Son, Thailand, found no Israeli influence, settlements, or business dominance, with 4,573 Israelis visiting and only 24 seeking to extend their stay. The Nation Thailand ([https://www.nationthailand.com/news/tourism/40046434](https://www.nationthailand.com/news/tourism/40046434)) published an article on February 18, 2025, refuting claims of an Israeli "promised land" in Pai district, clarifying that the reported figure of 30,000 Israeli tourists refers to the total number of Israeli visitors over the past year, not a permanent settlement.

Khaosod English ([https://www.khaosodenglish.com/featured/2025/02/23/why-some-thais-fear-israelis-turning-pai-into-an-occupied-land/](https://www.khaosodenglish.com/featured/2025/02/23/why-some-thais-fear-israelis-turning-pai-into-an-occupied-land/)) discussed fears among some Thais that Israelis are turning Pai District into an occupied land, with the Prime Minister assuring the public that these fears are unsubstantiated. The article also mentions the Israeli Embassy in Bangkok urging Israeli tourists to respect local culture and laws. The image ![image 4](media/3.jpg) is included in the article.
