The claim '<image:35> This image shows an Israeli attack on Lebanon on October 21, 2024.' is misleading.
Justification: The claim is misleading. While there were Israeli attacks on Lebanon on October 21, 2024, the image provided in the claim, credited to MAHMOD HAMS, depicts an explosion in the Gaza Strip, not Lebanon, as confirmed by a Getty Images search ([https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/picture-shows-israeli-air-strikes-in-the-gaza-strip-news-photo/1232810997](https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/picture-shows-israeli-air-strikes-in-the-gaza-strip-news-photo/1232810997)).

So, the overall veracity is: misleading
