## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Politico reports that President Trump is expected to issue an executive order on Tuesday to stop UNRWA funding, according to an article published on February 3, 2025 (<image:i>). The Hindu reports that on February 4, 2025, Donald Trump ordered a halt to funding for UNRWA (![image 1](media/0.jpg)). The Brookings article, published on September 7, 2018, discusses Trump's decision to halt funding to UNRWA (![image 975](media/2025-07-20_10-06-1753006013-898051.jpg)).

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Trump halted UNRWA funding. However, the provided sources do not confirm that Trump signed an executive order on January 20, 2025, to halt all funding to UNRWA. Politico reports that an executive order was expected on Tuesday, February 4, 2025, and The Hindu reports that Trump ordered a halt to funding on February 4, 2025. Additionally, a Brookings article from 2018 discusses Trump's decision to halt funding to UNRWA.

The claim is not entirely supported by the evidence. The evidence suggests that Trump halted UNRWA funding, but the exact date of an executive order is not confirmed, and the date in the claim (January 20, 2025) is not supported by the provided sources.

To verify the claim, I would need to find the executive order itself or a reliable source confirming the date it was signed.


## Final Judgement
The evidence suggests that Trump halted UNRWA funding, but the exact date of an executive order is not confirmed, and the date in the claim (January 20, 2025) is not supported by the provided sources. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate.

`misleading`


### Verdict: MISLEADING

### Justification
The claim is misleading. While there is evidence that Trump halted UNRWA funding, the provided sources do not confirm that he signed an executive order on January 20, 2025, as stated in the claim. Sources like [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/03/us-withdraw-un-human-rights-council-trump-00202100) and [The Hindu](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trump-stops-us-involvement-with-un-rights-body-extends-unrwa-funding-halt/article69181701.ece) suggest the action occurred around February 2025, and a [Brookings article](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/in-one-move-trump-eliminated-us-funding-for-unrwa-and-the-us-role-as-mideast-peacemaker/) from 2018 discusses a similar action.
