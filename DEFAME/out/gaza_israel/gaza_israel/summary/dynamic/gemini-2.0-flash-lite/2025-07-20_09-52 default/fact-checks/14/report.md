Content: The Times of India published an article on May 14, 2025, about a toilet explosion in Noida, India. ![image 12](media/14.jpg) The article states that the explosion was caused by methane gas buildup from a clogged drain.


## Elaboration
The image depicts a toilet that has exploded. The evidence indicates that the image was used in an article by The Times of India, published on May 14, 2025, about a toilet explosion in Noida, India, caused by methane gas buildup.
