Useful result: From [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2024/oct/14/gaza-tents-engulfed-by-flames-next-to-al-aqsa-hospital-after-israeli-airstrike-video): 
Content: The Guardian published a video on October 14, 2024, showing tents engulfed in flames after an Israeli airstrike in Gaza <image:2145>.

The claim '<image:46> This image shows tents engulfed in flames after the Iranian strikes against Israel on October 1, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While the web search confirmed Iranian strikes against Israel on October 1, 2024, the image search revealed that the image depicts tents on fire in Gaza, as reported by Al Jazeera on October 14, 2024, contradicting the claim's context.

So, the overall veracity is: false
