Useful result: From [Source](https://abcnews.go.com/International/ismail-haniyeh-assassinated-hamas-political-bureau-history/story?id=112430229): 
Content: ABC News reports on the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh. <image:1433>

The claim '<image:26> This image shows the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on July 31st, 2024. This is how a precision strike looks like: a single missile through the window, and only Haniyeh and his bodyguard are dead. Nobody else in the building is even injured.' is misleading.
Justification: The claim that the image depicts the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh on July 31, 2024, is partially supported. Multiple sources, including reports from The Guardian, CSIS, and The Times of Israel, confirm the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh on the specified date in Tehran. However, the claim's description of the attack's precision and casualties is not fully verified by the available evidence, making the claim misleading.

So, the overall veracity is: misleading
