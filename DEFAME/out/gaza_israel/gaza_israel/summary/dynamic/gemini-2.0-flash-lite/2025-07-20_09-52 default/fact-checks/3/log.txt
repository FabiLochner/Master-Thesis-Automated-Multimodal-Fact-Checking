Content: The South China Morning Post published an article about young Israelis in Pai, Thailand. <image:839>

The claim '<image:4> This image shows Israelis who have stopped fighting the wars in Gaza and Lebanon and moved to become 'settlers' in Pai District, Mae Hong Son Province, Thailand, in February 2025.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. Multiple sources, including the [Bangkok Post](https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/2966381/no-israeli-settlement-or-business-dominance-found-in-northern-thailands-pai) and [The Nation Thailand](https://www.nationthailand.com/news/tourism/40046434), refute the existence of Israeli settlements in Pai District, Mae Hong Son, Thailand. The image is associated with articles discussing the presence of Israelis in Pai, but not as settlers.

So, the overall veracity is: false
