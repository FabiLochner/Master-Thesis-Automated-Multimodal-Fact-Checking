Content: The Washington Post published a video on October 21, 2024, about large explosions near Beirut's international airport on October 20, 2024.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/03/israel-strikes-beirut-lebanon-death-toll-hezbollah-war): 
Content: The Guardian published an article on October 3, 2024, reporting on Israeli strikes in Beirut, Lebanon, which resulted in casualties. <image:924>, <image:925>. The article mentions that the strikes occurred after Iran fired missiles into Israel. The article does not mention any bombing of Beirut's International Airport.

The claim '<image:10> This is an authentic image of Israel bombing Beirut's International Airport in October 2024.' is misleading.
Justification: The claim is misleading. While there were explosions and Israeli strikes near Beirut's airport in October 2024, as reported by sources like the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/), the provided image's authenticity and connection to these events are not verified.

So, the overall veracity is: misleading
