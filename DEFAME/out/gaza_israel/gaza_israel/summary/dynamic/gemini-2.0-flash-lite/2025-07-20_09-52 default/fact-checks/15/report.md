## Actions
```
geolocate(![image 13](media/15.jpg))
reverse_search(![image 13](media/15.jpg))
web_search("Montreal Free Palestine sign")
web_search("Valérie Plante Free Palestine")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.85, 'Canada': 0.07, 'Germany': 0.02, 'Austria': 0.01, 'Israel': 0.01, 'Poland': 0.01, 'Slovenia': 0.01, 'South Korea': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0}

### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (![image 13](media/15.jpg)) shows an electronic traffic sign in Montreal displaying "Free Palestine. Escalate now." According to a CBC News article from July 25, 2024, and a Globe and Mail article from July 24, 2024, the signs were hacked to display the pro-Palestinian slogans. The City of Montreal called the incident an act of vandalism, and a group called Clash Mtl claimed responsibility. The original messages were restored.

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Montreal Gazette reported on July 24, 2024, that electronic message boards at two construction sites in Montreal displayed pro-Palestinian slogans, including "free Palestine" and "escalate now" (![image 13](media/15.jpg)).

The Maple article also mentions that Jeremy Levi, the mayor of the Montreal suburb of Hampstead, called on Montreal Mayor Valerie Plante to "take a stand" regarding the signs.

## Elaboration
The image shows a traffic sign in Montreal displaying a "Free Palestine" message. The evidence confirms that the signs were hacked and displayed pro-Palestinian slogans in July 2024. The City of Montreal called the incident an act of vandalism. The evidence does not support the claim that the message was authorized by Montreal's Mayor Valérie Plante; in fact, she condemned the actions.


## Final Judgement
The claim is misleading. While the image is real and the signs did appear in Montreal, the claim misrepresents the context by stating the message was authorized by the mayor. The signs were the result of hacking and the city condemned the action. `misleading`

### Verdict: MISLEADING

### Justification
The image depicts a traffic sign in Montreal displaying a "Free Palestine" message. However, the sign was hacked and the city considered it an act of vandalism, not authorized by Mayor Valérie Plante, who condemned the action, as reported by the [CBC News](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/montreal-traffic-signs-pro-palestinian-slogans-1.7274809) and [The Globe and Mail](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-montreal-traffic-signs-apparently-hacked-to-display-pro-palestinian/).
