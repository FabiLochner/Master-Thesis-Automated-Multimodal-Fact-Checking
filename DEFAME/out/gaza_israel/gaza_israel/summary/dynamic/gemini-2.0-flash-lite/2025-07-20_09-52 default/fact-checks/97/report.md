## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The United Nations News published an article on November 20, 2024, stating that the United States vetoed a UN Security Council draft resolution demanding an immediate and unconditional ceasefire in the Gaza Strip (![image 1](media/0.jpg)). The Security Council Report published on November 19, 2024, discusses a draft resolution on the war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas. The US was expected to vote on the draft resolution on November 20.

The United Nations Security Council failed to adopt a resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza due to a veto by the United States on November 20, 2024. The resolution, supported by 14 Council members, also demanded the release of hostages and access to basic services for Gaza's civilian population.

## Elaboration
The provided evidence does not contain any information about the US reinstituting the draft in 2024 for the Israel-Hamas war. The evidence focuses on the US vetoing a UN resolution regarding a ceasefire in Gaza.

Therefore, I cannot verify the claim.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Wikipedia article "Conscription in the United States" ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_the_United_States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_the_United_States)) details the history of the draft in the US, including its use in World War I, World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. The article does not mention the US reinstituting the draft in 2024.

The Warfare History Network published an article discussing the history of the draft, mentioning the draft during the Vietnam era and the requirement for young men to register for the draft until April 1975. The article includes images of American draftees in June 1917 (![image 1](media/0.jpg)) and soldiers during WWII (![image 2](media/1.jpg)).


## Elaboration
The provided evidence does not support the claim that the US reinstituted the draft in 2024 for the Israel-Hamas war. The search results detail the history of the draft in the US and the US's actions regarding the Israel-Hamas war, but they do not mention the draft being reinstituted in 2024.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The search results do not provide any information about the US reinstituting the draft in 2024 for the Israel-Hamas war. The evidence focuses on the US's actions regarding the war, including vetoing a UN resolution, and the history of the draft in the US.

The claim is demonstrably false because there is no evidence to support it. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is demonstrably false. Multiple searches, including a review of the history of the US draft ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_the_United_States)), and news regarding the Israel-Hamas war, failed to provide any evidence that the US reinstituted the draft in 2024.
