## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
According to an article from Anadolu Agency, published on June 25, 2025, Esmail Qaani was seen alive in Tehran during celebrations, contradicting reports of his assassination. The article mentions Israeli airstrikes on Iranian sites since June 13, 2025. (<image:0>) The Jerusalem Post also published an article on June 25, 2025, discussing whether Qaani is still alive.

The Daily Caller published an article on April 7, 2025, debunking the claim that Qaani fled to Israel, stating there is no evidence to support this claim. (![image 1763](media/2025-07-20_10-50-1753008652-843655.jpg)) The article mentions Qaani was seen at rallies in February 2025.
