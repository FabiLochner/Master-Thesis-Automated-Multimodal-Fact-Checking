Wikimedia Commons credits a blog post from the US National Guard as the source of the image. While the site has since been deleted, an archived version available via the Internet Archive says that the men in the image are two sergeants named Robbie Doman and Christopher W. Sullenberger. Doman, standing in the middle of the photograph, received media coverage in 2017 when he appeared on the NBC television show ""American Ninja Warrior"" after being injured in an explosion in 2008 (archived here, and here).

The claim that it is an authentic image is therefore false.
",True,"However, November 2024 social media posts claiming he was hospitalized with a ""serious health issue"" are false; the Israeli leader gave a speech to lawmakers when he was supposedly admitted, and experts told AFP the image shared online is likely AI-generated. The photo being shared of Netanyahu was likely generated by artificial intelligence, experts said. Hany Farid, a digital forensics expert at the University of California-Berkeley (archived here), said he analyzed the image using three models trained to identify pictures created using artificial intelligence, all of which classified it as ""likely"" being AI-generated. He told AFP on November 19 that he compared the image with actual photographs of Netanyahu and found the left ear was different from that of the Israeli prime minister, indicating it is ""not authentic."" Siwei Lyu, director of the State University of New York at Buffalo's Media Forensic Lab (archived here), also ran the image through a program designed to detect deepfake images and found it is likely not authentic. He, too, noted differences in the shape of the prime minister's ear compared to the one seen in the posts."
7,The Huthi rebels announced the final cessation of their military operations in international waters after Trump won the 2024 US presidential election.,FALSE,MISLEADING,"The claim is misleading. While there was a 2025 ceasefire where the Houthis ceased attacks on commercial shipping, they continued targeting Israeli vessels, and later violated their pledge, as reported by [Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/). The evidence does not support the claim that the Houthis announced the final cessation of their military operations in international waters after Trump won the 2024 US presidential election.
",False,"The militant group has said it will not halt its military operations, which come in response to Israel's bombardment of the Gaza Strip.

The ICJ said Israel's continued occupation of Palestinian territories was against international law, in a nonbinding advisory opinion issued on July 19 on the request of the UN General Assembly. In June 1967, Israel crushed some of its Arab neighbours in a six-day war, seizing the West Bank and East Jerusalem, at the time annexed by Jordan, the Golan Heights from Syria, and the Gaza Strip and Sinai Peninsula from Egypt."

",False,"On May 23, 2017, Trump met with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in Bethlehem in the West Bank. We found no evidence that he’s been to Gaza. President Bill Clinton visited Gaza in 1998; experts said he’s the last president to visit Gaza. Trump actually stated the claim in an interview, but the claim is wrong."

Multiple news sources, including the BBC News, UN News, and the Associated Press, report on explosions in Lebanon in September 2024, specifically targeting walkie-talkies and pagers used by Hezbollah, which resulted in casualties. The Associated Press article includes the image in the claim.
",False,"The image of an exploded iPhone being shared as if it was from recent device attacks in Lebanon was published in a 2021 article about an exploding iPhone in a suburb of Cairo, Egypt. Credible news reports of the attacks in Lebanon did not say that iPhones were devices targeted in the attacks."
57,"<image:32> This image shows Palestinian baby Sham Imad Muhareb which did not lose her arm in an Israeli airstrike on the Shejaeya neighborhood, east of Gaza City, in April 2025.",FALSE,NEI,"The claim is partially verifiable. While the image is confirmed to be of Sham Imad Muhareb, and there were Israeli airstrikes in the Shejaia neighborhood in April 2025, the provided evidence does not confirm whether the baby lost her arm in an Israeli airstrike. Therefore, the claim is considered to have `not enough information`.
",False," Misbar’s investigative team spoke with Nahed Hajjaj, the original photographer of the widely shared photo showing Sham after her amputation. Hajjaj told Misbar he took the photo two days earlier at Al-Ahli Arab Baptist Hospital, where Sham was treated after an Israeli attack targeted her family’s house in the Shuja’iyya neighborhood. He confirmed that Sham lost her right arm and died the following day due to the severity of her injuries. Nahed also posted footage of baby Sham on his Instagram account two days ago, providing details about the Israeli airstrike that targeted her family."

However, the claim that Gaza was ""completely destroyed"" is an overstatement, as the evidence indicates that nearly 69% of buildings were destroyed or damaged, not 100%.
",True," Aerial Footage Shows the Destruction in Zamalka City, in Syria. The video includes an Arabic phrase, which upon translation, indicates that the footage does not show Gaza. After selecting the text, using the translation option in Google reverse image search, Google Translate showed that the Arabic phrase means, “Aerial shots of the town of Zamalka in the Damascus countryside,” not Gaza as claimed. The video ends with the logo of the Syria TV channel, casting further doubt on the claim's validity. Upon searching for the keywords “Zamalka” and “Syria TV” in Arabic, Misbar’s team found the same video published on the Syria TV YouTube channel on Dec. 16, 2024, titled: “Aerial footage of the town of Zamalka in the Damascus countryside shows the massive destruction of its buildings.” The video showed several aerial shots of the Syrian city Zamalka, 10 kilometers away from the capital Damascus, where the city is completely destroyed and deserted."

",False," Iran is preparing to strike Israeli target from Iraqi territory, according to the Jerusalem Post. The plans are in response to attacks by Israel on Iranian soil, marking an escalation in the conflict, the outlet reported. The image accompanying this tweet is not recent. It originates from October 7, 2023, and has been repurposed to support claims of recent attacks. The specific details of the alleged ambush, including the use of bulldozers and explosives, have not been confirmed by credible sources. Independent military analysts and organizations tracking the conflict have not corroborated the incident or reported similar activity matching this description in recent days. Furthermore, while it is possible for older images to resurface in military contexts, this image has been previously used in unrelated posts, weakening the tweet’s credibility. Notably, accounts such as @sentdefender, @ozraeliavi, and @Global_Mil_Info, highlight that the accompanying photo lacks context and should not be used as evidence of the tweet’s claims, or at least confirm that the photos are not new.

While the search results include articles about events in Gaza and images of Palestinian women, they do not contain the image of the tank with clothes drying on it. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified due to a lack of information.
",False," 2000 Photo of Israeli Tank Left Behind in South Lebanon Resurfaces Online. Contrary to social media users’ viral claim, the image is not recent and was not shot in Palestine. The image dates back to 2000 and depicts a woman using an Israeli tank that was left over in Lebanon after the IOF pulled back to the international border line, ending a 22-year occupation of south Lebanon. The image was published in a report on the website of the war-zone correspondent and political analyst of the events in the Middle East and North Africa Elijah J. Magnier, titled ""20 Years After the Unconditional Israeli Withdrawal from Lebanon: Where Are We? The report attributed the attached photo to Younes Zaatari, with a description indicating that it was taken in southern Lebanon in 2000.

",True," Photos Show Recent Pro-Palestine Protests in Bangladesh. Misbar’s investigation found that the photos, falsely claimed to show protests in India, capture pro-Palestine demonstrations in Bangladesh amid the ongoing Israeli war on Gaza. Misbar's team conducted a detailed reverse image search and traced the photos to Somoy TV, a Dhaka-based news outlet. Somoy TV originally uploaded the images on Facebook, stating they show protests held at Suhrawardy Udyan in support of Palestine. The post’s translated caption reads, “March for Gaza. Lakhs of people are gathering in processions at Suhrawardy Udyan. The entire area is filled with slogans.” Misbar’s team verified the location mentioned by several media outlets, Suhrawardy Udyan, and found that the park is based in Dhaka, Bangladesh, not India. By comparing the videos and photos shared of the pro-Palestine protests, Misbar's team found that they all feature the exact location in Bangladesh. Moreover, Misbar’s team searched for reports of recent pro-Palestine protests in India but found no evidence confirming that such demonstrations have occurred there recently."

Misbar’s investigative team conducted a thorough reverse image search and traced the photo back to 2006. A Flickr user originally uploaded it, stating that the image shows two mummified Spanish children from the 1800s. The user noted that she took the photo on December 22, 2006, at the Mint Museum in Potosí, Bolivia. The original caption reads, “It's always a surprise what you find in museums. In the Mint Museum in Potosí, Bolivia, I found two mummified Spanish children from the 1800s. Gruesome stuff.” Another Flickr user also uploaded a photo of the same mummified children, confirming the same details. The user stated that he took the picture at the Mint Museum in Potosí, Bolivia, on May 17, 2007. In addition, a tourism website published the same photo of the mummified children alongside other photos from the Mint Museum in Potosí, Bolivia."

",True," Old Photo Shows Aftermath of Israeli Airstrike on Nabatieh, Lebanon. Contrary to social media users’ viral claim, the photo is unrelated to the recent Israeli airstrike on the Gaza Strip. A thorough reverse image search traced the image back to June 2024, capturing an Israeli airstrike on a residential neighborhood in Nabatieh, South Lebanon. The Cradle news outlet posted the photo on X on June 26, 2024, with the caption: “BREAKING | Israel bombs a residential neighborhood in the city of Nabatieh in South Lebanon, destroying an entire building.

",False," Image of Zelenskyy at a Plant Producing Ammunition for Ukraine. Misbar’s team found that the image shows Zelenskyy signing American bombs produced for Ukraine. A reverse image search led to a YouTube video published by AFP News Agency in September 2024. The video, which included frames similar to the viral image, showed Zelenskyy visiting an ammunition factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania. According to AFP’s description, Zelenskyy visited the United States at the time to seek permission to use Western weapons against targets in Russia. At the 0:56 timestamp, a frame similar to the viral image can be seen. Several news outlets, including BBC and Yahoo News, featured the viral image in reports on Zelenskyy’s September 2024 visit to the United States, where he toured the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant and discussed his “victory plan” to pressure Russia into a diplomatic resolution. AP News also featured the image in a report on Zelenskyy’s visit to the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant. The outlet stated that his visit aimed to thank workers producing one of the most needed types of ammunition for Ukraine in its war with Russia. AP reported that Zelenskyy’s visit to the ammunition plant was intended to thank workers for manufacturing weapons for Ukraine. Finally, Briscs News published the image in September 2024, captioning that it showed Zelenskyy signing bombs intended for use against Russia. According to the official website of the Ukrainian president, the Army Ammunition Plant is fully dedicated to meeting Ukraine’s ammunition needs, particularly for producing 155mm shells. "

",False," No Record of Turkish President Making Such a Statement. Contrary to social media users’ viral claim, Misbar’s team found no evidence supporting the viral claim that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan threatened Israel or urged the United States to control its ally over its intervention in southern Syria. Misbar’s investigative team reviewed Erdogan’s official X account and found no such statement. In addition, Misbar’s team searched the Turkish presidency’s Directorate of Communications but found no official statements mentioning the U.S. or Israel in connection with the recent incursion into southern Syria."

",False," 2021 Israeli Airstrike on Gaza. Misbar's team found through reverse image search that the photo shows an Israeli airstrike on Gaza in April 2021. The photo was originally published by Agence France-Presse (AFP) and taken by the photographer Said Khatib. According to AFP’s caption, the photo showed the explosion of an Israeli airstrike on Rafah, a city in southern Gaza Strip. The Israeli Occupation Forces stated that the airstrike was conducted in response to a rocket launch from the Strip. The photographer also shared the photo to his Facebook account in April 2021, along with another picture of the same airstrike captured at a different moment. Additionally, several reputable outlets featured the photo in reports on the airstrike or analyses on the situation between Hamas and Israel, such as Haaretz and Middle East Eye. Middle East Eye reported that Israel struck two “training sites” in southern Gaza, which came hours after a rocket was fired into southern Israel. The rocket attack on Israel struck open ground and caused no casualties or damage, according to an Israeli spokesperson. It bears noting that the photo was previously misrepresented as an airstrike on Syria. In October 2022, the Jewish Press, an American news outlet, shared the photo falsely claiming that it showed an Israeli rocket attack on Damascus."

Misbar’s investigative team found that the photo had been circulated multiple times in the past, always shared as depicting Israeli occupation forces in the West Bank, Palestine. Nawa, a local outlet, uploaded the photo in an article on November 30, 2014, reporting on the Israeli military arresting citizens in the West Bank. Alresalah news outlet also published the same photo on November 10, 2015, labeling it as an archive photo in the caption. In addition, the Palestinian Information Center published the same photo in July 2017 while reporting on the Israeli occupation forces’ arrest of a former prisoner."
70,"The Iron Dome intercepted 90% of ballistic missiles fired at Israel in Iran's attack on October 1, 2024.",NEI,TRUE,"The claim is supported by evidence from a PBS News Hour article, which states that the Iron Dome had a success rate of over 90% during the Iranian missile strike on October 2, 2024. An Associated Press article also supports the claim, although it notes that the Iron Dome is not foolproof.
",False," President Donald Trump signed an executive order directing Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth to develop a missile defense plan to defend the United States from ballistic missiles, hypersonic missiles and other aerial threats, according to DefenseScoop. NewsNation and the New York Post reported on Trump’s missile defense executive order. NewsNation reported that “Iron Dome was 90% effective against ballistic missiles fired at Israel by Iran in October, which has prompted Trump to order the planning of a ‘state-of-the-art’ missile defense system to be designed in the United States.” The New York Post reported that the Iron Dome “blasts ballistic missiles out of the sky with an accuracy rate of roughly 90%.” Both of these claims are misleading. The Iron Dome is designed to shoot down rockets and other short-range munitions, such as mortar shells, according to the BBC. It is true that it has been reported that the Iron Dome has shot down 90% of rockets fired, per the BBC. However, the Iron Dome is not used to intercept ballistic missiles, per the BBC. Israel uses David’s Sling and the Arrows 2 and 3 systems to shoot down cruise and ballistic missiles, per the outlet. Furthermore, Israel used the Arrows 2 and 3 missile defense systems to intercept Iranian ballistic missiles during Iran’s October 2024 attack, according to Axios. In addition, the USS Bulkeley and USS Cole fired a dozen anti-missile interceptors, per the outlet. "

The provided evidence does not support the assertion that Yair Netanyahu was killed in the attack.
",True," NewsMeter found that the claim is false. A keyword search led us to a report by BBC titled, ‘Netanyahu says he is undeterred after reported drone attack on his home’, dated October 20, 2024. According to the report, a drone was used to target the Israeli PM’s private residence in the coastal town of Caesarea on Saturday morning. Neither Netanyahu nor his wife were present, and no injuries were reported. Further, we found another report by the Times of Israel titled: ‘Israel vows Iran will ‘pay’ for Hezbollah attack on Netanyahu home; Tehran distances itself’, dated October 20, 2024. No casualties were reported. According to the report, on Saturday morning, three drones were allegedly deployed from Lebanon in an assault aimed at the prime minister’s private home. Two of them were stopped near Rosh Hanikra and Nahariya, while the third detonated in Caesarea, a coastal town famous for its luxury homes and ancient Roman remains. At the time, the prime minister and his wife were away from the residence. We found similar updates in reports by India TV, Mint and India Today. None of them mentioned any casualties. Further, we checked Yair’s social media handles and analysed his online activity. We found that Yair Netanyahu's account is active on X. His latest activity was seen on October 21 with a repost of an interview of a Hezbollah leader. We also found Yair’s Instagram account. Although his last post was on October 7, he shared his latest status 10 hours ago. We checked Yair’s Facebook account; his last activity was on October 8. Hence, the claim that the Hezbollah drone attack on the Israeli PM’s home in Caesarea killed his son Yair Netanyahu is false."

Our search for recent reports regarding Gibson’s alleged statement yielded no relevant results. In 2006, Gibson apologized for antisemitic remarks made during his arrest for drunk driving in Los Angeles. Aside from that incident, there have been no recent statements from him concerning Israel amid the ongoing conflict involving Hamas and Iran. We have contacted Gibson’s publicist for a comment and will update the story upon receiving a response. It is noteworthy that this same screenshot went viral in 2023 and was debunked by Reuters and AP News. At that time, Gibson’s representative, Alan Nierob, confirmed, “It is a fake post, as Mr. Gibson does not have any social media platforms.”"

These sources also link the event to an earthquake in Iran and related speculation.
",False," The claim is false. USGS data shows that no earthquake occurred in Israel on or shortly before October 5th. No credible sources have reported that an earthquake occurred near Tel Aviv around October 5th. The EMSC made a post on X that verifies there is no data that indicates an earthquake occurred in Israel around October 5th. The caption reads, “#Israel 19 min ago⚠ We have no data confirming this crowdsourced detection. 👉 It likely was a false detection. No more info will be displayed in the thread. ” When asked for comment, EMSC told Check Your Fact, “we stress the preliminary and unconfirmed nature of this detection. The second message in the thread confirms that this detection has not been confirmed.” Check Your Fact has also reached out to USGS for comment. Due to the tension between Israel and Iran, many social media users have attributed the false detection to an alleged Iranian nuclear test. No reputable sources have reported that Iran conducted a nuclear test on or close to October 5th. "

While reports from January 2025, such as those from [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/9/poland-says-it-will-protect-benjamin-netanyahu-from-potential-arrest) and the [Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-01-09/polish-president-seeks-protection-for-netanyahu-if-he-attends-auschwitz-anniversary-event), indicate that Poland was prepared to protect Netanyahu from arrest and that he was invited to an event, there is no evidence of him fleeing to Poland on October 1, 2024, amid an Iranian missile attack.
",True," Netanyahu’s Travel Claims Disproved During Iranian Missile Attack. Misbar’s team searched the viral claim and did not find any credible news media reporting on it. On the contrary, the latest travel by Netanyahu that could be found on news outlets was before the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah on September 27. The Israeli prime minister traveled to New York to trick Nasrallah into thinking that he was safe, as reported by The Telegraph. Furthermore, Netanyahu published a video on his X account on Wednesday at 12:52 a.m. Israel time, only a few hours after the Iranian missile attack. In the video, the Israeli prime minister was at the Security Cabinet giving a speech on the attack, thanking the U.S. and warning Iran that it made a big mistake, which further confirms that he did not leave Israel for Poland.

",True," Israeli Protesters Carry Coffins During Protest in Tel Aviv. Contrary to the viral claim circulating on social media, the photo does not depict real coffins of Israeli soldiers amid the ongoing military campaigns. Similar images, showing the same location and individuals, were posted by The Jerusalem Post on X, identifying the scene as a protest at Habima Square in Tel Aviv. Misbar’s investigative team conducted a thorough comparison of the circulating image with the one shared by Israeli media and confirmed several similarities, including protesters wearing yellow, holding photos of Israeli hostages, the Israeli flag, objects on the building roof, and the presence of 27 coffins, arranged in three rows of nine. Sky News also shared a video showing Israeli protesters carrying coffins, reporting that the coffins represent hostages killed in Gaza. The outlet noted that widespread protests erupted across Israel following the recovery of six hostages' bodies from Gaza. Moreover, The Times of Israel shared a similar photo of the circulating photo showing the same location and number of coffins during the protest in Habima Square, Tel Aviv. "

Misbar's investigative team traced the original image back to February 16, 2023, following FC Barcelona's announcement to sever ties with Israel. The original photo was posted by i24 News on X that same day, with the caption, “Barcelona football club invites Israeli embassy staff in Spain to match against Manchester United, in show of solidarity after Barcelona mayor's decision to cut ties with Tel Aviv over 'Israeli apartheid'” "

The image was featured in a _Times of Israel_ article from June 25, 2020, and the claim that it was taken by a Hezbollah drone is not supported by the evidence.
",False," On conducting a reverse image search, we found that several Israeli news outlets had published similar images in reports from 2024. A news report by The Times of Israel published on January 30, 2024, headlined, ""State approves repairs to pool in Netanyahu's Caesarea home – report,"" carried the same photo of the property. The image captioned, ""Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's private residence in Caesarea,"" was credited to Israeli public broadcaster KAN. The Times of Israel also used the photo for another article on Netanyahu's house published on July 19, 2024. Another report by Radio J, a French radio station that broadcasts information from the Jewish community, carried the same image in an article published on January 30, 2024, crediting the photo to KAN. Further, upon relevant Google searches in Hebrew, we found a video uploaded by KAN (archived here) on its YouTube channel on July 1, 2019, with the same visuals at the 0:07 timestamp. The video was originally titled in Hebrew and, when translated using Google, reads, ""The villa in Caesarea: The Netanyahu family insists that the state finance the sealing works."" "

",False," A Doctored Screenshot of Channel 12 News’ 2022 Poll. Contrary to social media users’ viral circulation of the image, the screenshot was photoshopped, altering the original captioning of the poll behind the Israeli channel’s presenter. The poll, originally conducted by Channel 12 in May 2022, asked whether respondents agreed with the claim that the government's support leans on terror supporters. The original video showing Channel 12's presenter announcing the poll results was uploaded to YouTube on May 28, 2022. The translated caption of the Hebrew question from the Channel 12 poll reads, ""Do you agree with the claim that the government relies on supporters of terrorism?"" Despite this, the image has been misrepresented on social media, with a false caption suggesting the poll asked if Israeli soldiers should be allowed to rape a prisoner."

The report stated that 20 NATO allies participated in the 53rd iteration of the Baltic Operations 2024 (BALTOPS) held in Kiel, Germany, on June 20, 2024. The report explains that allies gathered at the port in Kiel to reflect on the 21-day BALTOPS exercise that involved 50 ships, 85 aircraft, and nearly 9,000 personnel. The BALTOPS exercise started on June 8, 2024, in Lithuania and involved exercises by warships of NATO countries in the Baltic Sea. The same image was used in a report on the website of the Defense Visual Information Distribution Service (DVIDS), a project of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD). The photo, dated July 6, 2024, with the description “Ships participating in exercise Baltic Operations 2024 (BALTOPS 24) steam in formation through the Baltic Sea, June 8, 2024,” was credited to Mario Coto, a U.S. Navy employee. NATO also posted this image on their official X (formerly Twitter) account (archived here) on June 10, 2024, with the caption, “19 Allies, 50+ ships, 85+ aircraft, 9,000 personnel are training together during the annual maritime exercise #BALTOPS24, where Allies will demonstrate NATO’s ability to preserve freedom of navigation and security in the Baltic Sea.""

Misbar's team identified the image as from February 8, 2009, showing Benjamin Netanyahu, then the leader of the right-wing Likud party, in conversation with his father, Ben Zion Netanyahu, at his father's home. The photo was taken shortly before the Israeli elections in which Benjamin Netanyahu was a candidate for prime minister. The government, led by Netanyahu, head of the right-wing Likud party, was sworn in with a diverse coalition that included members from the left, ultra-Orthodox factions, and the secular extreme right.

While the image's authenticity is not definitively confirmed, it has been associated with discussions about Qaani's movements and potential threats. The claim that the image depicts Qaani in disguise due to fear of Israeli bombing is supported by the context of the image's circulation and related discussions.
",False," We found the original image shared by Tasnim News (archived here) on February 11, 2024, through a reverse image search. The image caption reads, ""The presence of Haj Esmail Qaani in the #March_22_of_Bahman (Translated from Persian)."" The image shows Qaani wearing a black cap and black eyeglasses, not a burqa. The people around him match those in the viral photo. The Islamic Republic News Agency also published the original image in a news report dated February 11, 2024. The image was captioned, ""Sardar Qaani, commander of the Quds Force, attended the march on 22 Bahman. (translated by Persian)."" The report adds that Iranians participated in the march on 22 Bahman, held in Tehran and other cities on February 11, 2024. (22 Bahman refers to the 22 days of the Bahman month (Eleventh month), according to the Persian calendar, which refers to February 11 in the Georgian calendar.) The annual march commemorates Iran's Islamic revolution in 1979, when the monarchy was overthrown and the Islamic Republic was established."
89,"For the assassination on July 31, 2024, Israeli intelligence tracked Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh through WhatsApp.",FALSE,TRUE,"Based on the provided evidence, the claim is likely true. Multiple sources, including the Jerusalem Post and Daraj.media, suggest that Israel uses cell phone tracking and AI, including analyzing WhatsApp data, to target individuals. While there is no definitive proof that WhatsApp was used to track Ismail Haniyeh specifically, the available information supports the possibility, given his assassination on July 31, 2024, and the alleged involvement of Israeli intelligence.
",False," WhatsApp Is Banned in Iran. Contrary to social media users’ spreading conspiracy theory regarding the assassination of Hamas’s Ismail Haniyeh, Meta’s WhatsApp has not been working in Iran since 2022. As protests spread over the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody in Iran, access to Instagram and WhatsApp has been blocked in September 2022. According to data from NetBlocks, authorities have responded with a series of internet restrictions, targeting all users registered with an Iranian (+98) phone number across all major network operators.

Contrary to social media users’ viral claim, the two Hamida children were not killed in a recent Israeli airstrike targeting Al-Jaouni school on July 6. Misbar's investigation team conducted searches using the names of the children and found earlier reports indicating that the children were killed in an Israeli assault on October 22, 2023. A Palestinian media agency published a photo of Mayar Hamida, reporting that she was killed along with her brother Bilal and their mother after Israel bombed their house in the Gaza Strip. The agency stated that they were killed on October 22, 2023. Misbar’s investigative team also found a published photo from October 22, 2023, showing a tweet from a friend of Nidal Hamida, the father of the two siblings.

",True," The U.S. is not conscripting Americans into the military for the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. The video references a bill passed by the House that would automatically register 18- to 25-year-old men for the selective service, but the bill isn't law and doesn't automatically induct individuals into the armed forces. To reinstate a draft, Congress and the president would be required to act. There is no evidence the U.S. has begun forcing Americans to enlist in the military to fight in the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. The website for the Selective Service System – the federal agency that registers men and maintains a system for a potential draft – says there is currently no draft."

However, none of the provided sources mention or show the specific image of Dwayne Johnson wearing the Israeli flag. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.
",False," A close look at the image showed several discrepancies that indicated it could be generated via artificial intelligence. Johnson's left eye is misaligned with his right. His hand holding the placard is unusually large and distorted, and he appears to be holding the placard awkwardly. We also noticed a very different tattoo on his right arm in the viral image, which does not match his original tattoo, as seen on his official Instagram account (archived here). In reality, Dwayne Johnson has a tattoo resembling an animal skull — he had shared an image of him getting the tattoo in 2021 (archived here), saying that it was a ""bull tattoo."" This tattoo can also be seen on his right arm in a recent video (archived here) he posted on his X (formerly Twitter) account on July 1, 2024. Hive Moderation, an online AI detection tool, found this image to be 70.8 percent likely to contain AI-generated or deepfake content. "

The image in question, <image:65>, is likely AI-generated or digitally altered, as indicated by the ""IN VISUAL ART"" watermark and a fact-check article that debunks the image as AI-generated. The claim misrepresents the image as an authentic depiction of an attack.
",True," NewsMeter found that claim is misleading. The incident did occur but the image is AI-generated. Upon examination, the angle and the graphical aesthetics of the photo suggested that the photo might be AI-generated. Further inspection of the image revealed a watermark - IN.VISUALART - indicating its origin. The ‘Ps+ Ai’ notation signified that the image was created using Artificial Intelligence. A keyword search led to an Instagram post from six days ago, where the same photo was shared with a caption stating, “Al-Jazeera obtained leaked footage from a camera mounted by occupation soldiers on a police dog showing the dog attacking an elderly Palestinian woman in her home during an operation the occupation army was about to carry out in Jebalia camp weeks ago. Stop genocide - Ceasefire now- Save Gaza- free Palestine.” A follow-up video on the same channel, with the caption “Video shows Israeli military dog mauling elderly Palestinian woman amid army operation in Jabalia,” featured the elderly woman speaking about the attack. Different news outlets, including the Palestine Chronicle, reported the incident with the title “‘Israelis Set a Dog on Me’ – Video Shows Army Unleashing Dog on Elderly Palestinian Woman.” Hence, the claim is misleading. Although the incident did occur, the viral photo was created using Artificial Intelligence. There are clues in the image that is the focus of this fact check that the picture is not real -- the men's fingers appear abnormally elongated, and the ball of fire behind the Israeli flag appears to be in the sky beside the two World Trade Center towers. Lead Stories also ran the video through True Media, an AI-detection tool, which found substantial evidence that it was created using AI."
