## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
In August 2024, the U.S. military sent additional combat aircraft and warships to the Middle East in response to threats from Iran and its proxies to attack Israel, according to The New York Times ([https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/02/world/middleeast/us-iran-israel-aircraft.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/02/world/middleeast/us-iran-israel-aircraft.html)). Some ships already in the western Mediterranean Sea will move east, closer to the coast of Israel.

L'Orient Today reported on July 31, 2024, that the U.S. sent warships to the Mediterranean, including the USS Wasp, USS New York, and USS Oak Hill (<image:i>) ([https://today.lorientlejour.com/article/1422223/which-american-warships-are-en-route-to-lebanon.html](https://today.lorientlejour.com/article/1422223/which-american-warships-are-en-route-to-lebanon.html)). USNI News reported on August 2, 2024, that the USS Abraham Lincoln is heading to the Middle East (![image 2308](media/2025-07-20_11-08-1753009689-800569.jpg)) ([https://news.usni.org/2024/08/02/carrier-uss-abraham-lincoln-heads-to-middle-east-as-iran-threatens-strikes-against-israel](https://news.usni.org/2024/08/02/carrier-uss-abraham-lincoln-heads-to-middle-east-as-iran-threatens-strikes-against-israel)).


### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (![image 55](media/86.jpg)) shows the USS Mount Whitney and other ships participating in the Baltic Operations 2024 (BALTOPS 24) exercise in the Baltic Sea on June 8, 2024. The exercise involved over 50 ships, 85 aircraft, and approximately 9,000 personnel from NATO allies. The USS Mount Whitney arrived in Kiel, Germany on June 19, 2024, after completing BALTOPS 24.

The image is from the U.S. Navy website. BALTOPS 24 concluded on June 20, 2024, in Kiel, Germany. The photo was taken by Petty Officer 2nd Class Mario Coto.


## Elaboration
The claim is inaccurate. The image depicts the USS Mount Whitney and other ships participating in the Baltic Operations 2024 (BALTOPS 24) exercise in the Baltic Sea on June 8, 2024, not U.S. warships en route to the Lebanon coast in August 2024. The exercise concluded on June 20, 2024.


## Final Judgement
The image is misrepresented. The image shows ships participating in the BALTOPS 24 exercise in the Baltic Sea in June 2024, not U.S. warships en route to the Lebanon coast in August 2024.

`misleading`

### Verdict: MISLEADING

### Justification
The image in the claim is misrepresented. The photo shows the USS Mount Whitney and other ships participating in the Baltic Operations 2024 (BALTOPS 24) exercise in the Baltic Sea on June 8, 2024, as confirmed by a reverse image search. While the U.S. did send warships to the Mediterranean in August 2024, as reported by The New York Times ([https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/02/world/middleeast/us-iran-israel-aircraft.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/02/world/middleeast/us-iran-israel-aircraft.html)), the image does not depict this event.
