Popular Science

In short, while Israel imposes significant regulatory restrictions on DNA testing, particularly those related to familial ties, the claim that DNA tests are outright illegal in Israel is "False."

We reached out to Israel's Ministry of Justice for comment, but had not received a response by the time of publication. A [section](https://www.health.gov.il/English/Topics/Genetics/checks/Pages/GeneticTestingRecommendations.aspx)
 titled "Recommendations for Genetic Testing" outlines guidelines for screening tests aimed at identifying couples at risk of passing severe genetic conditions on to their children.

**Legal But Highly Regulated**
------------------------------

In 2019, The Times of Israel [reported](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-genealogy-company-myheritage-takes-on-dna-health-screening/%20)
 that MyHeritage DNA testing kit was not available in Israel, as the country "does not allow private genetic health screening." Similarly, Ynet news website [reported](https://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-5486172,00.html)
 in 2019: "In Israel it is forbidden to sell home kits for DNA testing. This service is blocked for Israelis."

Israel Democracy Institute also [reported](https://www.idi.org.il/articles/26454)
 that the sale of DNA testing home kits is prohibited in Israel, adding that "quite a few Israelis manage to circumvent the ban."

In 2019, Israel's Ministry of Health [confirmed](https://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-5486172,00.html)
 to Ynet that it is impossible to conduct a DNA test in Israel without a court order and that "the law does not allow the sale of such kits in Israel." However, when asked specifically about the use of ancestry kits for personal curiosity, and not for health reasons, the Ministry staff indicated that they did not recognize this type of application. It also explained that, according to the Genetic Information Law, a DNA test should only be conducted in a recognized and licensed genetic laboratory or genetic institute, and "such a thing cannot exist in kits sold directly to the public."

Reasons Behind the Restrictions
-------------------------------

The Ministry of Health highlighted concerns regarding the reliability and interpretation of DNA testing kits, noting that such kits are "heavily criticized for their degree of reliability, interpretation of results, and potential impact on the individuals and their families." Regarding genetic tests to determine family ties, the ministry emphasized that the law requires a court order to authorize such tests, ensuring the decision is made with consideration of "the best interests of all involved." Officials further stressed the potential consequences of performing these tests, particularly in the context of religious law, where results could have significant implications (emphasis ours):

> Some of the considerations are for fear of serious harm to the benefit of minors or future children in the family, due to the **possibility of being labeled as b\*st\*rds that will cause damage to their fitness to marry in Israel according to Jewish law.** There may be harmful consequences in the religious law of other religions as well. Moreover, even if this wasn't the case, what would prevent my US cousin from doing such a test?

**Ordering DNA Kits from Abroad**
---------------------------------

There was some ambiguity regarding whether such DNA testing kits could be purchased online from Israel and, if so, whether such actions were legally permitted. For instance, the website for 23andMe, a saliva-based DNA testing service, stated that it [does ship](https://int.customercare.23andme.com/hc/en-us/articles/214806628-What-Countries-Do-You-Ship-To)
 genetic testing kits to Israel. It does not mean that what 23&Me or other companies do is illegal, because what they do is send the sample kits to Israel, and the "crime" itself may be carried outside Israel, as they can claim that the Israeli law does not apply to them.
> 
> I assume that these companies have their own legal team that created the right legal atmosphere to allow it or disallow it.

When Ynet interviewed a company that ships DNA testing kits to Israel, it stated they "follow the import and export laws" and "at the moment, customs does not prohibit it, as there is nothing dangerous in such a sample, and I hope it will continue that way."

A DNA Test Can Confirm Jewish Ancestry
======================================

In certain cases, the right to repatriation can be supported by genetic testing (DNA test), which serves to establish a biological relationship with an individual whose Jewish origin has already been officially documented.

**Important:**  
DNA test results are legally valid only if the test is conducted pursuant to an order issued by an Israeli court and carried out in accordance with the prescribed legal procedure.

WHO CAN BENEFIT FROM A DNA TEST IN ISRAEL?
------------------------------------------

How to Prove Jewish Ancestry Through a DNA Test
-----------------------------------------------

If an applicant lacks sufficient documentation confirming Jewish ancestry, the Israeli consul may, following an interview, recommend undergoing genetic testing—or even issue a refusal of the repatriation request. To avoid such outcomes, it is essential to have the documents reviewed in advance by a lawyer, especially if Jewish lineage is through the paternal line.

To conduct DNA testing, a court order from an Israeli court is required. If a refusal has already been issued by the Nativ representative at the consulate, a separate legal process to reinstate the right to repatriation will be necessary — after the DNA procedure has been completed.

A similar process applies to children born to an Israeli father if their birth was not reported to the Israeli consulate abroad within the required timeframe.

To initiate DNA testing, you should consult a licensed Israeli attorney who specializes in family and immigration law.

! <image:1609>

Step-by-Step DNA Testing Process
--------------------------------

How to properly conduct a DNA test so that the results are accepted for repatriation and citizenship by birth:

*   Gather documents confirming the need for testing;
*   Open a case with the Israeli Family Court (personal presence is not required; a licensed Israeli attorney represents the applicants by power of attorney);
*   Obtain approval from the State Attorney’s Office and a court order authorizing the test;
*   Conduct the test as instructed by the court in a certified laboratory in Israel and/or at an Israeli consulate abroad (test kits are sent via diplomatic mail from the Israeli lab). 
    If the relationship is distant, or if the test results indicate a percentage that does not meet the threshold for Israeli citizenship, a medical expert may be brought in, and/or a test may be conducted with a different relative.

!ДНК тест для репатриации в Израиль <image:1610>

How Is a DNA Test Conducted?
----------------------------

The lawyer, acting under power of attorney, files a petition with the court on behalf of the applicant and obtains permission to carry out genetic testing. The samples are then compared with those of the alleged father or other biological relatives.

If the biological father or his blood relatives reside in Israel, their consent is not required—they can be compelled to undergo testing by court order.

DNA testing is conducted exclusively in licensed laboratories in Israel. Tests performed privately or abroad are not recognized by Israeli courts and will not be accepted for legal purposes.

!Доказать еврейские корни по ДНК <image:1611>

Why Do You Need a Specialized Lawyer?
-------------------------------------

It is not possible to prove Jewish ancestry through DNA testing without legal representation. The process is strictly regulated, and the court will not authorize genetic testing unless an attorney is involved.

If the test confirms the applicant’s biological relationship to a person whose Jewish ancestry is documented or to someone who already holds Israeli citizenship, the lawyer can proceed with the repatriation process or apply for citizenship status—particularly in cases involving a child born after the parent acquired Israeli citizenship.

In total, the process may take between 4 and 7 months.

While genetic testing can make the repatriation process more complex, for many applicants, it is the very tool that makes repatriation possible.

The attorneys at our firm have successfully helped hundreds of clients confirm their eligibility for repatriation through DNA testing and obtain Israeli citizenship.

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

### Why is a DNA test needed to establish paternity in Israel?

DNA testing is commonly used to establish paternity when it was not legally recognized at birth or when the child was born outside of marriage. However, it is important to note that DNA testing must be conducted exclusively in certified laboratories in Israel. Results from tests performed abroad are not accepted by the Israeli authorities.

### How to properly conduct a DNA test for repatriation and obtaining Israeli citizenship?

DNA testing is carried out strictly by order of the Family Court in Israel."

‘Very upsetting’: Florida lawmaker slams Gov. Harris, now the presumptive Democratic nominee, [conveyed a forcefulness](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/25/politics/harris-netanyahu-israel-hamas-ceasefire/index.html)
 on civilian suffering and ending the war following her time with the prime minister.

Netanyahu said Friday that he hoped Harris’ comments would not make a ceasefire deal harder to reach.

“I think to the extent that Hamas understands there’s no daylight between Israel and the United States, that expedites the deal,” said Netanyahu to reporters at his meeting with Trump. I actually don’t know how a person who is Jewish could vote for her, but that’s up to them.”

Ahead of Netanyahu’s remarks, [Harris’ office rejected on Friday](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/26/politics/harris-team-netanyahu-meeting-reaction/index.html)
 the suggestion originally from a senior Israeli official that the [vice president’s remarks](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/25/politics/harris-netanyahu-israel-hamas-ceasefire/index.html)
 could have made [a ceasefire deal](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/25/politics/biden-netanyahu-meeting/index.html)
 harder to reach.

“I don’t know what they’re talking about,” a Harris aide told CNN, in response to a senior Israeli official being quoted in [The Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/harris-i-wont-stay-silent-on-gaza-suffering-israel-charges-shes-harming-deal-chances/)
.

“President Biden and Vice President Harris delivered the same message in their private meetings to Prime Minister Netanyahu: it is time to get the ceasefire and hostage deal done,” the aide to the vice president told reporters, adding that Harris’ meeting with Netanyahu was “serious and collegial.”

Trump elaborated on his own meeting with Netanyahu while continuing to slam Harris during a speech in West Palm Beach, Florida, on Friday night.

“She doesn’t like Jewish people. However, their relationship has soured in recent years, and the former president has been reluctant to speak with him throughout the ongoing conflict.

In the immediate aftermath of Hamas’ attack on Israel, Trump criticized Netanyahu for his handling of the war, claiming to Fox News at the time the prime minister and the country overall were “unprepared.”

Part of that criticism, which Trump has continued in the months since, stems from his complicated relationship with Netanyahu, one that a former Trump administration official described as “a love-hate relationship,” who added that the two leaders experienced a dramatic up and down in recent years.

During his administration Trump enacted multiple policies to Israel’s benefit, including moving the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, recognizing Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights and backing multiple countries in Middle East and North Africa to normalize relations with Israel as part of the Abraham Accords. The letter was sent after the assassination attempt on the 2024 Republican presidential nominee.

“Looking forward to seeing Bibi Netanyahu on Friday, and even more forward to achieving Peace in the Middle East!” Trump posted to Truth Social with the letter.

In posting that engagement with Abbas, Trump was trying to “strike a balance” going into the meeting, Bahbah said, adding that he hopes Trump will come out of the Netanyahu meeting calling for an immediate and permanent ceasefire.

Jewish supporters of Trump are hoping the former president asks Netanyahu what he needs to win the ongoing war, explained Lee Zeldin, a Jewish Republican and Trump supporter.

“At the table, the most important question is asking the prime minister what he needs to win. ](https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c-gettyimages-2202160868-20250627192350082.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_250,c_fill)

On Saturday, writing on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump said, “Netanyahu had a terrible and ‘insulting’ meeting with Kamala Harris, who also refused to preside over Congress during his speech, which is an obligation of the V.P. <image:1638>](https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2024/07/AP24207771944651-e1721972768387.jpg)

WEST PALM BEACH, Florida (AFP) — United States presidential candidate Donald Trump falsely accused election rival Kamala Harris of being an antisemite who plans to allow the murder of newborn babies, in a speech meant to rally religious supporters Friday that quickly went off the rails.

The vice president, who is married to a Jewish man, has gained ground on Trump in polling since she replaced Joe Biden on the top of the Democratic ticket just days ago.

Former Republican president Trump dedicated much of his address at a religious convention in southern Florida to assailing Harris’s record as a senator and as Biden’s number two, but many of his attacks were smears untethered to reality.

Explaining why 59-year-old Harris had skipped Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s speech to the US Congress on Wednesday to instead honor a prior commitment, Trump accused her, baselessly, of antisemitism.

“She doesn’t like Jewish people. She’s not going to change,” he said.

The remark — coupled with his claim that Harris “is totally against the Jewish people” in North Carolina on Wednesday — marked an escalation in Trump’s incendiary rhetoric, days after his campaign said an attempt on his life had given him a focus on unity.

Vice President Kamala Harris, left, kisses second gentleman Doug Emhoff at her campaign headquarters in Wilmington, Del., Monday, July 22, 2024. Likewise Catholics, who are being persecuted by this Administration, should not be voting for radical left Kamala,” Trump wrote.

Content: "Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, in a social media post on Thursday, called for the annihilation of Iran if they ever assassinate him, following reports of such plots by Tehran.

[**His statement was made**](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/112848319395019188)
 alongside a video clip of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech to the US Congress on Wednesday, where Netanyahu emphasized Iran's threats.

On Truth Social, Trump wrote, “If they do ‘assassinate President Trump,’ which is always a possibility, I hope that America obliterates Iran, wipes it off the face of the Earth — If that does not happen, American Leaders will be considered ‘gutless’ cowards!”

, the security concerns for those involved in the decision to kill Soleimani remain significant, necessitating ongoing protection measures.

Trump's post echoes his controversial rhetoric from 2019, when he threatened the "obliteration" of Iran if they attacked "anything American."

    Maryam Sinaiee On July 13, twenty-year-old Thomas Michael Crooks opened fire at a Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, killing a former volunteer fire chief and injuring two others. Trump was slightly injured in his ear.

However, no direct link has been found between the reported Iranian plot and the attempted assassination.

[**In a recent interview**](https://www.iranintl.com/en/202407182631)
 with Iran International, Trump's former national security aide John Bolton said that naturally Trump would take the Iranian threat personally.

Trump withdrew from the Obama-era JCPAO nuclear deal with Iran in 2018 and imposed heavy sanctions, that have crippled Iran's weak economy.

Relations between the US and Iran became more strained since the 2020 US drone strike that killed Qasem Soleimani, the former commander of the Revolutionary Guards Quds Force, and Iran's top military intelligence operative in the Middle East.

Iranian officials, both political and military, have persistently issued threats against Trump and former members of his administration to avenge Soleimani's death, who orchestrated Iran's proxy operations throughout the region. For instance, in February 2023, Amirali Hajizadeh, the head of the Revolutionary Guards aerospace force, explicitly declared that the Islamic Republic intends to kill Trump.

In January 2022, Iran's [**former President Ebrahim Raisi**](https://www.iranintl.com/en/202201033940)
 vowed retaliation for Soleimani's killing unless former US President Donald Trump was brought to trial.

"If Trump and (former Secretary of State Mike) Pompeo are not tried in a fair court for the criminal act of assassinating General Soleimani, Muslims will take our martyr's revenge," Raisi said in a televised speech.

In 2022, the US Justice Department brought charges against a member of the IRGC for plotting to assassinate John Bolton, Trump's former national security adviser, likely in retaliation for Soleimani's death. Similar threats have been directed at other former Trump administration officials, including Mike Pompeo and Robert O'Brien, who continue to have security details due to ongoing risks.

Soleimani played a crucial role in Iran's external military and intelligence operations, often orchestrating hostilities against US forces in the region."

US arranges flights to bring Americans out of Lebanon as others seek escape
===========================================================================

In Washington, senior State Department and White House officials met Thursday with two top Arab American officials to discuss U.S. family was mourning Kamel Ahmad Jawad, a resident of metro Detroit’s Dearborn area, who was killed in southern Lebanon on Tuesday after they say he stayed to help civilians too old, infirm or poor to flee.

He had been on the phone with his daughter Tuesday when the impact of a strike knocked him off his feet, his daughter, Nadine Kamel Jawad, said in a statement.

“He simply got up, found his phone, and told me he needed to finish praying in case another strike hit him,” she said.

The State Department has been telling Americans for almost a year not to travel to Lebanon and advising Americans to leave the country on commercial flights for months. It also has made clear that government-run evacuations are rare, while offering emergency loans to aid travel out of Lebanon.

Some Americans said their relatives who are U.S. would continue to organize flights as long the security situation in Lebanon is dire and there is demand.

Miller said Lebanon’s flag carrier, Middle East Airlines, also had set aside about 1,400 seats on flights for Americans over the past week. Embassy in Beirut seeking information about departing the country over the past week.

Not all of those have actually sought assistance in leaving, and Miller said the department understood that some Americans, many of them dual U.S.-Lebanese nationals and longtime residents of the country, may choose to stay.

Miller said the embassy is prepared to offer temporary loans to Americans who choose to remain in Lebanon but want to relocate to a potentially safer area of the country. <image:1657>](https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/national-international/israeli-strike-kills-civilians-beirut-foreign-nationals-evacuate/3732205/)

Newsweek AI is in beta. State Department has begun "assisted departure flights" for U.S. embassy in Israel directed _Newsweek_ to the State Department's media inquiry form.

**Why It Matters**
------------------

Over the past few days, the conflict between Israel and Iran has escalated dramatically, with Trump calling for the evacuation of Tehran, Iran's capital city home to over 9.5 million people.

Israel initially struck Tehran and several other cities in "Operation Rising Lion," a campaign it said was meant to preempt a planned Iranian attack and disrupt Iran's nuclear capabilities.

Iran, which has said its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, has since retaliated, though Israeli defense systems—bolstered by [U.S. military](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/u.s.-military)
 technology—have intercepted about 99 percent of incoming missile fire, according to Israeli officials on Saturday morning in an X, formerly [Twitter](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/twitter)
, post. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Thursday that Trump is expected to make a decision about whether to directly support Israel in its attacks against Iran within the next two weeks.

**What To Know**
----------------

The State Department on Saturday issued a notice with information for U.S. citizens and lawful residents in Iran and Israel on how to leave the countries.

It said, "The Department of State has begun assisted departure flights from Israel," but did not provide further details, including the number or origin of the flights."

" If you choose to take this departure assistance, transportation will be by air to Athens or Frankfurt, or sea from Haifa to Cyprus," it added.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The U.S. government is offering loans to Americans for flights out of Lebanon in October 2024, as tensions escalate between Israel and Hezbollah. The U.S. is also providing charter flights to help Americans leave Israel, starting in October 2023.

The evidence supports the claim that the U.S. government is assisting Americans in both Lebanon and Israel with flights. However, the evidence does not specify that the U.S. has been flying Israeli citizens out of Israel on chartered flights for a year.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported, but the statement about flying Israeli citizens for a year requires further verification.

Former President Donald J. Trump’s strong support for Israel has been central to his campaign, highlighting past achievements like relocating the US Embassy to Jerusalem, recognizing Israeli sovereignty on the Golan Heights, and brokering the Abraham Accords, but polls show that reoccupation of the Gaza Strip would be a far less popular policy among Israelis and American supporters of the Jewish state.

In the interview, Hewitt asked Trump if Gaza could be transformed into a prosperous area like Monaco. The remark came during a conversation with conservative host Hugh Hewitt on Monday, which marked the anniversary of the October 7 attacks by Hamas. Trump, the Republican nominee in this year’s US presidential election, claimed in a recent radio interview that he had visited Gaza, a war-torn region he has never officially been recorded visiting. When asked for clarification, a campaign aide asserted that Gaza is “in Israel” and noted that Trump had visited Israel.

The Gaza Strip, under Hamas control since 2007, is not claimed by Israel, though it was under Israeli military administration from 1967 to 2005. Despite some Israeli calls for its annexation, Gaza remains distinct, separated from Israel and the West Bank. Trump responded, “It could be better than Monaco. You know when—I’ve been there, and it’s rough.”

The Gaza Strip is not part of Israel and has never been, though some Israelis have called for annexing it. In 2007, after Hamas took over Gaza, Israel and Egypt imposed a blockade that restricted access to the area.

The attacks on Tuesday and Wednesday, September 17 and 18, in Lebanon with exploding walkie-talkies and [pagers](/en/exploding-hezbollah-pagers-how-did-it-happen/a-70250960)
 apparently targeted members of [Hezbollah](/en/hezbollah/t-41508807)
. The Iran-backed political party and militant group holds Israel responsible for the [strikes that killed at least 29 persons and injured around 2,800 people](/en/lebanon-explosions-stoke-fear-of-hezbollah-retaliation/a-70261978)
.

In the aftermath of the explosions a lot of fake images, videos and claims have been spreading online claiming to show the incidents.

DW's [fact checking team](/en/fact-check/t-56584214)
 checked three viral claims.

Are iPhones exploding in Lebanon as well?
-----------------------------------------

**Claim:** "An iPhone was also blown up in Lebanon", [a social media user wrote on X](https://archive.ph/yYA3i "External link — a social media user wrote on X")
 (formerly Twitter) sharing an image of a destroyed iPhone with more than 800.000 views.

**DW Fact check:** False.

This image of a destroyed iphone is not related to the current attacks in LebanonImage: X

A reverse image search reveals that this image is old and has nothing to do with the current incidents in Lebanon. The image of the exploded iPhone dates back [to March 2021](https://www.cairo24.com/1166674 "External link — to March 2021")
 when Egyptian news outlet Cairo24 reported an iPhone explosion in Maadi, Cairo. The incident caused a fire and injured a child.

Did exploding solar panels hurt more than 500 individuals?
----------------------------------------------------------

**Claim:** Other social media users insinuated that Israel had caused solar panels to burst into flames. "Lebanon: Sabotaged solar panels have started significant electrical fires. Over 500 individuals have been reported injured so far", [this user wrote](https://archive.ph/rkYv2 "External link — this user wrote")
 featuring an Israeli flag. Attached was an image of burning solar panels and a house on fire.

**DW Fact check:** False.

This claim about burning solar panels in Lebanon is false as wellImage: X

There are no documented cases of exploding solar panels in the current attacks in Lebanon. The image is a collage of two old pictures.

[Via a reverse image search](https://archive.ph/kp26N "External link — Via a reverse image search")
we find both images: [The image on the left](https://perma.cc/6TAZ-EPZ9 "External link — The image on the left")
, showing burning solar panels, dating back to[an X-post](https://x.com/FSRI_org/status/1215631166226817024 "External link — an X-post")
 from February 2020. In the post, the US-American Fire Safety Research Institute shared an article about the safety of photovoltaic systems along with the image.

The second photo shows a burning house [dates back to December 2020](https://www.saobserver.net/news/update-westside-home-fire-a-total-loss-not-suspicious-3723448 "External link — dates back to December 2020")
. The fire incident took place in Canada and not in Lebanon.

Did this laptop explode on September 19 in Lebanon?
---------------------------------------------------

**Claim:** "19-09-2024 – Explosion in Laptops”, a social media user wrote on X [posting a photo of a charred laptop](https://archive.ph/5axnH "External link — posting a photo of a charred laptop")
.

**DW Fact check:** False.

This image of a charred laptop does not have anything to do with the current explosions in LebanonImage: X

The user added "Mossad is unstoppable” blaming the Israeli secret service for the explosions of pagers, walkie-talkies and now laptops as well. So far, there is no evidence that Israel or Mossad is responsible for the attacks. Pagers and walkie-talkies indeed exploded killing and injuring people. But no reliable reports exist that laptops did, as well.

The shared image gives no evidence for something alike either. [A reverse image search](https://archive.ph/5H4Cy "External link — A reverse image search")
 shows that the image dates back to [at least 2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/lcljyb/just_got_my_hands_on_an_engineering_sample_3090/?rdt=64930 "External link — at least 2021")
 when it was posted on Reddit.

So far, only pagers and walkie-talkies exploded in Lebanon according to both regional and international news. While Hezbollah and Iran both hold Israel accountable for the explosions it's not confirmed who is responsible for the attacks.

If you want to know more about how the explosions in Lebanon happened technically, DW Science explains it [in this article](/en/exploding-hezbollah-pagers-how-did-it-happen/a-70250960)

[!Not just pagers: iPhones, laptops, electronic locks and other devices exploded in Lebanon today <image:343>](https://itc.ua/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/photo_2024-09-18_18-09-13.jpg)

On Wednesday, September 18, reports of a second wave of explosions began to come in from Lebanon, mostly from Beirut. Today, iPhones and other electronics were exploded.

As of 21:00, the Lebanese Ministry of Health reported 14 dead and 450 injured in the new wave of explosions. Later, the media reported at least 500 injured. Among them are several children and health workers. The attack again predominantly targeted members of «Hezbollah».

The video shows many explosions in the city.

In addition to the streets and public places, electrical appliances explode in apartments, houses and shops (about 60 cases), as well as cars (at least 15 cases). Among other things, funeral processions of «Hezbollah» officials killed in yesterday’s explosions were hit by the explosions.

An explosion during a funeral.

Among the explosive devices, the media name Apple iPhones and other smartphones, laptops, scooters and mopeds, walkie-talkies, solar panels, and even electronic locks and kitchen appliances. Many sources claim that this includes any device that has a battery.

Explosion in one of the apartments.

Hezbollah also exploded stationary and mobile communication stations «Hezbollah» in buildings and cars. The organization called on its members to get rid of electronics altogether. In crowded places, representatives of «Hezbollah» ordered everyone present to turn off their electronic devices.

There is currently no accurate information on whether the series of explosions in Lebanon has ended. Various sources reported two waves of explosions during the afternoon.

Israel’s Pager Attack Has Cooked More Than Just iPhone Sales in China
=====================================================================

The pager attack in Lebanon has triggered a trust crisis among Chinese consumers of Western-made electronic products, such as iPhone. In the view of Chinese strategist, Prof. Wang Xiangsui, this once again proves that Western-led economic globalization is only a stage in history, not the final destination.

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201%201'%3E%3C/svg%3E)The pager explosions have taken about 12 lives and injured around 3000 people on September 17  

Last week, the pager attack in Lebanon captured global attention. This form of attack not only triggered panic among the Lebanese people but also shook global confidence in economic globalization. This is because Israel has opened Pandora’s box of using civilian product supply chains for military objectives.

The remote-controlled explosions in Lebanon came in two waves. In the first wave, the devices targeted were primarily pagers used by Hezbollah members. According to The Washington Post and other Western media, the explosives were pre-installed in the batteries. But in the second wave, the explosions extended to everyday civilian items like mobile phones, laptops, cars, and even electric razors used in barbershops. Chinese media outlet Guancha reported that this is done by mixing batteries with remote-controlled detonators into ordinary batteries in the Lebanon market, which were then randomly installed into these devices during repairs.

This is almost akin to randomly poisoning a city’s water supply, resulting in widespread, uncontrollable collateral damage. At least 32 people, including two children, were killed and thousands more injured. In fact, it aligns closely with the United Nations General Assembly’s definition of terrorism, reaffirmed since 1994: “criminal acts intended to cause public fear.”

In the realm of global economics, this type of terrorism is causing an alarming effect on a conceptual level.

For example, on Twitter(X), a photo of an iPhone detonated in Lebanon has sparked widespread attention. And on Chinese social media Weibo, Phoenix News created a vote, asking related to trending news, do you believe iPhones’ batteries have security issues? — with 45.6% of 8121 respondents voting “yes.”

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201%201'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201%201'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

This incident has triggered a direct trust crisis among Chinese consumers toward Western electronic products. Three days after the pager attack, the iPhone 16 was launched in mainland China. Normally, consumers would have to queue at stores to get the latest iPhone, often paying scalpers extra. But this year, the iPhone was already being sold at a discount on e-commerce platforms.

On the other hand, Huawei saw a surge in support. This is because, in the Lebanese explosions, manufacturers from Taiwan island and Japan were unaware that their products had been converted into bombs, claiming that external agents or suppliers had tampered with them. Chinese consumers, recalling that U.S. sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction have prevented Huawei from sourcing parts from Western manufacturers, noted that Huawei has increased the localization of its supply chain. Many Chinese commentators argue that U.S. sanctions have, ironically, “de-risked” Huawei phones.

The term “de-risking” was originally popularized by Western media during Trump’s trade war with China. But as Israel’s actions escalate, it seems Western media have lost control of their narrative. After all, when the West imposed long-arm jurisdiction on Chinese smartphones, electric vehicles, and 5G suppliers, it claimed that its safety standards were high and its detection methods sophisticated. These claims only hold water if consumers believe in them, making such jurisdiction legitimate in democratic societies. Now, however, Israel’s covert actions have undermined that legitimacy. If Western countries and Taiwan authorities cannot prove that they can protect their supply chain from the Mossad, they will lose their authority to define “safety standards” in China and around the world.

This, in turn, offers a significant advantage to Chinese companies. Going forward, Huawei and other manufacturers will no longer need to promote compliance with EU or U.S. standards to endorse product quality. Instead, labels like “Produced according to Chinese standards” or “Entirely non-Western suppliers” could become new selling points. This signals a potential shift in consumer value judgments from a unipolar world dominated by Western standards to a multipolar world where “Chinese standards” compete in parallel. This could reshape the direction of economic globalization, introducing new dimensions and market entry rules.

In the past, China made extensive adjustments to its economic policies and production standards to meet the requirements of the World Trade Organization (WTO), particularly in food safety. However, during incidents like the Fukushima nuclear wastewater discharge and the COVID-19 pandemic, China’s technical standards for inspecting seafood and meat products were notably higher than those of Western countries. With global consumer health in mind, this raises the question: Is China now better positioned to set international food hygiene standards? And in other sectors where China has similarly higher standards, shouldn’t they also be adopted by the WTO?

Clearly, if Western countries are genuinely committed to promoting the cross-border flow of production factors—allowing each country to capitalize on its strengths within the global market—then when it comes to ensuring supply chain security and setting safety standards for certain products, China evidently has a comparative advantage, to lead a higher quality economic globalization.

If the global market is truly free, then perhaps it’s time to move beyond a globalization dominated by Western-developed countries and shift toward a multipolar globalization that better reflects the comparative advantages of all nations.

Lebanese media reported that Israeli airstrikes had targeted several areas in the country’s south, beginning at around 5am, causing unspecified casualties.

Hezbollah meanwhile said it had launched a rocket targeting Mossad headquarters near Tel Aviv. Tuesday’s attacks came after [Monday’s barrages racked up the highest death toll](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/23/israel-lebanon-strikes-evacuation-hezbollah)

Israel’s new offensive against Hezbollah has stoked fears that nearly a year of conflict between Israel and the militant Palestinian group Hamas in Gaza is escalating and could destabilise the Middle East. Hezbollah has said it will cease firing rockets at Israel if it agrees a ceasefire in Gaza.

Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian, whose country and Israel are arch-enemies, told the UN general assembly the international community must “secure a permanent ceasefire in Gaza and bring an end to the desperate barbarism of Israel in Lebanon, before it engulfs the region and the world.”

Israel’s military said its air force conducted “extensive strikes” on Tuesday on Hezbollah targets across southern Lebanon, including weapons storage facilities and dozens of launchers that were aimed at Israeli territory.

Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant said the attacks had weakened Hezbollah and would continue. These are all severe blows,” he told Israeli troops.

He accused the UN of shirking its responsibility to prevent Hezbollah’s attacks into Israel.

The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, vowed to maintain the offensive against Hezbollah and said the group’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, was leading [Lebanon](https://www.theguardian.com/world/lebanon)
 “to the edge of the abyss”.

Hezbollah said it launched rockets at the Dado military base in northern Israel and attacked the Atlit naval base south of Haifa with drones, among other targets. Even if they kill, dissect and destroy us,” he said.

 between Israel and Hezbollah in almost a year of war in Gaza, as the Lebanese militant group fired projectiles deeper into Israeli territory than has previously been seen and Israel fired hundreds of projectiles into southern Lebanon.

It came as Israel made a new war objective to [return displaced residents to](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/lebanon-pagers-explode-hezbollah-israel-09-18-24-intl-hnk#h_daeba36f8733e65bb8fc317bb402aa5a)
 their homes near the northern border after being evacuated due to Hezbollah attacks.

On Monday, Netanyahu said Israel was changing the “security balance” of power in the north, and separately told the security cabinet the country’s aim in Lebanon is to cut “Hezbollah from the war with Hamas,” an Israeli official told CNN.

Though weakened militarily and its secretive lines of communication exposed, Hezbollah’s second-in-command has declared “a new chapter” in the confrontations which he called “a battle without limits.”

Are Lebanon and Israel at war?
------------------------------

While the airstrikes, attacks and rhetoric from both Israel and Hezbollah suggest they are in open conflict, neither side is calling the current escalation a war.

The head of Israel’s military Herzi Halevi said it is “preparing for the next phases” and Netanyahu in a televised speech told the people of Lebanon that his country is not at war with them, but with Hezbollah.

Iran has warned Israel of “dangerous consequences” following the strikes, with [Iran’s president telling CNN](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-09-24-24-intl-hnk#h_6235e84528435077b1e776d2156ad1be)
 on Monday that it risks tipping the region into wider conflict.

CNN  — 

Israel launched an [intense barrage of airstrikes](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-09-24-24-intl-hnk/index.html)
 across swathes of Lebanon on Monday in what was the deadliest day for the country since at least the 2006 war fought between Israel and the powerful Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah.

Terror and despair gripped Lebanese residents as Israeli bombs killed more than 500 people, including women and children, and wounded more than 1,800 others, authorities said, as residents fled their homes desperate to reach safety.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country is changing the “balance of power” on its northern front as its military said it struck 1,600 Hezbollah assets across Lebanon on Monday, followed by more strikes the following day, and has not ruled out the possibility of a ground invasion.

On Tuesday, Hezbollah confirmed the death of one of its senior commanders, Ibrahim Qubaisi. A CNN team at a nearby hospital said they could hear sirens as first responders rushed to the scene.

Were civilians targeted?
------------------------

Israel said it was targeting Hezbollah infrastructure, but video shows destruction of residential areas and the large death toll reflects the scale and intensity of the strikes.

The nearly 500 killed on Monday alone is roughly half the number of Lebanese killed throughout the entire 34-day war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006.

Israeli warplanes were also seen flying over different parts of the country late afternoon, including over Mount Lebanon where Hezbollah does not have a notable presence.

Lebanon’s representative to the United Nations General Assembly said there was a mass “exodus” of people fleeing. Reuters video  from the southern suburbs of Beirut showed debris from damaged buildings and shards of glass littering the ground.

More than 16,500 people have been displaced in Lebanon by the Israeli strikes, the country’s coordinator of government’s emergency preparedness told CNN Tuesday.

Why is Israel attacking Lebanon?
--------------------------------

Hezbollah and Israel have been in conflict for decades – but the two have ramped up their cross-border attacks on each other since last October, when Israel’s war in Gaza began following the Palestinian militant group Hamas’ deadly October 7 attack on Israel.

Hezbollah is part of a Tehran-led alliance spanning Yemen, Syria, Gaza, and Iraq that has attacked Israel and its allies since the war with Hamas began. President Joe Biden addresses the Economic Club of Washington D.C., in Washington, U.S., September 19, 2024.\

There is a renewed effort from the international community to de-escalate the situation. Qatar, one of the key mediators in talks between Israel and Hamas, said the region is on the “brink of the abyss” and France has requested an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council to address the strikes.

Former US Defense Secretary and ex-CIA chief Leon Panetta told CNN the situation has “crossed a threshold” and warned that “we’re clearly walking into a much wider war.”

--------------

On Monday, Israel intensified its air campaign on Hezbollah, launching “extensive strikes” targeting the Iran-backed militant group in Lebanon. It is unclear how many of the casualties were civilians or Hezbollah militants, but many of the locations described by Israel as Hezbollah targets are also residential neighborhoods and villages.

Israel said that among the Hezbollah targets were “cruise missiles” that had a reach of hundreds of kilometers, rockets, and explosive warheads, according to military spokesperson Daniel Hagari, who claimed the munitions were stored in civilian homes.

Second wave of Lebanon device explosions kills 20 and wounds 450

! <image:1715>!AFP People and first responders gather at the scene of a reported device explosion in Sidon, in southern Lebanon (18 September 2024) <image:1716>AFP

Explosions were reported in southern Lebanon, including the city of Sidon, as well as Beirut's southern suburbs and the Bekaa Valley

At least 20 people have been killed and more than 450 wounded by a second wave of explosions from wireless communication devices in Lebanon, the country’s health ministry says.

Walkie-talkies used by the armed group Hezbollah blew up in the southern suburbs of the capital Beirut, the Bekaa Valley, and southern Lebanon - areas seen as its strongholds.

Some of the blasts took place during funerals for some of the 12 people who the ministry said were killed when Hezbollah members’ pagers exploded on Tuesday. <image:1715>!Reuters Mourners carry the coffin of Hezbollah fighter Mohammed Ammar, son of Hezbollah MP Ali Ammar, during his funeral in Beirut, Lebanon (18 September 2024) <image:1718>Reuters

Some of the blasts took place during funerals for some of the 12 people killed by exploding pagers on Tuesday, who included Hezbollah fighter Mohammed Ammar

Wednesday's deadly explosions represent another humiliation for Hezbollah and a possible indication that its entire communication network might have been infiltrated by Israel.

Many Lebanese are still shocked - and angered - by what happened on Tuesday, when thousands of pagers exploded at the same time, after people received a message they believed had come from the group.

Twelve people - including an eight-year-old girl and an 11-year-old boy - were killed and 2,800 others were wounded by the blasts, according to the Lebanese health minister.

A BBC team was at a funeral for four of those killed in the southern Beirut suburb of Dahiya on Wednesday when they heard a loud explosion around 17:00 local time (14:00 GMT).

There was chaos and confusion among the mourners, and then reports started to come in of explosions happening in other parts of the country as well.

[One unconfirmed social media video showed a man falling to the ground following a small blast](https://x.com/lbci_news/status/1836419137385492606)
 during what appeared to be a Hezbollah procession attended by large crowds.

The Lebanese Red Cross said more than 30 ambulances had responded to explosions in the capital’s southern suburbs, as well as in southern Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley.

The health ministry said the deadly explosions "targeted walkie-talkies". <image:1715>!Getty Images Remains of an ICOM walkie talkie following an explosion at a house on the outskirts of Baalbek, in the Bekaa Valley, Lebanon (18 September 2024) <image:1720>Getty Images

An ICOM-branded walkie talkie was destroyed by a blast at a house on the outskirts of Baalbek

Reuters news agency cited a Lebanese security source as saying the walkie-talkies were purchased by Hezbollah five months ago - around the same time as the pagers were bought.

[The Axios news website cited two sources as saying that Israeli intelligence services had booby-trapped thousands of walkie-talkies](https://www.axios.com/2024/09/18/israel-detonates-hezbollah-walkie-talkies-second-wave-after-pager-attack)
 before delivering them to Hezbollah as part of the group’s war-time emergency communications system.

The BBC asked ICOM's UK arm to comment on the reports, but it referred all media requests to the company's press office in Japan. Israel has not commented.

The attacks came as Israel's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant announced a "new phase in the war" and as an Israeli army division was redeployed to the north.

UN Secretary General António Guterres warned of the “serious risk of a dramatic escalation” and called on all parties to “exercise maximum restraint”.

"Obviously the logic of making all these devices explode is to do it as a pre-emptive strike before a major military operation," he told reporters.

[How the Hezbollah exploding device attacks unfolded\
---------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/videos/cy80nwggdz8o)

There were already rising fears of an all-out conflict after 11 months of cross-border fighting sparked by the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.

Hours after Wednesday’s explosions, Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to return the tens of thousands of displaced people from the north of the country “securely to their homes”.

Defence Minister Yoav Gallant meanwhile said Israel was “opening a new phase in the war” and that the “centre of gravity is shifting to the north through the diversion of resources and forces”.

An army division recently engaged in Gaza has been redeployed to the north, the Israeli military confirmed.

Hezbollah says it is acting in support of Hamas - which is also backed by Iran and proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel and many Western countries - and will only stop its cross-border attacks once the fighting in Gaza ends.

An indication of what the group might be planning to do next could come on Thursday, when its powerful leader, Hassan Nasrallah, is due to give a speech.

Hezbollah's media office on Wednesday announced the death of 13 of its fighters, including a 16-year-old boy, since the second wave of explosions.

It also said the group targeted Israeli forces near the border and in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights during the day, firing rockets at Israeli artillery positions.

The Israeli military said about 30 projectiles crossed from Lebanon on Wednesday, sparking a fire but causing no injuries.

It said Israeli aircraft struck Hezbollah fighters in southern Lebanon.

! A source close to Hezbollah also told AFP news agency that walkie-talkies used by its members had blown up.

Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency (NNA) said one man was killed when a walkie-talkie exploded inside a shop selling cellular devices in Chaat, in the northern Bekaa Valley.

It identified the device as an ICOM-V82 handheld VHF radio, which is a now-discontinued model made by the Japan-based electronics manufacturer ICOM.

NNA said another ICOM-V82 exploded at a house on the outskirts of the nearby town of Baalbek. I believe the number of casualties and the type of damage that has been done is humongous," Dr Elias Warrak said.

"Unfortunately, we were not able to save a lot of eyes, and unfortunately the damage is not limited to the eyes - some of them have damage in the brain in addition to any facial damage.”

Top UN official appeals for calm following wave of pager explosions in Lebanon
==============================================================================

17 September 2024 [Peace and Security](/en/news/topic/peace-and-security)

The UN Special Coordinator for Lebanon, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, has called for calm following attacks across the country on Tuesday which killed at least nine people, including children, and left thousands injured - many critically. 

The coordinated attacks reportedly targeted the Hezbollah militant group, with hundreds of electronic pagers belonging to its members blowing up at the same time, according to international media reports. 

**‘Extremely concerning escalation’** 
--------------------------------------

“**The developments today mark an extremely concerning escalation in what is an already unacceptably volatile context**,” Ms. Hennis-Plasschaert said in [a statement](https://unscol.unmissions.org/statement-un-special-coordinator-jeanine-hennis-plasschaert-attack-lebanon-0)
. 

In line with international law, she reminded all “concerned actors that **civilians are not a target and must be protected at all times**,” stressing that “even one civilian casualty is one too many.” 

While the full impact of the attack is still unfolding, she urged all concerned “to refrain from any further action, or bellicose rhetoric, which could trigger a wider conflagration that nobody can afford.” 

The Special Coordinator concluded her statement by underlining the urgency of restoring calm and called on all concerned actors to prioritize stability as paramount, because “too much is at stake to do anything less.” 

World Health Organization assisting overwhelmed hospitals
---------------------------------------------------------

The UN World Health Organization ([WHO](http://www.who.int/en/)
) in Lebanon [tweeted that](https://twitter.com/WHOLebanon/status/1836108743949365360)
 it was assisting hospitals during "the current emergency" resulting from the pager detonations because of the surge in injuries seeking medical help.

"Alongside today's health supplies, WHO previously provided trauma and other medical supplies" to Lebanon's Ministry of Public Health, to provide continued healthcare for those in need.

**(DEFENCE SECURITY ASIA) — A report by an Israeli newspaper Maariv has estimated that more than 500 Israeli military armored vehicles have been damaged by Palestinian fighters since the conflict in the Gaza Strip began in October last year.**

**The Hebrew-language newspaper stated that several dozen of these damaged armored vehicles are beyond repair and have been decommissioned from the nation’s military service.**

**The Israeli military has established two logistics centers within the Gaza Strip to repair its vehicles damaged in the conflict with Palestinian fighters, including armored cars and tanks.**

**Maariv also reported that the soldiers responsible for transporting these vehicles to the Gaza Strip are under significant physical and mental stress.**

**“If Israeli soldiers are called to fight in southern Lebanon, they will be there, but they will not be in good condition,” the newspaper added.**

**Tensions along the Lebanon-Israel border have recently escalated, leading many to predict that a war between the Israeli military and Hezbollah fighters could erupt at any time.**

**In December last year, international defense observers reported that since the armed conflict began on October 7 between Palestinian and Hezbollah fighters and the Israeli military, a total of 335 various Israeli military vehicles have been reported destroyed or damaged in the fighting so far.**

 **These vehicles include armored cars, tanks, helicopters, buses, tankers, and others, affected by the battles in Gaza, Israel, and southern Lebanon.**

**Previously, Defence Security Asia reported that satellite images from northern Gaza showed that 88 Israeli military armored vehicles and tanks were destroyed or severely damaged by anti-tank weapons fired by small Palestinian fighter units.**

**The international defense observers monitoring the situation in Gaza stated that this number represents 23 percent of the 383 Israeli military armored vehicles detected by satellites in action in northern Gaza.**

**The successes of Al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas, and Hezbollah fighters in destroying and severely damaging the Israeli military’s Merkava armored vehicles and tanks have been acknowledged by international defense observers.**

**The high rate of destruction and damage to Israeli military armored vehicles in northern Gaza aligns with reports of casualties and injuries among Israeli armor unit officers and soldiers, as reported by Israeli media.**

**Meanwhile, reports also indicate that the current conflict between Palestine and Israel has led to economic losses for Israel amounting to $48 billion (RM216 billion) for this year and the next.**

 **Leader Capital Market reported that the Israeli government would bear two-thirds of the total war costs, with the remaining one-third covered by U.S. military aid.**

**The Israeli Ministry of Finance also stated that the ongoing conflict is costing the country $270 million (RM1.2 billion) daily to conduct the war.**

 **This warfare means the Israeli government must borrow from external sources to finance its economy, which has been severely affected by the war. — DSA**

Hamas Destroying Israeli Tanks with Improvised Missile
======================================================

##### Hamas adapted Yasin 105, originally designed for armored vehicles, into a threat to Israeli Merkava tanks, drawing inspiration from Russian 'Tandem 85'.

![Hamas Destroying Israeli Tanks with Improvised Missile](https://www.defensemirror.com/uploads//news/big/4_1699458556.jpg "Hamas' Izz el-Deen al-Qassam Brigade destroys Israeli tank in Gaza strip @IRNA")

Hamas' Izz el-Deen al-Qassam Brigade destroys Israeli tank in Gaza strip @IRNA

Hamas engineers have worked on the Russia-origin Yasin 105 anti-tank rocket over the years to transform it from an armored vehicle destroyer to a weapon capable of destroying Israeli Merkava tanks.

These rockets were first used in the “Al-Aqsa Flood” battle, launched against settlements in the Gaza Strip on October 7, and have proven to be highly effective, according to [Jordan News](https://www.jordannews.jo/Section-20/Middle-East/Origins-of-the-Yasin-105-the-missile-destroying-Israeli-tanks-32075)
.

The Yasin 105 rocket was developed by the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, the armed branch of Hamas in Gaza. It was inspired by the Russian “Tandem 85” rocket, which Hamas first used in the “Al-Furqan” battle in January 2009. They targeted and destroyed an Israeli armored vehicle east of Jabalia town in northern Gaza. The resistance employed a Russian-made version of the “Tandem 85” rocket in the “Al-Asif Al-Ma’kul” battle in July 2014, and it showed its power by demolishing nine Israeli tanks. The Qassam Brigades declared in February 2017 that they had created a local version of the “Tandem 85” rocket, calling it the “Yasin 105”. They said they had made enhancements that increased its precision and performance against tanks and armored vehicles in general.

The Yasin 105 shell has a dual warhead design, making it effective against heavily armored vehicles. Launched from an RPG launcher, it can penetrate armor, destroy a vehicle from the inside, and has an effective range of 150 meters. Weighing 4.5 kilograms, it offers ground forces a deadly and efficient option, capable of penetrating solid iron up to 60 centimeters after breaching the outer armor.

Iranian state-owned [IRNA](https://en.irna.ir/news/85284865/Al-Qassam-Brigades-destroy-one-armored-vehicle-one-tank) reported the Al-Qassam Brigades declared that they had hit a Zionist military vehicle with the Al-Yassin 105MM anti-armour missile.

The Izz el-Deen al-Qassam Brigades also claimed on Tuesday that they had demolished 15 Israeli tanks and military vehicles using anti-armor shells in Beit Hanoun, a town in the northern Gaza Strip.

The Defensemirror.com article states that the image is credited to IRNA and that the Yasin 105 missile was first used in the "Al-Aqsa Flood" battle on October 7.


# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim states that the image shows an Israeli tank unit near Jabalia camp in northern Gaza that was successfully ambushed by Hamas fighters in October 2024. However, the evidence indicates that the image was published on November 8, 2023, by Defensemirror.com, which discusses Hamas's use of the Yasin 105 missile to destroy Israeli tanks. The article credits the image to IRNA and states that the Yasin 105 missile was first used on October 7.

The evidence contradicts the claim's date of October 2024, as the image was published in November 2023. The evidence also does not mention the location of the tank near Jabalia camp or the ambush by Hamas fighters.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.

 (PRCS) to ask for help while noting that they were being attacked by an Israeli tank. [American student protestors](/wiki/List_of_pro-Palestinian_protests_on_university_campuses_in_the_United_States_in_2024 "List of pro-Palestinian protests on university campuses in the United States in 2024")

, drawing increased attention to the incident.

Background
----------

By November 2023, a month after the [Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip](/wiki/Israeli_invasion_of_the_Gaza_Strip "Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip")
, much of Gaza was largely deserted and [bombed-out](/wiki/Israeli_bombing_of_the_Gaza_Strip "Israeli bombing of the Gaza Strip")
.[\[9\]](#cite_note-10)
 By December 2023, the [healthcare system](/wiki/Healthcare_in_the_State_of_Palestine "Healthcare in the State of Palestine")
 in Gaza was collapsing due to [Israeli attacks](/wiki/Attacks_on_health_facilities_during_the_Gaza_war "Attacks on health facilities during the Gaza war")
 and a [blockade of humanitarian aid](/wiki/Humanitarian_aid_during_the_Gaza_war "Humanitarian aid during the Gaza war")
.[\[10\]](#cite_note-11)
 Northern Gaza was particularly affected, as there were no functioning hospitals in the area by December due to lack of supplies, fuel and staff.[\[11\]](#cite_note-12)

Killing
-------

On 29 January 2024, Rajab along with six of her family members were fleeing from the Gaza City neighborhood of [Tel al-Hawa](/wiki/Tel_al-Hawa "Tel al-Hawa")
,[\[12\]](#cite_note-13)
[\[13\]](#cite_note-NBC2.11.24-14)
 when an Israeli army tank shot their vehicle, a black [Kia](/wiki/Kia "Kia")
, killing Rajab's aunt, uncle, and four cousins.[\[14\]](#cite_note-15)
 The only other survivor, Rajab's 15-year-old cousin Layan Hamadeh, called the [Palestinian Red Crescent Society](/wiki/Palestinian_Red_Crescent_Society "Palestinian Red Crescent Society")
 (PRCS) for emergency aid. That’s exactly what Israel wants](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/aug/18/hind-rajab-israeli-state-atrocity)

**Palestinian Territory** - The Israeli army continues to use its tanks to deliberately run over live Palestinian civilians and crush their bodies, in addition to using civilians as human shields, in the ground operations of its crime of genocide in the Gaza Strip that has been ongoing since 7 October 2023.

The Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor field team documented a compound and comprehensive crime against a civilian family comprising an elderly woman and her four children, including three young women and a one-and-a-half-year-old granddaughter. Most of these tank attacks have targeted vehicles with no evident military connection, parked in the streets, demonstrating the Israeli army’s deliberate and systematic destruction of Palestinian property.

These violations are part of a larger Israeli effort to dehumanise every Palestinian in the Gaza Strip, apparently in an attempt to justify and normalise the crimes being committed against them. Crushing civilians with tanks is just one of the many brutal ways the Israeli army executes Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, denying their humanity, suffering, and dignity. No one was following us until we got to the Baptist Hospital."

Euro-Med Monitor has previously documented many instances of the Israeli army killing Palestinian civilians by intentionally running over live civilians with military tanks.

Sixty-two-year-old Jamal Hamdi Hassan Ashour was one such victim. The corpses of those who had been previously buried in the courtyard were also crushed in the 16 December incident.

Euro-Med Monitor has also documented numerous incidents of Israeli army tanks destroying civilian property, particularly cars, during Israel’s ground incursions into different parts of the Gaza Strip. These crimes come in tandem with a public incitement campaign by Israeli officials, media figures, and settlers calling for the annihilation of Palestinians in Gaza, and are committed with total impunity by the perpetrators—which is evident in the absence of any meaningful action by the Israeli government or military at any level to hold the perpetrators accountable.

Israeli military attacks continue in various parts of the Gaza Strip, with ongoing aerial and artillery bombardment targeting residential homes. The Israeli army has also escalated its targeted killings, and extrajudicial executions against Palestinian civilians since 7 October 2023 through direct targeting with snipers, drones, and continuing operations in various regions of the Gaza Strip. These actions against civilians amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity under the Rome Statute, and are all part of the Israeli crime of genocide that has been ongoing in the Gaza Strip since 7 October.

The widespread and indiscriminate destruction of property caused by the Israeli army, as observed in the Shujaiya neighbourhood east of Gaza City, Rafah, Khan Yunis, and Jabalia north of the Gaza Strip, affecting over 65% of the buildings, is also considered a war crime under the Rome Statute.

The international community must take immediate action to fulfil its international obligations to put an end to the crime of genocide that Israel has been committing against all Palestinians in the Gaza Strip for nine months. They were later taken outside and detained for over three hours despite their injuries in their home, near Israeli tanks in a dangerous combat zone, where they were used as human shields. The 65-year-old mother, identified as Safiya Hassan Musa Al-Jamal, was run over by an Israeli tank and killed in front of her son.

DEIR AL BALAH, Gaza Strip — Israeli troops opened fire Saturday toward crowds of Palestinians seeking food from distribution hubs run by a U.S.- and Israeli-backed group in southern Gaza, killing at least 32 people, according to witnesses and hospital officials.

The shootings occurred near hubs operated by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which launched operations in May. Seven other people, including one woman, were killed in the Shakoush area, hundreds of meters or yards north of another GHF hub in Rafah, the hospital said.

Palestinians who were injured during a food distribution at a center run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a U.S.-backed organization approved by Israel, receive treatment on the floor of Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, southern Gaza Strip, Saturday, July 19, 2025. denies the allegation.

While GHF says it has distributed millions of meals to hungry Palestinians, local health officials and witnesses say Israeli army fire has killed hundreds of people as they try to reach the hubs. Two children, including an infant, and five women — all relatives of Aqel — were among the dead.

Al-Awda Hospital said that it also received two people killed by an Israeli strike on a group of people in Bureij, and that another strike on a group of people along Salah El Din street in central Gaza killed a child.

Another strike on a house in the Gaza City neighborhood of Sheikh Radwan killed at least four people, according to the Health Ministry's ambulance and emergency service. A strike on a cart in Tal al-Hawa in northern Gaza killed another four people, the service said.

Israel's army had no comment on specific strikes, but said that it had struck around 90 targets throughout Gaza over the past day.

### Humanitarian crisis

Gaza's population of more than 2 million Palestinians are in a catastrophic humanitarian crisis. Fifty remain, but fewer than half are thought to be alive.

Israel's military offensive has killed more than 58,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which doesn't say how many militants are among the dead. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee visited the Palestinian Christian village, Taybeh, where residents say extremist Israeli settlers set fire to the Church of St. Palestinians say Israeli security forces have done little to stop the violence, and few settlers have been punished.

```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results include articles discussing the killing of a Palestinian girl by Israeli forces in Gaza on January 29, 2024, as reported on Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Hind_Rajab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Hind_Rajab)). Another article from Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor, published on June 30, 2024, discusses the Israeli army's actions in Gaza ([https://euromedmonitor.org/en/article/6385/A-compound-crime:-Israeli-army-hits-Gaza-family,-uses-them-as-human-shields,-and-runs-over-their-mother](https://euromedmonitor.org/en/article/6385/A-compound-crime:-Israeli-army-hits-Gaza-family,-uses-them-as-human-shields,-and-runs-over-their-mother)).

NPR reported on July 19, 2025, that 32 Palestinians were killed by Israeli troops while trying to reach food distribution hubs in Gaza ([https://www.npr.org/2025/07/19/g-s1-78420/palestinians-food-aid-deaths](https://www.npr.org/2025/07/19/g-s1-78420/palestinians-food-aid-deaths)). <image:36>

## Elaboration
The evidence provides information about events in Gaza, including the killing of a Palestinian girl in January 2024 ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Hind_Rajab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Hind_Rajab)), actions by the Israeli army in June 2024 ([https://euromedmonitor.org/en/article/6385/A-compound-crime:-Israeli-army-hits-Gaza-family,-uses-them-as-human-shields,-and-runs-over-their-mother](https://euromedmonitor.org/en/article/6385/A-compound-crime:-Israeli-army-hits-Gaza-family,-uses-them-as-human-shields,-and-runs-over-their-mother)), and the killing of Palestinians in July 2025 ([https://www.npr.org/2025/07/19/g-s1-78420/palestinians-food-aid-deaths](https://www.npr.org/2025/07/19/g-s1-78420/palestinians-food-aid-deaths)).

The evidence does not directly verify the claim about the image. It does not mention the image or its context.

To verify the claim, information about the image's origin, the tank's identification, and the woman's identity is missing.


## Actions
```
image_search("tank drying clothes Gaza")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
Al Jazeera published an article on November 25, 2024, about flooding in Gaza, which includes a photograph of a woman near a tent (<image:1741>

## Elaboration
The new evidence provides an image of a woman near a tent in Gaza, but it does not contain any information about the tank in the original claim. Therefore, the claim remains unverified.

### Evidence from `image_search`
The Wire published an article about a march in Kolkata against the "genocide in Palestine" in 2023, organized by left parties.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that the image is likely from a protest in Kolkata, India, as indicated by the `geolocate` results and confirmed by the image search results. The image search results also show that there were pro-Palestine protests in Kolkata. However, the exact location within Kolkata and the date (April 2025) mentioned in the claim are not confirmed by the evidence.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported. The location and the cause of the protest are likely correct, but the specific location (Sohrawardi Park) and the date (April 2025) are not verified.

Social media accounts posted [a photo](https://www.instagram.com/p/DISBVcfsfgU/)
 of two young children appearing as skeletons, claiming that the image shows two children found two months later under the rubble of their home in the Gaza Strip. The caption for the photo reads, “Two children found two months later under the rubble of their home.” Share, don’t just remain silent.

Kashif verified the image via Google Images search and found it to be old and the claim misleading. The image depicts two Spanish mummified children inside a museum in Bolivia, not two children found under rubble in the Gaza Strip.

Six hundred days after the start of the war in Gaza, Edouard Beigbeder, UNICEF Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa, asks, 'How many more dead girls and boys will it take?"

Since the end of the ceasefire on March 18, 1,309 children have reportedly been killed and 3,738 injured in Gaza. Days later, a small child was trapped in a burning school in Gaza City; at least 31 people, including 18 children, were reported dead.

UNICEF stays to deliver for children in Gaza
--------------------------------------------

Despite the extremely challenging circumstances, UNICEF staff remain present on the ground in the Gaza Strip, delivering supplies and essential services where they are most needed.

UNICEF continues to screen and treat children for malnutrition, and to distribute multipurpose cash assistance to help families purchase food and medicines, when they are available in the market.

UNICEF is also supporting critical water, sanitation and hygiene services, including the delivery of safe drinking water to 1.5 million people. Sustained support is needed from donors to reach every child in need.

> On Sunday, UNICEF and partners reached 800 children with nutrition support at a malnutrition treatment point in Khan Yunis. Our colleagues are doing whatever it takes to help children in #Gaza — but the supplies getting through aren't nearly enough to meet their urgent needs. "What level of horror must be live streamed before the international community fully steps up, uses its influence, and takes bold, decisive action to force the end of this ruthless killing of children?" 

“The children of Gaza need protection," Beigbeder continued. But more than anything, they need immediate, collective action to stop this once and for all.”

Content: "Health officials said most of the victims were women and children.

The strike that destroyed the infant girl’s home hit Abasan al-Kabira, a village just outside of Khan Younis near the border with Israel, killing at least 16 people, mostly women and children, according to the nearby European Hospital, which received the dead.

It was inside an area the Israeli military ordered evacuated earlier this week, encompassing most of eastern Gaza.

Nabil Abu Dagga, a relative of Ella’s family who lives nearby, rushed to the scene of the strike.

“People were sitting together and enjoying themselves on a Ramadan night, staying up together as a family,” he said. [PBS News](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/ "PBS News")

Month-old girl pulled from rubble in Gaza after airstrike killed her parents
============================================================================

[World](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world)
 Mar 20, 2025 3:02 PM EDT

KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip (AP) — As rescuers dug through the remains of a collapsed apartment building in Gaza’s Khan Younis on Thursday, they could hear the cries of a baby from underneath the rubble.

Suddenly, calls of “God is great” rang out. We never felt that there was stability, not at all.”

**READ MORE:** [Israeli strikes across Gaza hit multiple homes, killing at least 85 Palestinians](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/israeli-strikes-across-gaza-hit-multiple-homes-killing-at-least-85-palestinians)

Israel resumed heavy strikes across Gaza on Tuesday, shattering the truce that had facilitated the release of more than two dozen hostages. The military did not immediately comment on the overnight strikes.

Hours later, the Israeli military restored a blockade on northern Gaza, including Gaza City, that it had maintained for most of the war, but which had been lifted under the ceasefire deal.

Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians had returned to what remains of their homes in the north after a ceasefire took hold in January.

The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostage.

Israel’s blistering retaliatory air and ground offensive has killed nearly 49,000 Palestinians since then, more than half of them women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. The baby girl stirred fitfully as paramedics checked her over.

Her parents and brother were dead in the overnight Israeli airstrike.

“When we asked people, they said she is a month old and she has been under the rubble, since dawn,” said Hazen Attar, a civil defense first responder. She had been born 25 days earlier, in the midst of a tenuous ceasefire that many Palestinians in Gaza had hoped would mark the end of a war that has devastated the enclave, killed tens of thousands and displaced nearly its entire population.

Only the girl’s grandparents survived the attack. Killed were her brother, mother and father, along with another family that included a father and his seven children. Rescuers digging through the rubble could be seen pulling out the small body of a child sprawled on the mattress where he had been sleeping.

The girl’s grandmother, Fatima Abu Dagga, sat with a group of other women in a relative’s house Thursday, taking turns cradling the infant. Her sons and their wives and eight grandchildren died in the bombing, and only the baby survived."

**ISTANBUL**

Iranian Brigadier General Esmail Qaani, the commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' (IRGC) Quds Force, was seen alive and well during celebrations Tuesday in Tehran of Iran's self-claimed victory over Israel, according to local media.

A video posted by Iran’s Tasnim News Agency showed Qaani among the crowd at the event.

“Commander Qaani attends today’s gathering of the people of Tehran following Operation Divine Victory,” the agency said on X.

State-funded Press TV also published the video, saying: “Brigadier General Esmail Qaani, Commander of the IRGC Quds Force, was warmly received by a jubilant crowd in Tehran during victory celebrations over the Zionist (Israeli) regime.”

Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Qaani was among the Iranian military leaders killed in Israeli strikes.

Israel launched airstrikes on several sites across Iran since June 13, including military and nuclear facilities, alleging that Tehran was on the verge of producing a nuclear bomb, a claim vehemently denied by Iran.

While Iran launched retaliatory missile and drone strikes, the US joined the conflict by bombing three Iranian nuclear sites on Sunday.

After 12 days of aerial combat between the two regional arch-foes, US President Donald Trump announced overnight a ceasefire between Israel and Iran to end their conflict. **Please contact us for subscription options.**](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/p/subscription/1001)

“Breaking: Iran’s

IRGC Quds Force commander Gen. (Photo by JOE KLAMAR/AFP via Getty Images) ©(Photo by JOE KLAMAR/AFP via Getty Images)

A post [shared on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=2675716869304453&id=100005984985043)
 claims an Iranian general fled to Israel.

**Verdict: False**

There is no evidence for this claim.

**Fact Check:**

Social media users are claiming that Iranian Gen. Esmail Qaani is confirmed safe in Israel

It can now be revealed that he was an Israeli asset, providing intelligence that led to elimination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, and Hezbollah leaders Nasrallah and Safieddine,” reads one user’s post.

This claim is false. No media outlets have reported that Qaani has defected to Israel. The Israel Defense Forces nor any Israeli government entity has confirmed that Qaani provided intelligence. The outlet reported that while Qaani was under investigation in connection to Nasrallah’s death, he was seen at “rallies commemorating the anniversary of the Islamic Revolution” in February 2025.

The Daily Caller published an article on April 7, 2025, debunking the claim that Qaani fled to Israel, stating there is no evidence to support this claim. (<image:1763>) The article mentions Qaani was seen at rallies in February 2025.


## Elaboration
The evidence contradicts the claim. The Daily Caller debunked the claim on April 7, 2025, stating there was no evidence to support it. Furthermore, an Anadolu Agency article from June 25, 2025, reported that Qaani was seen alive in Tehran.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that the claim is false. Multiple sources, including The Daily Caller and Anadolu Agency, contradict the claim that Gen. Esmail Qaani fled Iran and is safe in Israel. The Daily Caller debunked the claim in April 2025, and the Anadolu Agency reported Qaani was seen alive in Tehran in June 2025.

`false`

Cease-fire in Lebanon and Gaza\
------------------------------](/portfolio/927-hamas-israel-war)

After the Israeli strike of Wednesday night on a small building in Nabatieh, residents woke up in disbelief at what happened, according to testimonies given to L'Orient Today's correspondent in the area.

The Israeli air force targeted the western part of the city, amid the daily and escalating exchanges of fire between Hezbollah and the Israeli army along the Lebanese-Israeli border.

At least two missiles were fired at the two- or three-story building, according to security sources, residents, and rescuers whose testimonies were collected by our correspondent in the region.

On Thursday morning, Hussein Faqih, Head of the Civil Defence Centre in the Nabatieh Regional Centre, told L'Orient Today that the rescue operations in the destroyed building were concluded and that nine people suffered from injuries he qualified as "medium to light."

Others suffered from smoke inhalation caused by the explosions and loss of consciousness, according to Faqih.

The Civil Defense was deployed on-site, along with the Red Cross, al-Rissala scouts (affiliated with the Amal movement), and the Islamic Health Committee (affiliated with Hezbollah).

The building, located on an intersection in the northwestern area of Nabatieh called Hay al-Bayad, was completely destroyed, Faqih added, explaining that "dozens of close-by houses have been damaged, as well as dozens of cars."

According to our correspondent, Nabatieh had previously been targeted by drones, but never by the Israeli air force, which had, until now, targeted only the city’s outskirts.

Speaking to L'Orient Today, Iqbal Marwa, a supermarket owner in her fifties from the Al-Bayad neighborhood, said the balcony railings and doors in her house, just a few hundred meters from the airstrike, were shaking from the impact.

"I was on my balcony drinking coffee when I heard the sound of a missile being launched. Immediately after, I heard a huge explosion. Screams rose from the neighboring houses, and people went out onto their balconies, wondering where the explosion had occurred," she said.

"I did not expect my city to be bombed in this way. To be honest, I did not expect my house to be in the danger zone, yet I was not afraid," she said, ensuring that she intends to "stay in my home."

She explained she went to the site of the strike this morning and was "shocked by the extent of the destruction."

Faten Sabah, who was also close to the airstrike, told L'Orient Today that when she heard the sound of the fighter jets and "a sonic boom," she "took cover in a corner of the room and asked my daughter to take cover as well, fearing the windows would shatter."

"As soon as I said that, a massive explosion echoed for a few seconds, shaking the walls and doors."

"I will not leave my house because of one raid, and neither will my neighbors. This is what they said this morning. We agreed not to leave our homes and to monitor how the situation develops," Sabah said. She added sarcastically, "Where would we go with our pockets empty of money?"

In mid-February, notably, seven civilians from the same family were killed in a drone strike in Nabatieh. The Israeli army said the attack was conducted in retaliation for unclaimed rocket fire from Lebanon that hit a military base in northern Israel and killed one soldier.

وكانت وكالة الأنباء اللبنانية الرسمية قد أشارت إلى إلقاء مسيّرة إسرائيلية قنابل حارقة في مشروع عرب الثمار  الزراعي، خلف تلة الحمامص في الوزاني، مما أدى إلى اشتعال النيران فيه.

من جانبه، قال [جيش الاحتلال الإسرائيلي](/news/%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D9%88%D9%82%D8%B9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%B5%D8%B9%D9%8A%D8%AF-%D9%85%D8%A7-%D9%82%D8%B5%D8%A9-%D9%81%D9%8A%D8%AF%D9%8A%D9%88-%D8%A5%D8%B1%D8%B3%D8%A7%D9%84-%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%B2%D9%8A%D8%B2%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A5%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%86%D8%AD%D9%88-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%84)
 اليوم الجمعة، إنه اعترض مسيّرة تسللت من لبنان باتجاه منطقة أصبع الجليل قرب الحدود.

بدوره، أعلن [حزب الله](/news/%D9%82%D8%B5%D9%81-%D8%A5%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D9%84%D9%8A-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D9%85%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D8%A8%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A-%D8%AD%D8%B2%D8%A8-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87-%D9%8A%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%87%D8%AF%D9%81-%D9%85%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%82%D8%B9-%D8%AD%D8%AF%D9%88%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%A9)
 اللبناني أنه قصف أجهزة تجّسس في موقع "بركة ريشا" الإسرائيلي.

وقال الحزب في بيان إن عناصره "استهدفوا الأجهزة ‏التجسسيّة في موقع بركة ريشا الإسرائيلي (قبالة بلدة البستان اللبنانية) بالأسلحة المناسبة وأصابوه إصابة مباشرة".

وكان حزب الله قد أعلن مساء الخميس أنّه قصف قاعدة عسكرية في شمال الأراضي الفلسطينية المحتلة، ردًّا على غارتين إسرائيليّتين أدّت إحداهما إلى استشهاد أحد عناصره.

وقال الحزب في بيان إنّه قصف "القاعدة الأساسية للدفاع الجوي الصاروخي التابع لقيادة المنطقة الشمالية في ثكنة بيريا بعشرات صواريخ الكاتيوشا".

وأشار إلى أنّه نفّذ هذا القصف ردًّا على "اعتداءات العدو التي طالت مدينة النبطية وبلدة سُحمر".

وإثر هذا القصف ذكر جيش الاحتلال أنّه رصد "إطلاق نحو 35 قذيفة صاروخية من لبنان، حيث اعترضت الدفاعات الجوية معظمها بدون وقوع إصابات".

### Israeli domestic politics

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faced pressure from [far-right](/wiki/Far-right_politics_in_Israel "Far-right politics in Israel")
 members of his coalition to resume war against the Gaza Strip.[\[28\]](#cite_note-PBS20250318-28)
 Throughout the war, members of Netanyahu's coalition have called for the permanent conquest of Gaza and re-establishment of Jewish settlements there.[\[44\]](#cite_note-Reuters20250318a-45)
 Netanyahu has thus far resisted those calls, and when he signed the ceasefire agreement in January, the [Israeli Security Minister](/wiki/Ministry_of_National_Security_(Israel) "Ministry of National Security (Israel)")
 [Itamar Ben-Gvir](/wiki/Itamar_Ben-Gvir "Itamar Ben-Gvir")

 Opposition members accused Netanyahu and [his government](/wiki/Thirty-seventh_government_of_Israel "Thirty-seventh government of Israel")
 of failing to eliminate Hamas and allied groups' military capabilities or to rescue the remaining [Israeli hostages](/wiki/Gaza_war_hostage_crisis "Gaza war hostage crisis")
 in Gaza.[\[45\]](#cite_note-46)

Netanyahu's critics have said that the 18 March attacks are a result of Netanyahu's legal troubles.[\[14\]](#cite_note-BBC20250318-14)
 Netanyahu was scheduled on 18 March to testify in [his corruption trial](/wiki/Trial_of_Benjamin_Netanyahu "Trial of Benjamin Netanyahu")

On 4 February 2025, Trump announced an intention to "take over" and "own" the Gaza Strip.[\[47\]](#cite_note-48)
 Trump proposed that Gaza's 2 million Palestinians be permanently relocated from the Strip.[\[48\]](#cite_note-Yahoo20250318-49)
 This plan was supported by Netanyahu but condemned by human rights experts as a violation of international law.[\[48\]](#cite_note-Yahoo20250318-49)
 The 18 March attacks were done with Trump's approval.[\[48\]](#cite_note-Yahoo20250318-49)

### Israeli army issues new displacement orders in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza

GAZA, July 20, 2025 (WAFA) — The Israeli occupation army issued new displacement orders on Sunday, demanding the evacuation of additional areas in Deir al-Balah, located in the central Gaza Strip, signaling a possible expansion of its ground offensive in the region.

The warning, accompanied by a map, outlines specific zones targeted for evacuation. These areas include makeshift camps housing displaced Palestinians who fled earlier military attacks in other parts of Gaza.

This move follows a pattern of repeated evacuation orders issued by the Israeli occupation military since March, with dozens of similar alerts previously delivered in both northern and southern Gaza.

Israel’s attacks on Gaza have killed at least 61 people since dawn, targeting civilians in crowded places as its more than two-month blockade of the besieged and bombarded enclave has caused [acute food shortages](/gallery/2025/5/4/nearly-290000-gaza-children-on-the-brink-of-death-amid-israeli-blockade)
, accelerating the starvation of the Palestinian population.

A reconnaissance drone strike targeted an area near the Thai and Palmyra restaurants on al-Wehda Street in Gaza City on Wednesday. Five were killed in a strike on one home.

Another three people, including a child, died when a tent shelter was attacked in Deir el-Balah in the central Gaza Strip. Not only are they suffering on a daily basis because of the enforced starvation and dehydration, they \[also\] try to plant their own food, but they are deprived, and their abilities to do so are \[thwarted\] by the ongoing attacks,” he added.

![[Al Jazeera]](/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Interactive_Gaza_foodaid_timeline-1742987531-1744365779.webp?w=770&resize=770%2C963&quality=80)

\[Al Jazeera\]

The intensified attacks have been compounded by an Israeli blockade on essential supplies since March 2, leaving the enclave deprived of fuel and food, including flour. Two missiles were fired at two locations at the same time, 100 metres (110 yards) apart, one inside a restaurant and another at an intersection, killing at least 17 people.

Reporting from Gaza City, Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud said the attack hit one of the few places where Palestinians are able to get a meal.

“The tables and chairs are all thrown around, and blood stains the ground as a result of severe bleeding,” Mahmoud said, reporting from a crowd of residents and street vendors examining the destruction after the attack.

At the site of the attack on the nearby intersection, Mahmoud said people were on the ground “soaked in blood and shredded into pieces”.

Another attack in Gaza City killed 13 people at al-Karama School in the Tuffah neighbourhood 

Other Israeli strikes on Wednesday were scattered across Gaza. Three people were killed and several wounded in a strike on a house in Jabalia in northern Gaza.

Another eight people – including a father, his children and cousins – were killed in the southern city of Khan Younis. At least 88 percent of beds in hospitals are occupied, and their staffs are trying to treat patients as they face shortages of medical supplies.

Ceasefire talks
---------------

On Wednesday, Egypt and Qatar, which both mediated this year’s ceasefire alongside the US, reaffirmed their commitment to an agreement aimed at ending the “​​unprecedented humanitarian crisis and alleviating the suffering of civilians by fostering the necessary conditions for achieving a comprehensive ceasefire”.

“The two countries emphasise that attempts to sow discord among brotherly nations – whether through the casting of doubt, distortion, or media escalation – will not succeed, nor will they deter the two nations from continuing their joint efforts to end the war and the resulting humanitarian catastrophe,” a joint statement read, adding that the countries were working with the US to reach a deal.

While Israel announced that a more intense [military offensive](/news/2025/5/5/israel-plans-conquest-of-gaza-in-expanded-offensive)
 would begin in Gaza unless a ceasefire was signed, Hamas said the talks were [pointless.](/news/2025/5/6/no-sense-in-gaza-ceasefire-talks-amid-israels-hunger-war-hamas)

“There is no sense in engaging in talks or considering new ceasefire proposals as long as the hunger war and extermination war continue in the Gaza Strip,” Hamas official Basem Naim told the AFP news agency on Tuesday.

The dead also included four people whose bodies were recovered from under the rubble of an Israeli attack earlier this week on a school sheltering displaced people in the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza. The Palestinian Civil Defence agency said on Tuesday night that more than 30 people had been killed and dozens wounded there.

‘Scrambling for cover’
----------------------

Mahmoud said Palestinians were “scrambling for cover” as air strikes and explosions struck residential buildings and evacuation centres across Gaza.

“We have confirmed that a farmer was killed in the eastern part of Khan Younis, in Abasan, as he was trying to harvest what he managed to plant in the past couple of months, making up for the lack of food,” Mahmoud said.

“This is one of the elements that we have been seeing quite visibly. Aid groups have said food supplies are close to total depletion.

The United States-based World Central Kitchen charity said it has halted work in the Gaza Strip after it was prevented by Israel from bringing in aid and ran out of supplies.

“After serving more than 130 million total meals and 26 million loaves of bread over the past 18 months, World Central Kitchen no longer has the supplies to cook meals or bake bread in Gaza,” it said on Wednesday in a post on X.

A mother of six sheltering at a facility run by the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) told the agency her family only had bread after they had run out of all other types of food.

“The State of Israel must lift the siege,” UNRWA wrote on X on Wednesday.

“There must be a concerted international effort to stop this humanitarian catastrophe from reaching a new unseen level,” it added.

Gaza’s health sector is also bearing the brunt of the ongoing attacks and blockade."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The new evidence provides additional images related to the Israeli attacks on Gaza, including Deir al-Balah. However, none of the images match the one in the claim. Therefore, the claim remains partially verifiable, as the evidence confirms the attacks and casualties in Deir al-Balah in March 2025, but it does not confirm that the image depicts the specific event described in the claim.

The claim is partially verifiable.

The image search did not yield a match. Therefore, the claim is `not enough information`.

## Claim
Claim: "<image:39> This image shows heavy Israeli bombardment on Deir al-Balah in the southern Gaza Strip in March 2025 which killed at least four Palestinians."

## Actions

web_search("Deir al-Balah Gaza bombing March 2025")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:39>

### Evidence from `web_search`
The March 2025 Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip began on March 18, 2025, ending the ceasefire, and targeted multiple locations, including Deir al-Balah. These attacks resulted in over 591 deaths. An article from Al Jazeera, published on May 7, 2025, reports on an attack on a tent shelter in Deir el-Balah that killed three people, including a child. <image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>, <image:l>, <image:m>, <image:n>.

WAFA reported on July 20, 2025, that the Israeli army issued new displacement orders in Deir al-Balah.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Deir al-Balah was targeted in March 2025 during Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip. The attacks resulted in casualties. An article from Al Jazeera mentions an attack on a tent shelter in Deir el-Balah that killed three people, including a child.

The claim states that the image shows heavy Israeli bombardment on Deir al-Balah in March 2025 which killed at least four Palestinians. The evidence confirms the bombardment and the casualties. However, the evidence does not confirm that the image depicts the specific event described in the claim.

Therefore, the claim is partially verifiable. More information is needed to confirm that the image depicts the specific event described in the claim.

## Elaboration
The new evidence provides additional images related to the Israeli attacks on Gaza, including Deir al-Balah. However, none of the images match the one in the claim. Therefore, the claim remains partially verifiable, as the evidence confirms the attacks and casualties in Deir al-Balah in March 2025, but it does not confirm that the image depicts the specific event described in the claim.

Israel’s attacks on Gaza have stretched into a second day after a seven-day truce with Hamas ended as Qatar and Egypt mediate talks to renew a pause in hostilities.

The United Nations said on Saturday that the fighting would worsen the extreme humanitarian emergency in Gaza.

“Hell on Earth has returned to Gaza,” said Jens Laerke, spokesperson for the UN humanitarian office in Geneva.

“Today, in a matter of hours, scores were reportedly killed and injured. Hopes were dashed,” UN aid chief Martin Griffiths said, adding that children, women and men of Gaza had “nowhere safe to go and very little to survive on”.

Al Jazeera’s Hind Khoudary in Deir el-Balah in central Gaza said Israeli tanks have not stopped shelling the enclave and gunboats are attacking its coastline.

“Houses have been targeted. Areas across the Gaza Strip – the north, south and centre – have all been targeted.”

The Israeli army said on Saturday that it hit more than 400 targets overnight, including in the Khan Younis area in the south, to which tens of thousands of civilians evacuated over the past month.

NewsOn Friday evening, as Israeli bombing intensified, Internet access was interrupted in the Palestinian enclave, suspending the flow of images for the first time since October 7.

The war between Israel and Hamas entered into its twenty-third day on Sunday, October 29. Since October 7 and the Islamist movement's terrorist attacks on Israeli soil, which have left over 1,400 people dead, the Israeli army has been relentlessly bombing the Gaza Strip, which has been controlled by Hamas since 2007 and is home to some 2.4 million Palestinians.

On Friday evening, Internet access in Gaza was interrupted, according to NetBlocks, an internet connectivity observatory. At the same time, shelling targeted the north of the enclave – in particular the areas of Jabalia, Beit Lahia and Beit Hanoun – which also suspended picture coverage from Gaza for an evening, for the first time since the start of the conflict.

These images tell the story of what has happened in the Gaza Strip since the night of October 27.

The evidence confirms that Deir al-Balah was targeted in March 2025 during Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip. The attacks resulted in casualties. An article from Al Jazeera mentions an attack on a tent shelter in Deir el-Balah that killed three people, including a child.

The claim states that the image shows heavy Israeli bombardment on Deir al-Balah in March 2025 which killed at least four Palestinians. The evidence confirms the bombardment and the casualties. However, the evidence does not confirm that the image depicts the specific event described in the claim.

Therefore, the claim is partially verifiable. More information is needed to confirm that the image depicts the specific event described in the claim.

Smoke rises after strikes on Syria's defense ministry in Damascus, according to Al Jazeera TV, in Damascus, Syria July 16, 2025.

CNN  — 

Syria and Israel have agreed to a ceasefire, US Ambassador to Turkey Tom Barrack said on Friday.

The deal was “embraced” by Turkey, Jordan and other neighboring countries, the ambassador, who also serves as the US special envoy to Syria, said in a post on X.

“We call upon Druze, Bedouins, and Sunnis to put down their weapons and together with other minorities build a new and united Syrian identity in peace and prosperity with its neighbors,” Barrack said.

Neither party immediately commented on the reported deal.

The ceasefire comes after Israel launched airstrikes at Syria on Wednesday, which Israel said were aimed at protecting the Druze, an Arab [religious minority](https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/15/middleeast/israel-strikes-syria-sectarian-clashes-druze-intl)
. One video from a Syrian television channel showed the Ministry of Defense building being hit live on air, forcing the anchor to take cover.

Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa [said](https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/16/middleeast/damascus-syria-airstrikes-intl)
 on Wednesday night local time that the Syrian army started withdrawing from Suwayda, where clashes erupted over the weekend between Druze militia and Bedouin tribes, prompting government forces to intervene. Al-Sharaa’s government also announced a new ceasefire with the Druze factions.

In that same televised address, al-Sharaa accused Israel of seeking to divide the Syrian people and turn Syria “into a battlefield of chaos.”

The US has voiced concern over the increased tensions and has made a recent diplomatic push to resolve the conflict.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio held a phone call with Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan on Friday to discuss the matter, according to a readout of the call from the Turkish foreign ministry.

Rubio previously said on Wednesday night that all parties to the conflict had agreed to “specific steps” to resolve the situation.

“This will require all parties to deliver on the commitments they have made and this is what we fully expect them to do,” Rubio said on X.

Amos Yadlin, a former major general and chief of Israeli Military Intelligence, said Friday on CNN’s “The Brief with Jim Sciutto” that that involvement of all the players – including Turkey, Israel, and Jordan – is “making a lot of sense.”

“The question is how the people on the ground will behave, whether the retaliations of the two communities will stop,” Yadlin said.

WASHINGTON, July 18 (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said steps had been agreed to end a "troubling and horrifying situation".

It also followed what appeared to be a de-escalation of the conflict after government troops withdrew from Sweida, where violence had been centered.

Turkey grapples over answer to Israel’s destabilising intervention in Syria as agendas collide
==============================================================================================

Erdogan’s display of anger shows to what extent Israel and Turkey find themselves today on opposite trajectories as their regional agendas have come to collide after after months of discrete efforts at de-confliction over their mutual goals in Syria.

Friday 18/07/2025

DAMASCUS/ ANKARA

Following Israeli strikes on Damascus and other parts of Syria, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan delivered one of his harshest diatribes against Israel.

Speaking on television, Thursday, he accused Israel of “using the Druze as an excuse” to expand  “its banditry into neighbouring Syria.”

Then went on to say, “I want to state this once again, clearly and directly: Israel is a lawless, unruly, unprincipled, spoiled, pampered, and greedy terrorist state”.

“At this stage, the biggest problem in our region is Israel’s aggression… If the monster is not stopped immediately, it will not hesitate to throw first our region, then the world, into flames.”

The same day, he called Syrian leader Ahmed al-Sharaa to reassure him of Ankara’s support.

Erdogan’s display of anger shows to what extent Israel and Turkey find themselves today on opposite trajectories as their regional agendas have come to collide after after months of discrete efforts at de-confliction over their mutual goals in Syria.

Developments compelled Ankara to deploy intensive diplomatic efforts with an eye on bolstering the precarious position of Sharaa whose rule it has consistently backed, but it has only the diplomatic option to pursue towards this end.

Speaking to the media in New York, Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said he was in close contact with Tom Barrack, US Special Envoy for Syria and the US ambassador to Turkey, and that he discussed the issue in phone calls with his Syrian, Jordanian and Saudi Arabian counterparts.

Fidan revealed in this context that Ankara has conveyed its position regarding Israel’s air strikes on Syria to Israeli authorities via its intelligence agency.

Turkey has halted all trade and recalled its ambassador in Tel Aviv for consultations, but has not severed diplomatic nor intelligence links.

According to analysts, Turkey worries about Israel’s reliance on military power to challenge Turkish influence and destabilise the Sharaa regime.

Erdogan said Turkey will not allow Syria to be divided or its multicultural structure and territorial integrity harmed.

He seems to echo Sharaa’s who has accused Israel of seeking to “dismantle the unity of our people”, saying it had “consistently targeted our stability and created discord among us since the fall of the former regime”.

Ankara’s concerns go beyond Syria. And this, perhaps more than anything, must be answered,” Jonathan Adiri, an advisor to late Israeli president Shimon Peres, wrote in Ynetnews.

“The way forward is not meekness, but deterrence, crafted not through brute confrontation but through calibrated friction and strategic clarity,” he added.

Nobody expects a Turkish-Israeli confrontation over Syria, but continued Israeli escalation could further shake Sharaa’s hold on power and create opportunities for Iranian and Jihadist resurgence in Syria.

Reflecting his country’s mix of anger and wariness, the Turkish foreign minister called on the international community on Wednesday to contain the “dangerous situation”.

“Otherwise,” he warned, “it’s safe to say that undesirable consequences will emerge in the region.”

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (R) and Syria’s interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa arrive for a joint press conference following a meeting in Ankara, on February 4, 2025. And the result is this preference for using force rather than diplomacy.”

Also and despite their normalisation talks with Damascus, the Israelis never shed their suspicion of the new Syrian rulers’ jihadist past.

At the same time, they silently resented Ankara’s push for regional influence.

This sentiment seems harboured by many Israelis, and not only on the far-right.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The Arab Weekly reported that on February 4, 2025, the Turkish President met with Syria’s interim President and called for international intervention, accusing Israel of aggression. This aligns with the claim that Turkey's President urged action regarding Israel's intervention in Syria. However, the claim specifies March 2025, while the evidence mentions February 2025.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported. The evidence confirms the Turkish President's actions regarding Israel's intervention in Syria, but the timing is off by a month.

I need more information to verify the claim fully. Specifically, I need to confirm whether the Turkish President urged the U.S. in March 2025.

===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that the Turkish President did call for international intervention regarding Israel's actions in Syria, but this occurred in February 2025, not March 2025 as the claim states. Since the claim's timing is inaccurate, it is considered misleading.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image is associated with an article from Daraa24.org, which reports on the injury of two young men in Nahta, Daraa governorate, during a dispute. The image is not related to Israel bombing the surroundings of Southern Damascus or the destruction of army depots.

The claim is therefore false.

WEST BANK (Palestine Foundation Information Center) The Israeli occupation forces (IOF) kidnaped a number of Palestinian citizens during raids in the West Bank last night and on Tuesday morning, amid clashes in some areas.

According to local sources, the IOF stormed the southern area of al-Khalil City and kidnaped an ex-detainee from his home.

The IOF also kidnaped two other citizens from their homes in Dura town, southwest of al-Khalil.

In Bethlehem, the IOF kidnaped two young men after ransacking their homes in al-Khader town.

During their raid in al-Khader, the IOF threatened via megaphones to disrupt daily life in the town if local youths continued to throw stones at Jewish settlers.

In southern Bethlehem, Israeli forces gathered in the eastern area of Jurat ash-Sham’ah village before storming it and interrogating local residents during raids on homes.

Local sources in the village reported that Israeli soldiers inspected security cameras installed outside homes and stores.

In Ramallah, Israeli forces kidnaped a young man from his home in al-Am’ari refugee camp and stormed the towns of Silwad, Budrus and Kharbatha Bani Harith.

The IOF raided several homes during its raids in Ramallah and reportedly assaulted an ex-detainee called Bahaa Awad during a raid on his home in Budrus town. He suffered injuries and was rushed to a hospital.

In Jenin, the IOF kidnaped a young man following a violent raid on his home in al-Yamun town.

Israeli forces also stormed Bir Basha town in southern Jenin and kidnaped several local residents following raids on homes.

Local sources said that Israeli soldiers searched homes, interrogated residents and expelled farmers from their lands in the town.

The IOF also raided the house of ex-detainee Sultan Khallouf in Burqin town, west of Jenin, in an attempt to arrest him. His home had been stormed by Israeli forces several times recently for the same purpose.

In a separate incident, an Israeli soldier was injured last night when a Palestinian resistance fighter threw an explosive device at Israeli forces in the east of Nablus City, where a large number of extremist settlers were defiling Joseph’s Tomb.

Violent clashes also broke out between local youths and Israeli soldiers in the eastern area of Nablus and Qusra town during the presence of settlers in the area for rituals at the tomb. The IOF fired live ammunition during the events.

The IOF also prevented many local residents from reaching their homes in the eastern area of Nablus at the time.

Earlier, a large number of Israeli troops aboard military vehicles, including bulldozers, stormed the eastern area of Nablus City last night and spread through its streets in order to provide protection for buses and cars carrying dozens of settlers who came for rituals at Joseph’s Tomb.

According to local sources, the Israeli bulldozers blocked Amman street near Joseph’s Tomb with mounds of dirt and rocks, while snipers were deployed in buildings around the site before settlers flocked to the mausoleum.

Israeli soldiers reportedly assaulted young men after intercepting the car they were in in al-Quds street of Nablus City, while an IOF vehicle tried to run over a young man as he was trying to reach his home near Balata refugee camp, close to the city.

Palestinian paramedics provided one citizen with first aid and transferred him to the hospital after he suffered shrapnel wounds during the IOF raid in Nablus City.

Meanwhile, dozens of settlers gathered inside the mausoleum of Joseph’s Tomb, where they danced, sang, and screamed loudly and hysterically for long hours, causing a disturbance to the local residents living around it.

Israeli troops and settlers storm every week the eastern area of Nablus to perform rituals at the tomb, which they claim to be the resting-place of the biblical patriarch Joseph, while locals and Palestinian historians affirm that the grave belongs to a local medieval Muslim Sheikh called Yousef al-Duwaik.

خودروی نظامیان ارتش رژیم صهیونیستی شب گذشته در تله انفجاری مبارزان فلسطینی قرار گرفت و منهدم شد.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[العالم](http://fa.alalam.ir)
 - [فلسطین اشغالی](https://fa.alalam.ir/palestine)

به گزارش منابع فلسطینی، رزمندگان مقاومت با نظامیان غاصب صهیونیستی که به شهر طولکرم در کرانه باختری حمله کرده بودند، درگیر شدند و شماری از آنها را به هلاکت رساندند.

ارتش رژیم صهیونیستی نیز در واکنش به اقدام رزمندگان مقاومت و از روی عجز با بلدوزر به تخریب ساختار زیربنایی شهر طولکرم اقدام کرد. دستکم چهار شهروند فلسطینی از جمله یک زن در تیراندازی نظامیان رژیم صهیونیستی در این شهر زخمی شدند که حال یکی از آنها وخیم است.

پست برق اصلی اردوگاه طولکرم نیز از تجاوزگری ارتش رژیم صهیونیستی در امان نماند و نظامیان صهیونیست این پست را هدف قرار دادند که آتش سوزی و قطع برق تعدادی از محله ها در طولکرم را به دنبال داشت.

در جنایت دیگری نیز نظامیان ارتش رژیم صهیونیستی "مصعب مجاهد کامل المطری" جوان فلسطینی را در شهرک بیت عنان در شمال غرب قدس اشغالی به ضرب گلوله زخمی کردند که وی بر اثر شدت جراحت به شهادت رسید.

اعتداءات متصاعدة للمستوطنين.. اقتحامات واعتقالات واسعة للاحتلال في الضفة الغربية
================================================================================

!UpAKP <image:2024>

الإثنين 30 يونيو 2025 09:17 ص

**فلسطين المحتلة - شبكة قُدس:** شنت قوات الاحتلال الإسرائيلي، الليلة الماضية وفجر اليوم الاثنين، حملة اعتقالات واسعة طالت عددا من الفلسطينيين بينهم أسرى محررين، فيما واصل المستوطنون اعتداءاتهم على الفلسطينيين وممتلكاتهم ضمن وتيرة متصاعدة لهذه الاعتداءات في مختلف مناطق الضفة المحتلة.

ففي محافظة نابلس، اقتحمت قوات الاحتلال المدينة من حاجز بيت فوريك، كما داهمت مخيم بلاطة واعتقلت الأسير المحرر فهد صوالحي، الذي حررته المقاومة في صفقة التبادل الأخيرة.

 وخلال الاقتحام، اندلعت مواجهات عنيفة أُطلق خلالها النار على قوات الاحتلال، كما تم إلقاء عبوة محلية الصنع "كوع" باتجاه الآليات العسكرية. 

كذلك، اقتحمت قوات الاحتلال منزل الأسير المحرر رياض مرشود في ضاحية نابلس، وبلدة تل جنوب غرب المدينة.

وأغلق مستوطنون الطريق الرابط بين عقربا ومجدل بني فاضل جنوب نابلس، في إطار سياسة الاستفزاز والتضييق على الفلسطينيين.

وفي الخليل، اقتحمت قوات الاحتلال بلدة بيت أمر شمالًا، ومدينة يطا جنوبًا، في حين أقدم مستوطنون على اقتلاع نحو 150 شتلة زيتون في منطقة "اغزيوة" قرب قرية سوسيا في مسافر يطا، ضمن حملة تدمير ممنهجة تستهدف الأرض والبيئة الفلسطينية.

وأفادت مصادر محلية أن مستوطنين اقتعلوا نحو 150 شتلة زيتون في منطقة اغزيوة قرب قرية سوسيا بمسافر يطا.

وذكرت مصادر محلية أن الأرض تعود للفلسطيني محمد مخامرة، بالإضافة لتخريب جزء من السياج المحيط بها.

سبق ذلك، أن أصدر الاحتلال أوامر وضع يد على عدد من الطرق الحيوية والأراضي بهدف تمكين المستوطنات وعزل الأراضي بين المستوطنات والشوارع التي ينوي الاحتلال شقها أو الاستيلاء عليها وعزل الأراضي في مسافر يطا.

وشهدت مدينة طولكرم اقتحامين متزامنين، أحدهما في ضاحية اكتابا شمال المدينة، والآخر في بلدة عنبتا شرقًا، واقتحمت قوات الاحتلال أيضًا قرية مركة جنوب غرب جنين، وبلدة باقة الحطب شرق قلقيلية.

وفي مدينة رام الله، داهمت قوات الاحتلال حي الإرسال، ونفذت حملة تفتيش وتضييق على الأهالي.

واعتدى مستوطنون بالضرب على طاقم من المسعفين خلال قيامهم بنقل حالة مرضية بسيارة إسعاف قرب بلدة بيت لحم."

Content: "The lack of transparency has sparked growing resentment and anxiety among residents, particularly given the apparent impunity with which Israeli forces operate.

The July 13 incident follows an airborne operation on July 4, near the town of Yaafour, during which Israeli troops parachuted into Syrian territory—an unusual and provocative tactic that drew alarm even among pro-government circles in Daramsuq (Damascus).

While the Quneitra countryside remains under mounting pressure from Israeli military activity, neighboring Daraa Governorate has become the epicenter of civil unrest and grassroots resistance. <image:2050>\

****QUNEITRA / DARAMSUQ (Damascus) —**** The situation in southern Syria continues to deteriorate as Israeli forces launched yet another ground incursion early Sunday morning, this time targeting the towns of Suwaisa and Ain Zaywan in the southern Quneitra countryside. Over the past week, dozens of residents from the town of Tasil and surrounding areas have taken to the streets in anti-Daesh and anti-Israeli demonstrations, protesting what they describe as the return of former Islamic State operatives and the unchecked violations of Syrian sovereignty.

Protesters held banners reading “No to Terror, Yes to Justice” and “Syria is for Syrians, Not for Mercenaries or Occupiers.” Demonstrators voiced frustration over reports that former Islamic State (ISIS) terrorist fighters have reintegrated into local security forces with the tacit approval of Daramsuq (Damascus).

Eyewitnesses report that demonstrators in Tasil, Inkhil, and Jasim chanted against the resurgence of extremist actors in the region, as well as the lack of accountability for Israeli actions. “But the lack of transparency, the civilian casualties, and the increasing aggression suggest a deeper agenda tied to reshaping post-conflict Syria’s southern border reality.”

The call for independent investigations into both the military incursions and the security policies governing Daraa and Quneitra continues to grow, with activists urging the international community to monitor and intervene diplomatically.

As Israel’s operations in Syrian territory persist and civilian protests in Daraa expand, the Syrian government’s ability to guarantee basic security and sovereignty faces renewed scrutiny. The operation saw Israeli troops raid several homes and fire shots indiscriminately, further deepening local fears and aggravating instability, brfore withdrawing from the area.

According to Yasmin Abu Assaf, a local resident of Ain Zaywan, “a military unit entered the village before dawn, raiding three homes and conducting invasive searches.” The reasons behind the operation remain unclear. The Israeli unit later withdrew without making any arrests.

The situation escalated even further when another Israeli force advanced into the neighboring town of Suwaisa, where it opened heavy fire, causing panic among civilians. “The gunfire caused widespread fear, and many families ran for cover, not knowing what was happening.”

As of now, neither the Syrian government nor the United Nations peacekeeping forces stationed in the Golan region have issued statements on this latest incursion. The absence of any official explanation has only added to mounting speculation about Israeli intentions and the broader implications for the region’s fragile stability.

Israeli operations in Quneitra and surrounding areas have escalated in frequency, becoming almost daily events. In some cases, roadblocks were erected, and clashes briefly erupted between protesters and state-aligned militias attempting to disperse the crowds.

“The people of Daraa are caught between two fires—extremism on one side and foreign occupation on the other,” said a local community leader who asked to remain anonymous. “We want peace, but we also want our voices heard.”

The simultaneous pressure from Israeli incursions, radical insurgents, and state neglect highlights the complexity of the current security crisis in southern Syria."

Southern Syria has witnessed escalating tensions, with two Israeli patrols penetrating various areas of the Quneitra countryside, amid gunfire and widespread fires. Meanwhile, a mass demonstration erupted in the town of Tasil in the western Daraa countryside, rejecting the return of former ISIS mercenaries.

Local sources reported that an Israeli patrol entered the village of Ain Ziwan in the southern countryside this morning, followed by gunfire from the western Tal al-Ahmar area, for unknown reasons. They asserted that their presence poses a threat to its security, especially since some of them have joined the security forces of the Syrian transitional government.

Furthermore, the Syrian Observatory documented the deaths of 16 people in areas controlled by the Syrian transitional government over the past 24 hours, including victims of individual crimes, armed attacks, and landmine explosions, reflecting the continued fragility of the security situation in these areas.

The Israeli military has launched several new raids across the occupied West Bank, intensifying a monthlong operation that has killed hundreds of people and displaced thousands.

During the raids on Sunday and into Monday, [Israeli tanks](/news/2025/2/23/israel-expands-west-bank-offensive-says-troops-to-remain-for-next-year)

Reports that the army is planning to open up military corridors in the West Bank suggested an extended and expanded campaign.

The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) raised alarm at the deteriorating situation, saying winter weather was making it more difficult for displaced Palestinians to survive.

“Many people have fled their homes to take shelter, including in crowded mosques and schools. The operation began shortly after a Gaza ceasefire deal came into effect on January 19.

Monday’s raids hit areas across the territory as bulldozers and armoured vehicles continued to pound the northern West Bank areas of Jenin and Tulkarem, where large refugee camps are located.

Soldiers were reported to have stormed Jenin from the west, besieging the refugee camp and the areas adjacent to it.

They also imposed a curfew in the town of Qabatiya, to the south of Jenin, for a second straight day and stormed the nearby towns of al-Yamoun and Burqin.

The al-Quds Brigades, the armed wing of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, reported on Telegram that it was fighting with Israeli forces in Jenin.

“The Palestinians who have been forced from their homes in the occupied West Bank are going wherever they can – community centres, shelters, family and friends in nearby towns and villages, which are now also being under attack,” Al Jazeera’s Nour Odeh reported.

Fear of greater escalation
--------------------------

Hamas, the Palestinian Authority, neighbouring Jordan and the Arab League called on Monday for a halt to the intensifying attacks.

Brazil also urged a full suspension of Israeli military attacks and unimpeded international aid access to the occupied territory.

The deployment of Israeli tanks in the West Bank is an ominous sign, Odeh said.

Reporting from Amman, Jordan, because Al Jazeera is banned from Israel and the West Bank by the Israeli government and Palestinian Authority, Odeh noted that Israeli media have cited sources close to Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, outlining the army’s plans.

![Israel sends tanks into West Bank for first time in decades](/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025-02-23T181135Z_432697941_RC2F0DAUOJ9M_RTRMADP_3_ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-WEST-BANK-TANKS-1740382458.jpg?w=770&resize=770%2C513&quality=80)

Israel has been laying waste to Jenin for more than one month \[Raneen Sawafta/Reuters\]

“The Israeli media is quoting sources close to the prime minister saying that the army is intending to create large corridors in Tulkarem and Jenin – reminiscent of the so-called Netzarim Corridor in Gaza – in order to allow free movement for its forces and heavy equipment,” she said.

The Israeli-established and -occupied [Netzarim Corridor bisected Gaza](/news/2025/2/9/israeli-forces-withdraw-from-gazas-netzarim-corridor)
 and prevented displaced Palestinians from going back to their homes.

It is feared that a similar tactic in the West Bank would illustrate a plan to extend and expand the ongoing operation.

Hamas, which along with the Palestinian Authority condemned Israel for [assaults in the West Bank](/news/2025/2/19/israeli-armys-jenin-raid-enters-2nd-month-mass-displacement-in-west-bank)
, said Israel’s wish to stay there is “an illusion that will not come true”.

The Palestinian Authority called for urgent international intervention to “curb Israel’s unchecked aggression” and its effort to continue “genocide” against Palestinians.

More than 40,000 people have been displaced from Jenin and Tulkarem, including its Nur Shams refugee camp, by the ongoing Israeli operation.

Israeli Minister of Defence Israel Katz confirmed the number on Sunday, adding that the army intends to stay in the camps to prevent the return of residents.

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Monday raised alarm about the Israeli attacks on the West Bank while warning against a return to fighting in Gaza.

“I am gravely concerned by the rising violence in the occupied West Bank by Israeli settlers and other violations as well as calls for annexation,” he said.

Israeli settlers, who are often backed by armed soldiers, carry out daily attacks in the occupied territory.

Videos released by Palestinian outlets from overnight into Monday showed settlers scrawling a Star of David and Hebrew graffiti on a Palestinian property and lighting a fire during an attack on farmland east of Yatta in the Hebron governorate.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is partially supported by the evidence. The web search results confirm Israeli military activity in the Daraa governorate, including Tasil, in 2025. The Wikipedia article and the Syriacpress.com article mention Israeli incursions and demonstrations in Tasil. However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that the image depicts Israeli military forces entering Tasil on foot in February 2025. The image itself is present in the evidence, but its origin and context are not specified.

Therefore, while the claim's general context is supported, the specific details about the image and the exact date cannot be verified with the available information.

Another source, dated February 10, 2025, provides an Israel at War Situation Report, mentioning IDF operations in Gaza, a strike on a Hezbollah tunnel, and a counterterrorism operation in the West Bank.

## Elaboration
The claim is partially supported by the evidence. The web search results confirm Israeli military activity in the Daraa governorate, including Tasil, in 2025. The Wikipedia article and the Syriacpress.com article mention Israeli incursions and demonstrations in Tasil. However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that the image depicts Israeli military forces entering Tasil on foot in February 2025. The image itself is present in the evidence, but its origin and context are not specified.

Therefore, while the claim's general context is supported, the specific details about the image and the exact date cannot be verified with the available information.

The Hawar News Agency ([https://hawarnews.com/en/israeli-incursion-into-quneitra-and-demonstrations-in-daraa-against-return-of-isis-mercenaries](https://hawarnews.com/en/israeli-incursion-into-quneitra-and-demonstrations-in-daraa-against-return-of-isis-mercenaries)) reported on July 13, 2025, on Israeli patrols in Quneitra and a demonstration in Tasil, Daraa. <image:2050> <image:42> <image:42>


### Evidence from `web_search`
The provided web sources discuss the "2025 Israeli military operation in the West Bank" (<image:i>), also known as "Iron Wall," which began on January 21, 2025, involving the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and targeting Palestinian militants. Al Jazeera reported on February 24, 2025, about Israeli military raids in the occupied West Bank, including Jenin and Tulkarem, and the deployment of Israeli tanks. Another source, dated February 10, 2025, provides an Israel at War Situation Report, mentioning IDF operations in Gaza, a strike on a Hezbollah tunnel, and a counterterrorism operation in the West Bank.

## Elaboration
The claim is partially supported by the evidence. The web search results confirm Israeli military activity in the Daraa governorate, including Tasil, in 2025. The Wikipedia article and the Syriacpress.com article mention Israeli incursions and demonstrations in Tasil. However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that the image depicts Israeli military forces entering Tasil on foot in February 2025. The image itself is present in the evidence, but its origin and context are not specified.

Therefore, while the claim's general context is supported, the specific details about the image and the exact date cannot be verified with the available information.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image search provides an image of Israeli military forces, but it does not match the original image. The evidence confirms Israeli military presence in the Daraa governorate, including Tasil, in 2025. However, the evidence does not confirm that the original image depicts Israeli military forces entering Tasil on foot in February 2025.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified.

 [Benjamin Netanyahu](/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu "Benjamin Netanyahu")
 in the town of [Caesarea](/wiki/Caesarea_(modern_town) "Caesarea (modern town)")
, Israel. This targeting came in the context of ongoing escalation between [Israel](/wiki/Israel "Israel")
 and the [Axis of Resistance](/wiki/Axis_of_Resistance "Axis of Resistance")
, including [Hezbollah](/wiki/Hezbollah "Hezbollah")
, in light of the ongoing [Israeli–Lebanese conflict](/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Lebanese_conflict "Israeli–Lebanese conflict")

Attack
------

On October 19, 2024, Benjamin Netanyahu’s home in Caesarea was targeted by one of three drones, believed to have been launched from Lebanon. She reported that sirens had gone off around Caesarea only after the attack on Netanyahu's residence was confirmed.[\[2\]](#cite_note-:0-2)

Responses
---------

### Israel

Benjamin Netanyahu called the attack an attempted assassination against himself and his wife [Sara Netanyahu](/wiki/Sara_Netanyahu "Sara Netanyahu")
 conducted by Iranian proxies, stating that they had "made a bitter mistake".[\[2\]](#cite_note-:0-2)
 He further stated that the attack would not hinder or dissuade Israel from "the war of revival" against Israel's enemies and to ensure Israel's security for generations.[\[8\]](#cite_note-8)

[Israeli foreign minister](/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Israel) "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)")
 [Israel Katz](/wiki/Israel_Katz "Israel Katz")
 also stated that the attack was an assassination attempt against Netanyahu and his family conducted by Iranian proxies, and called the attack another exposure of "Iran’s true face and the evil axis it leads".[\[3\]](#cite_note-:1-3)

### Axis of Resistance

[Iran](/wiki/Iran "Iran")
 stated that Hezbollah was responsible for the reported attack, according to the state-run [Islamic Republic News Agency](/wiki/Islamic_Republic_News_Agency "Islamic Republic News Agency")
, which quoted Iran's mission to the UN stating, "The action in question has been carried out by Hezbollah in Lebanon."[\[9\]](#cite_note-9)

Hezbollah stated that it had conducted multiple rocket strikes across north and central Israel on the same day of the attack, although it did not explicitly state that it was responsible for the drone attack on Netanyahu's residence.[\[2\]](#cite_note-:0-2)
 Hezbollah later claimed responsibility for the attack on 22 October 2024.[\[10\]](#cite_note-10)

Al Jazeera reporter Nour Odeh called the attack a matter of concern for [Israeli security forces](/wiki/Israeli_security_forces "Israeli security forces")
, due to the fact that the drone successfully struck its intended target 70 kilometers (43 miles) away from the Lebanese border without triggering any sirens.[\[2\]](#cite_note-:0-2)

### International

[United States Secretary of Defense](/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Defense "United States Secretary of Defense")
 [Lloyd Austin](/wiki/Lloyd_Austin "Lloyd Austin")
, after receiving information regarding the attack from [Israel's Minister of Defense](/wiki/Ministry_of_Defense_(Israel) "Ministry of Defense (Israel)")
 [Yoav Gallant](/wiki/Yoav_Gallant "Yoav Gallant")
, was reported to have been "relieved" that Netanyahu survived, and began to review adjustments to United States operations in the Middle East, including the deployment of a [Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense](/wiki/Terminal_High_Altitude_Area_Defense "Terminal High Altitude Area Defense")
 system to bolster Israeli defense against the Axis of Resistance.[\[3\]](#cite_note-:1-3)

[British Prime Minister](/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom")
 [Sir Keir Starmer](/wiki/Keir_Starmer "Keir Starmer")
 held a call with Netanyahu following the attack, expressing alarm at the use of drones.[\[11\]](#cite_note-11)

Content: "The IDF said the drone was one of three launched from Lebanon, and that the other two were shot down.

And yet, despite this escalation against the elected premier, some political leaders, journalists, and social media influencers rendered it as a personal saga about the Netanyahus and their public image.

Using inflammatory, cynical, sometimes humorous posts, some reactions invoked perceptions of the couple as power-hungry greedy rulers, while others gave new life to the view that he was a mere victim of the legal system and political rivals that sought to bring him down.

### An assassination attempt on ‘me and my wife’

Netanyahu himself [described the attack](https://x.com/netanyahu/status/1847686585552134536)
 not as one targeting a head of government, but rather highlighted it as an assassination attempt on “me and my wife.”

He was quickly echoed by Shas party leader Aryeh Deri, a close Netanyahu ally whose electorate consists of hardcore Netanyahu supporters, who [tweeted](https://x.com/ariyederi/status/1847917421463519497)
 his support Sunday: “Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife, stay strong and courageous.”

The Likud party followed suit and weaponized the attack against Netanyahu’s political rivals, [accusing](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/yesh-atid-says-lapid-condemned-drone-attack-on-pms-residence-in-radio-interview-slams-likud-for-lying/)
 Opposition Leader Yair Lapid and National Unity chief Benny Gantz of failing to condemn it.

“At the moment of truth, they’ve failed to overcome petty politics and big egos,” said a statement issued Sunday by the Likud. <image:2105>](https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2024/10/1-21-e1729439173461.jpg)

A meme posted to Omer Ashkenazi’s Facebook page of Prime Minister Netanyahu and his family following the October 19, 2024, drone attack targeting his house in Israel, stating, ‘Bring Us Home Now.’ (used in accordance with Clause 27a of the Copyright Law)

### A property tax issue

Both Gantz and The Democrats party head Yair Golan chose to characterize the attack as yet another instance in which Netanyahu was simply looking out for his property, invoking his public image as greedy and self-serving.

“At a time when hundreds of rockets are being launched at the citizens of Israel … citizens are being murdered and soldiers are falling — the Prime Minister is busy with himself and the property tax,” the National Unity party stated Sunday.

This came after the Kan public broadcaster had reported that property tax officials and a gardener visited Netanyahu’s home following the attack.

Golan, whose Democrats party is a merger of Labor and Meretz, retorted during an interview Saturday on “Meet the Press,” “If renovating the house without it being hit by a drone wasn’t a problem, there wouldn’t be a problem afterward. <image:2106>](https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2024/10/2-18.jpg)

Fellow Haaretz journalist Uri Misgav, a long-time critic of Netanyahu who has extensively written about the prime minister’s alleged use of public funds to cover personal expenses, assailed the censor’s imposed restrictions in covering the story while similarly downplaying concerns of material damages as a result of the attack.

“I find it somewhat funny that since yesterday, the military censor has instructed not to report where exactly the drone struck in Caesarea, even though property tax officials have already arrived at the scene,” he [posted to Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/nhavip123/posts/10234099090079390)
.

### Taking a swipe at Netanyahu’s legal and political adversaries

Moti Kastel, a journalist for Channel 14 considered by many to be a Netanyahu mouthpiece, chose to blame the premier’s perceived nemeses for the supposed tragedy averted at the last minute.

He [tweeted](https://x.com/KastelMoti/status/1847704742249541815)
: “This would be a good time to mention that Attorneys General Gali Baharav-Miara and Shlomit Barnea Farago — who are systematically obstructing and delaying vital requests for reinforcement at the prime minister’s residences – are risking his and his wife’s lives while leaking it to the media as ‘protecting and safeguarding’ public funds.”

Attorney-General Baharav-Miara oversees the prosecution of Netanyahu’s corruption charges; Barnea Farago is the legal adviser at the Prime Minister’s office.

Journalist and social media influencer Yotam Zimri took a swipe at Lapid for initially not condemning the failed attempt to target Netanyahu, [saying](https://x.com/YotYotam/status/1847883065705541946)
 that Lapid, “Doesn’t comment on failures.”

### Humorous fusion

And then there are the regular Israelis, who are coping with the news through cynical, sometimes dark, humor, fusing together unrelated stories.

One Facebook user [posted a meme](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=3912514032404399&set=p.3912514032404399)
 invoking [Netanyahu’s attempt to rename the war as The War of Revival](https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-suggests-changing-name-of-gaza-war-to-war-of-revival/)
.

It depicts the Netanyahus standing in their swimming pool, saying: “If you have a problem renovating our pool during the war, we’ll call it the Revival Pool.”

Another user propagated a cynical conspiracy theory suggesting Netanyahu had hoped for his home to be destroyed, presumably for reasons relating to property tax.

A meme [posted](https://www.facebook.com/Gil.Nathan15/posts/122143061114318176)

 on Saturday.

The prime minister and his wife were not present at the house and no injuries were reported. And the state will pay, don’t worry.”

Several left-leaning journalists similarly chose to narrow the story down to the material damage the attack might have caused to Netanyahu’s house.

Haaretz journalist Chaim Levinson [commented](https://x.com/chaimlevinson/status/1847939700037697686)
 on a report whereby Director General of the Prime Minister’s Office Yossi Shelley, who also heads the Tekuma administration responsible for rebuilding the Gaza enclave, had already met with tax officials, cynically juxtaposing it with the slower treatment ordinary residents receive.

“Kudos to Yossi Shelley for quickly addressing every single house destroyed or damaged throughout the north."

Two more drones that crossed into Israeli territory were intercepted, the military said.

There were no casualties reported, according to the Israeli ambulance service and police said explosions had been heard in Caesarea, coastal town where Netanyahu has a holiday home.

The drone attack was not immediately claimed by the Lebanese Iran-backed group Hezbollah, which has been trading fire with Israel since last October, or any other militant group.

A drone from Lebanon struck a building near the private residence of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel on Saturday, his office said, highlighting the [continuing challenge](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/14/world/middleeast/hezbollah-drone-attack-israel.html)
 posed to Israel’s air defense by unmanned vehicles.

Mr. [Experts say](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/14/world/middleeast/hezbollah-drone-attack-israel.html)
 they pose a particular challenge for Israel because they emit less heat, often contain less metal and fly at lower altitudes and slower speeds than the rockets and missiles its air defenses are primarily designed to thwart.

On Saturday, as the Israeli military tried to determine how one drone had evaded the system in Caesarea, it said that dozens of other “projectiles” had entered Israel from Lebanon.

Most of them were either intercepted or allowed to fall into unpopulated areas, but one man was killed and another injured during a rocket barrage fired toward the city of Acre, [according to Magen David Adom](https://x.com/Mdais/status/1847581569239630095?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet)
, Israel’s emergency service.

Israel’s vulnerability to drones was also illustrated in June, when Hezbollah broadcast footage of sensitive installations in Haifa, Israel’s third-largest city, that it captured from a drone that hovered over the northern city seemingly without being detected.

The Hezbollah drone episode that [killed four soldiers](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/13/world/middleeast/lebanon-israel-hezbollah.html)
 nearly a week ago occurred at a military training base near Binyamina, just outside Caesarea.

And in July, Israel was stunned when a drone launched by the Houthi militia in Yemen, another Iranian proxy, slammed into an apartment building near a United States Embassy branch office in a popular beachfront neighborhood of Tel Aviv, [killing one person and injuring eight others](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/world/middleeast/houthis-drone-strike-tel-aviv.html)

[SKIP ADVERTISEMENT](#after-bottom) Netanyahu and his wife were not home at the time of the strike, according to the prime minister’s office, which said that there had been no injuries.

The episode came nearly a week after [a Hezbollah drone attack](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/13/world/middleeast/lebanon-israel-hezbollah.html)
 killed four people and wounded dozens of others at a military base in northern Israel.

The military said it had intercepted two additional drones launched on Saturday, which set off air-raid sirens at a military base in Glilot, just north of Tel Aviv. Netanyahu described the drone strike as an attempt to assassinate him, calling it “a grave mistake.” He added, “This will not deter me or the state of Israel from continuing our just war against our enemies.”

Israel possesses some of the most advanced and effective air defense technology in the world, a multilayered system that has intercepted nearly all of the thousands of drones, missiles and rockets fired at it over the past year by Iran and its regional proxy forces, including Hezbollah in Lebanon.

But drones — which are cheaper for its adversaries to acquire and operate — have occasionally evaded Israel’s air defenses. But that did not trigger sirens in Caesarea, the coastal location of Mr."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that a drone attack occurred on October 19, 2024, targeting Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in Caesarea, Israel ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_drone_attack_on_Benjamin_Netanyahu%27s_residence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_drone_attack_on_Benjamin_Netanyahu%27s_residence), [https://www.timesofisrael.com/drones-moans-and-groans-hezbollah-attacks-pms-home-petty-politics-continue-unintercepted/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/drones-moans-and-groans-hezbollah-attacks-pms-home-petty-politics-continue-unintercepted/), [https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/drone-launched-netanyahu-home-northern-israel-spokesman-says-2024-10-19/](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/drone-launched-netanyahu-home-northern-israel-spokesman-says-2024-10-19/)). However, the provided sources explicitly state that Netanyahu and his wife were not present during the attack and that there were no injuries.

The evidence does not mention Yair Netanyahu being killed in the attack. Therefore, the claim that Yair Netanyahu was killed in the drone attack is not supported by the provided evidence.

Content: The New York Times reports that on October 19, 2024, a drone struck a building near Benjamin Netanyahu's private residence in Caesarea, Israel. <image:i> The article mentions that Netanyahu and his wife were not home at the time and there were no injuries. The article also mentions a Hezbollah drone attack nearly a week prior that killed four people. The author is Liam Stack.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that a drone attack occurred on October 19, 2024, targeting Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in Caesarea, Israel ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_drone_attack_on_Benjamin_Netanyahu%27s_residence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_drone_attack_on_Benjamin_Netanyahu%27s_residence), [https://www.timesofisrael.com/drones-moans-and-groans-hezbollah-attacks-pms-home-petty-politics-continue-unintercepted/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/drones-moans-and-groans-hezbollah-attacks-pms-home-petty-politics-continue-unintercepted/), [https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/drone-launched-netanyahu-home-northern-israel-spokesman-says-2024-10-19/](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/drone-launched-netanyahu-home-northern-israel-spokesman-says-2024-10-19/)). However, the provided sources explicitly state that Netanyahu and his wife were not present during the attack and that there were no injuries.

The evidence does not mention Yair Netanyahu being killed in the attack. Therefore, the claim that Yair Netanyahu was killed in the drone attack is not supported by the provided evidence.

On October 19, 2024, a drone attack targeted Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in Caesarea, Israel, as reported by Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_drone_attack_on_Benjamin_Netanyahu%27s_residence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_drone_attack_on_Benjamin_Netanyahu%27s_residence)), The Times of Israel ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/drones-moans-and-groans-hezbollah-attacks-pms-home-petty-politics-continue-unintercepted/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/drones-moans-and-groans-hezbollah-attacks-pms-home-petty-politics-continue-unintercepted/)), and Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/drone-launched-netanyahu-home-northern-israel-spokesman-says-2024-10-19/](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/drone-launched-netanyahu-home-northern-israel-spokesman-says-2024-10-19/)). The attack was part of the Israeli–Lebanese conflict and was claimed by Hezbollah.

The Times of Israel reported that Netanyahu and his wife were not present and there were no injuries. The Reuters article also stated that Netanyahu was not present and there were no casualties. The Times of Israel included a tweet from Benjamin Netanyahu describing the attack as an assassination attempt. The Wikipedia article mentions that Yair Netanyahu is the son of Benjamin Netanyahu. <image:k>, <image:2105>, <image:2106>

[AP Fact Check](https://apnews.com/ap-fact-check)

Mel Gibson did not post on social media about ‘the end’ of Israel
=================================================================

             ![FILE - Mel Gibson arrives at the 89th Academy Awards Nominees Luncheon in Beverly Hills, Calif. The post was not made by Gibson, who does not have any public social media accounts, the actor’s publicist told The Associated Press.

THE FACTS: As [fighting continues](https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-live-updates-11-10-2023-23bdb85ebccb68374464fd816aacd7a1)
 in the latest Israel-Hamas war, some online are sharing the image to falsely suggest that the “Braveheart” star has weighed in.

The image is made to look like a social media post, with a profile photo of Gibson alongside his name and a time stamp, although it isn’t quite the same layout as a post on major platforms such as Facebook, Instagram or X, formerly known as Twitter.

The “post” features a picture of the Israeli flag with an hourglass in the center instead of the Star of David, and is captioned: “Soon the end and they know it, that’s why they want to destroy everything in the way.”

But Alan Nierob, Gibson’s publicist, told the AP in an email that the actor “did not make the post.” Moreover, he confirmed that Gibson “doesn’t have any public social media accounts.”

Content: "Mel Gibson Addresses Accusations of Anti-Semitism
=================================================

ByABC News [![via GMA logo](https://s.abcnews.com/assets/dtci/random/svg/gma_logo.svg)](https://www.goodmorningamerica.com)

October 12, 2006, 7:29 AM

Oct. 13, 2006 &#151; -- Actor-director Mel Gibson told Diane Sawyer today that he was "ashamed" by the remarks about Jews he made during his July arrest for driving while intoxicated.

As most people have heard, Gibson is devoutly religious, which is what inspired him to make "The Passion of the Christ."

His church is a Catholic splinter group called traditionalist Catholics. So, you know, you have your own fears about these things," he said on "Good Morning America."

"Now, maybe it was just that very day that Lebanon and Israel were at it, you know," Gibson said of that night.

It was the 17th day of the raging war in Lebanon. The group feels the modern Catholic Church has abandoned the real faith.

His father, 88-year-old Hutton Gibson, is well known for his writings that attack the Vatican.

Gibson's church believes in the Latin Mass and literal reading of the Bible. Gibson has talked about a war of biblical proportions, though no one can say when it will happen or where.

On the night of July 28, Gibson said he knew what might have been in his mind as he drunkenly said, "Jews are responsible for all the wars in the world."

"That's fear related, OK? I think that they're not blameless in the conflict. So, they're not blameless."

A new study debunks claims that a magnitude 4.5 earthquake in Iran was a covert nuclear weapons test, as widely alleged on social media and some mainstream news outlets in October 2024, a period of heightened geopolitical tensions in the Middle East.

Led by Johns Hopkins University scientists, the study warns about the potential consequences of mishandling and misinterpreting scientific information, particularly during periods of international conflict. The findings appear in the journal _[Seismica](https://seismica.library.mcgill.ca/article/view/1512)
_.

###### Key Takeaways

*   Seismic data shows a natural fault-driven event, not a covert nuclear test, caused an October 2024 earthquake in Iran.
*   False nuclear test claims hit social media just minutes after the earthquake, escalating with misused data and links to unrelated events.
*   English-language media outlets, especially in India, fueled the misinformation, while Persian-language media largely got the science right.

"There was a concerted misinformation and disinformation campaign around this event that promoted the idea this was a nuclear test, which is not something you often see happen with an earthquake," said [Benjamin Fernando](https://eps.jhu.edu/directory/benjamin/)
, a Johns Hopkins seismologist who led the study. The 2015 event shares a nearly identical seismic pattern with the 2024 earthquake. 5 earthquake, along with two similar events identified by the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization. The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO), which monitors nuclear tests worldwide, reported that earthquakes with similar characteristics and magnitudes occurred in the same region in 2015 and 2018—both unrelated to nuclear activity.

Despite the clear scientific evidence of natural seismic activity, claims that the earthquake was a nuclear test began spreading rapidly on social media just 17 minutes after the event. Over the following hours, misinformation escalated, with some posts citing seismic data from an entirely different earthquake in Armenia earlier that day to substantiate the nuclear test narrative.

The misinformation gained traction as conspiracy theories linked the Iranian earthquake to a supposed seismic event in Israel the same evening. The researchers also identified media reports from the United States, Israel, Pakistan, Zimbabwe, France, and the United Kingdom.

In contrast, Persian-language media generally described the event accurately as a natural earthquake. Geological Survey."

==================================================================================================================

[Ryan Whalen](https://thedebrief.org/author/ryanwhalen/)
·February 4, 2025

In October 2024, claims began to circulate that a magnitude 4.5 [earthquake](https://thedebrief.org/predicting-earthquakes-hours-ahead-of-time-may-finally-be-possible/)
 in Iran was something far more sinister: the actual source of the quake, according to claims that gained traction on social media and even several mainstream media outlets, was linked to a secret [atomic weapons](https://thedebrief.org/six-times-the-u-s-military-completely-lost-nuclear-weapons/)
 test.

Now, scientists at Johns Hopkins University say the claims were untrue, according to a new study debunking them as [misinformation](https://thedebrief.org/?s=misinformation#:~:text=STUDY%20REVEALS%20ONLINE%20CONTENT%20MODERATORS%20CAN%20EASILY%20BECOME%20VICTIMS%20OF%20MISINFORMATION)
 propelled during a period of rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East.

The researchers say the case offers a cautionary tale in an era of declining media trust, the [proliferation of false information](https://thedebrief.org/disinformation-covert-influence-and-cyber-espionage-still-a-major-problem-on-social-media-latest-meta-report-reveals/)
, and high penetration of viral content. 

An October Misinformation Surprise
----------------------------------

On October 5, 2024, a 4.5 magnitude Earthquake struck 31 miles outside the northern Iranian city of Semnan, placing it within only 134 miles of the capital city, Tehran. Geological Survey.”

The paper “[The Propagation of Seismic Waves, Misinformation, and Disinformation from the 2024-10-05 M 4.5 Iran Earthquake](https://dx.doi.org/10.26443/seismica.v4i1.1512)
” appeared on February 4, 2025 in _Seismica._

(Pixabay)

Online Conspiracies Linked an Iranian Earthquake to a Secret Atomic Bomb Test. Within 17 minutes, the first social media claims linking the earthquake to a covert nuclear test appeared before jumping to Twitter/X ten minutes after that.

“There was a concerted misinformation and disinformation campaign around this event that promoted the idea this was a nuclear test, which is not something you often see happen with an earthquake,” [said lead author Benjamin Fernando](https://hub.jhu.edu/2025/02/04/earthquake-nuclear-test-misinformation/)
 of Johns Hopkins.

Confusing Misinformation Spreads
--------------------------------

The claims rapidly spreading across social media devolved into a quagmire of conflated data, primarily driven by poor analysis. Within hours, posts presented data from an unrelated earthquake in Armenia that day as proof of the nuclear scenario.

Additionally, claimants attempted to connect the Iranian incident with an earthquake in Israel on the same night. While Iran is naturally earthquake-prone because it straddles the Arabian and Eurasian tectonic plates, it didn’t take long for more exotic explanations to arise. While Indian sources comprised the bulk of the coverage, the stories spread to news media in the United States, Israel, Pakistan, Zimbabwe, France, and the United Kingdom.

Further muddying the waters were social media accounts seizing upon mistaken misinformation to intentionally generate and spread active [disinformation](https://thedebrief.org/misinformation-and-disinformation-the-biggest-short-term-threat-to-global-stability-warns-latest-davos-report/)
. That reporting focused on explaining the natural earthquake, ignoring more fantastical interpretations. Local media’s precision reporting is derived from consulting subject matter experts and looking at official data, leading to a more accurate portrayal of what occurred.

Confronting the Seismic Data
----------------------------

The Johns Hopkins team employed publicly available data from seismic monitoring stations to conduct an intensive analysis of the Iranian earthquake. Everything the team found in their analysis aligns with the standard behavior expected of the region’s typical tectonic behavior, eliminating peculiar causation like a nuclear explosion.

“Seismic waves carry information about the earthquake that produced them as they propagate around the planet."

While underground nuclear tests can produce seismic activity, the specifics of this event raise questions. At around 10:45 PM local time, the tremors were felt as far away as Tehran, approximately 110 km from the epicentre, according to the US Geological Survey.

Just minutes after the initial quake, a second, weaker tremor was reported in Israel around midnight, further fuelling concerns and theories about the nature of these seismic events. No country will mess with a nuclear power.”

Since Hamas attacked southern Israel on October 7, 2023, the Jewish state's airstrikes have killed over 42,000 Palestinians and internally displaced nearly the entire population of Gaza. Despite the growing humanitarian crisis, the government led by Benjamin Netanyahu, with support from the United States, shows no signs of reducing its military actions.

Protesters demanding a deal freeing hostages in Gaza gather around 27 mock coffins at Tel Aviv's Habima Square on September 5, 2024. (Noam Lehmann/Times of Israel)

About 300 people are marching from Tel Aviv’s Habima Square to the IDF headquarters on Begin Street to demand a ceasefire deal in Gaza to free hostages, kicking off a fifth straight night of protests after the IDF said Sunday it had recovered the bodies of six Israelis in Hamas hands slain days earlier.

The group carries 27 mock coffins, representing 27 hostages killed in captivity in Gaza.

Speaking ahead of the march, Gil Dickmann, whose cousin Carmel Gat was one of the six slain hostages whose remains were recovered over the weekend, accuses Netanyahu of “sentencing my cousin to death.”

Some members of the crowd shout: “Murderer!”

“She was abandoned to her death by a government that could have saved her,” Dickmann says, noting the number of days she was held captive. [Skip to main content](#main-content)

Israelis gathered at Hostages Square in Tel Aviv mourned the return of the bodies

On a bleak late winter's day, under leaden skies and occasional driving rain, this was the moment all Israelis had been dreading.

The return of the dead.

It began, as all the handovers so far have begun, with a politically charged display by Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups involved in holding Israeli hostages for over 500 days.

Once again, there was a stage, flanked by huge posters highlighting the catastrophic consequences of Israel's military campaign in Gaza and the Palestinian determination to stay put.

But instead of haunted, sometimes emaciated, survivors, there were four black coffins, each bearing a photograph and a name – Oded Lifschitz, Shiri Bibas and her two young sons, Ariel and Kfir - accompanied by the image of Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.

Missile casings bore the slogan: "They were killed by US bombs". In a rare public statement on the matter, they had urged Hamas to conduct the handover in a private, dignified fashion.

Their efforts had clearly been in vain, but they attempted to screen the coffins from public scrutiny, draping each one in a white sheet before driving them away.

The watching crowd was smaller than usual, perhaps because of the heavy rain.

After Thursday morning's handover, at a military ceremony on the edge of the Gaza Strip, the coffins carrying the hostages were draped with Israeli flags and prayers offered by the army's chief rabbi.

A convoy of vehicles then made its way north towards the Abu Kabir forensic institute, in Jaffa, where formal identification of the bodies is taking place.

Along the route, small groups of Israelis stood silently in the rain, carrying Israeli flags and yellow banners - the colour associated with the hostages and their supporters.

In Karmei Gat, where displaced members of kibbutz Nir Oz are living, waiting to go home, the vigil was particularly sombre.

All four of Thursday's released hostages were seized from Nir Oz on 7 October 2023.

Tel Aviv's Hostages Square was a study in grief, with people crying or sitting on the ground, heads in hands.

The faces of the red-headed Bibas boys - Ariel and Kfir - are plastered on walls, road signs and in windows up and down the country. <image:2227>!EPA Red Cross vehicle drives through lines of Palestinians in Khan Younis, Gaza (20/02/25) <image:2230>EPA

Some Gaza expressed bitterness that bodies of Israelis had been released

Meanwhile, back in Gaza, some Palestinians expressed their anger that Israeli bodies had been handed over, while an unknown number of Palestinians killed in Israel's military campaign remain buried in the apocalyptic wreckage of the Gaza Strip.

In addition, as many as 665 bodies are being held by Israel in numbered cemeteries, according to a Palestinian protest group, The National Campaign to Recover the Bodies of the Martyrs.

Return of bodies marks day of anguish for Israel

! Hamas has long argued that all four were killed by Israeli air raids on Gaza, something which has not been verified.

As previously, Red Cross officials were on hand to oversee the process. Fearing the worst, Israelis have nevertheless clung to the hope that the brothers might have survived, along with their mother, Shiri.

"We were devastated by the news," Orly Marron said, outside Abu Kabir.

"I have red-headed grandchildren and seeing the photographs is really very heartbreaking."

Oded Lifschitz's son, Yizhar, meanwhile told Israel Radio that he had always feared for his father's health, since his violent abduction in October 2023.

Oded was 84 years old at the time. Israel allowed the equipment to enter, in exchange for Thursday's handover and the release of six more living hostages this coming Saturday.

Protesters say the Israeli government hasn't done enough to secure the release of their loved ones and accuse Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of potentially derailing talks with new demands.

Protesters have staged a sombre march through Tel Aviv carrying makeshift coffins draped with Israeli flags to symbolise the hostages still being held captive by Hamas in Gaza. 

They're angry with the Israeli government who they say hasn't done enough to strike a ceasefire and secure the release of their loved ones.

"Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, sentenced Carmel, my cousin, to death," said Gil Dickmann, the cousin of Carmel Gat whose body was recovered by the Israeli military from Gaza on Saturday.

"327 days she was there in Gaza, in captivity. More than 100 were released during a temporary pause in fighting in November and Israeli authorities believe around 70 are still alive in Gaza.

Ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas have limped along for weeks with both sides accusing the other for the lack of progress.

The United States says it is developing a new proposal for a ceasefire and hostage release deal in hopes of ending the nearly 11-month-old war.

A further complication to the already fragile negotiations is Netanyahu's comments on Wednesday.

He demanded that Israel keep open-ended control of Gaza’s border with Egypt, known as the Philadelphi Corridor.

"Gaza must be demilitarized and this can only happen if the Philadelphi Corridor remains under firm control,” Netanyahu said on Wednesday, claiming Israeli troops had discovered dozens of tunnels under the border.

The question of Israeli control of the narrow strip of land which it seized in May, has become a central obstacle in the talks.

Hamas has demanded an eventual full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza in the multi-phase truce deal.

Egypt, a mediator in the talks along with the US and Qatar, has also demanded a concrete timeline for Israeli troops to leave the Philadelphi Corridor.

And in angry public statements on Thursday, the families of hostages accused Netanyahu of derailing ceasefire talks and potentially sacrificing their relatives.

The Hamas-run health ministry says more than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since fighting started on October 7 but it doesn’t distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count.

Over the border, the death toll in Israel stands at more than 1,100. Around 250 were abducted by Hamas in their incursion into Israel."

The Times of Israel ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/carrying-fake-coffins-protesters-march-in-tel-aviv-to-demand-hostage-deal/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/carrying-fake-coffins-protesters-march-in-tel-aviv-to-demand-hostage-deal/)) and Euronews ([https://www.euronews.com/2024/09/05/protesters-march-in-tel-aviv-with-makeshift-coffins-to-demand-release-of-gaza-hostages](https://www.euronews.com/2024/09/05/protesters-march-in-tel-aviv-with-makeshift-coffins-to-demand-release-of-gaza-hostages)) reported on a protest in Tel Aviv on September 5, 2024, where demonstrators used mock coffins draped with Israeli flags to symbolize hostages held in Gaza. The Times of Israel mentions 27 mock coffins representing 27 hostages killed in captivity. <image:49>

A BBC News article ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93npgqlzvpo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93npgqlzvpo)) from February 20, 2025, discusses the return of the bodies of Israeli hostages. <image:2228> <image:2227>


## Elaboration
The image depicts a protest in Tel Aviv on September 5, 2024, where demonstrators used mock coffins draped with Israeli flags to symbolize hostages held in Gaza. The Times of Israel reported that the coffins represented hostages killed in captivity. Therefore, the claim that the image shows coffins of dead Israeli soldiers is inaccurate.


## Final Judgement
The image shows mock coffins used in a protest in Tel Aviv on September 5, 2024, to symbolize hostages held in Gaza, not dead Israeli soldiers. The claim misrepresents the context and purpose of the coffins.

`misleading`

A photo of ministers in the Israeli occupation government, including Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, inside a shelter, was recently shared on [“X”](https://x.com/Afcq1954/status/1827556012284404182)
 . The photo was accompanied by the following text: “The extremist Israeli Finance Minister Smotrich was the first to flee to shelters,” indicating that the photo was taken at the same time as Hezbollah’s recent bombing of sites in Israel. 

! While Hezbollah announced today that it launched a large-scale attack targeting military sites in the occupying state with a large number of missiles and drones.

Content: "Mourners shouted at government officials at the funerals, the Times of Israel reported, with one man yelling "get him out of here" to far-right finance minister Bezalel Smotrich.

"There is no doubt that Hezbollah has crossed all the red lines here, and the response will reflect that," Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz told Israeli Channel 12. official told CBS News that Saturday had been a busy day of "almost all-out war" between Israel and Hezbollah. 

Last week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met [separately with President Biden](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-netanyahu-speech-meeting-israel-hamas-war/)
 and Vice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic nominee, and also [visited the Republican nominee](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-meets-benjamin-netanyahu-mar-a-lago-florida/)
, former President Donald Trump, at Mar-a-Lago.Harris' national security adviser, Phil Gordon, said on social media Sunday that the vice president had been briefed and is closely monitoring the situation.

"She condemns this horrific attack and mourns for all those killed and wounded," he added.

White House officials have feared a "nightmare scenario" of an errant rocket or missile causing unintended consequences such as mass casualties and forcing a heavier Israeli response.

Biden White House officials have been working the phones trying to de-escalate and contain the response.  But U.S. Israel's military said its air force targeted a Hezbollah arms depot in the border village of Kfar Kila, adding that militants were inside at the time.

Hezbollah said its fighters carried out 10 different attacks using rockets and explosive drones against Israeli military posts, the last of which targeted the army command of the Haramoun Brigade in Maaleh Golani with Katyusha rockets. In recent weeks, the exchange of fire along the Lebanon-Israel border has intensified, with Israeli airstrikes and rocket and drone attacks by Hezbollah striking deeper and farther away from the border.

Not Now Turn On urges restraint after Hezbollah attack

! calls for restraint after deadly Hezbollah rocket attack in Golan Heights 02:07](https://www.cbsnews.com/video/u-s-calls-for-restraint-after-deadly-hezbollah-rocket-attack-in-golan-heights/)

The U.S. blamed Hezbollah for a rocket attack a day earlier on a Golan Heights soccer field that [killed at least 12 children and teens](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/golan-heights-rocket-attack-israel-hezbollah/)
, sparking fears of a broader conflict in the region. 

U.S. National Security Council spokeswoman Adrienne Watson said in a statement Sunday that the rocket was a Hezbollah rocket and "launched from an area they control." Hezbollah has denied responsibility. 

Israel's military confirmed it had launched airstrikes against Hezbollah targets "deep inside Lebanese territory." 

The airstrikes were apparent retaliation for Saturday's rocket strike, which Israeli military's chief spokesman, Rear Adm. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, traveling in Japan, told reporters on Sunday that "every indication is that indeed the rockets were from or the rocket was from Hezbollah."

Content: "condemns attack, says support for Israel is 'iron-clad'

JERUSALEM/BEIRUT, July 27 (Reuters) - A rocket attack on a football ground in the Israeli-occupied [Golan Heights](/article/world/what-is-the-significance-of-the-golan-heights-idUSKCN1R22IR/)
 killed 12 people including children on Saturday, Israeli authorities said, blaming [Hezbollah](/world/middle-east/what-is-hezbollah-group-backing-hamas-against-israel-2024-02-15/)
 and vowing to inflict a heavy price on the Iran-backed Lebanese group.

Hezbollah denied any responsibility for the strike, the deadliest in Israel or Israeli-annexed territory since the start of [the conflict in Gaza](/world/middle-east/is-hezbollah-israel-conflict-about-spiral-2024-06-05/)

The attack sharply escalated tensions in the hostilities which have been fought in parallel to the Gaza war and has [raised fears](/world/middle-east/lebanon-border-israel-hezbollahs-deadly-game-patience-2024-07-24/)
 of a full-blown conflict between the heavily armed adversaries.

The rocket struck a football pitch in the Druze village of Majdal Shams in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, territory captured from Syria by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed in a move not recognised by most countries.

"Hezbollah will pay a heavy price, the kind it has thus far not paid," Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a phone call with the leader of the Druze community in Israel, according to a statement from his office.

In a written statement, Hezbollah said: "The Islamic Resistance has absolutely nothing to do with the incident, and categorically denies all false allegations in this regard".

Hezbollah had earlier announced several rocket attacks targeting Israeli military positions.

The Israeli ambulance service said 13 more people were wounded by the rocket that hit the soccer pitch which was filled at the time with children and teenagers.

The Israeli military said the rocket launch was carried out from an area located north of the village of Chebaa in southern Lebanon.

Speaking with reporters at Majdal Shams, Israeli military spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said that forensics showed the rocket was an Iranian-made Falaq-1.

Hezbollah had earlier announced firing a Falaq-1 missile on Saturday, saying it had targeted an Israeli military headquarters.

In a televised statement, Hagari also said that for now there was no change in Home Front Command instructions, indicating the army was not expecting imminent escalation across Israel.

Netanyahu's far-right coalition ally, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, called for tough retaliation, including against Hezbollah's leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah.

*   Summary

*   Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah denies any role
*   Israeli PM Netanyahu vows Hezbollah will pay price for attack
*   U.S. The Blue Line refers to the frontier between Lebanon and Israel.

Moscow, which has ties with most of the key players in the Middle East, including Israel, Iran, the Palestinian Authority and Hamas, condemned the attacks in the Golan Heights.

"We condemn all terrorist actions undertaken by any entity," Russian TASS state news agency cited Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov as saying on Sunday.

Item 1 of 6 Soccer pitch in Majdal Shams, a Druze village in Golan Heights, July 27, 2024. Israeli strikes have killed some 350 Hezbollah fighters in Lebanon and more than 100 civilians, including medics, children and journalists.

The Israeli military said after Saturday's attack the death toll among civilians killed in Hezbollah attacks had risen to 23 since October, along with at least 17 soldiers.

Andrea Tenenti, spokesperson for the UNIFIL peacekeeping force which operates in southern Lebanon, told Reuters its force commander was in contact with authorities in both Lebanon and Israel "to understand the details of the Majdal Shams incident and to maintain calm".

A senior diplomat focused on Lebanon said all efforts were now needed to avoid an all-out war.

ATTACKS FROM LEBANON
--------------------

Hezbollah is the most powerful of a network of Iran-backed groups across the Middle East that have entered the fray in support of their Palestinian ally Hamas since October.

Iraqi groups and the Houthis of Yemen have both fired at Israel. Two security sources in Lebanon said the four fighters killed in the Israeli strike on Kfarkila in southern Lebanon were members of different armed groups, with at least one of them belonging to Hezbollah.

The Israeli military said its aircraft had targeted a military structure belonging to Hezbollah, after identifying a militant cell entering the building.

At least 30 rockets were then fired from Lebanon across the border, the military said.

Hezbollah claimed at least four attacks, including with Katyusha rockets, in retaliation for the Kfarkila attacks.

Netanyahu, already due to head back from the United States to Israel overnight on Saturday, said he would bring his flight forward and convene his security cabinet upon arrival.

, which has been leading diplomatic efforts aimed at de-escalating the conflict across the Lebanese-Israeli border, condemned it as a horrific attack and said U.S. support for Israel's security was "iron-clad and unwavering against all Iranian backed terrorist groups, including Lebanese Hezbollah".

The United States "will continue to support efforts to end these terrible attacks along the Blue Line, which must be a top priority," the spokesperson for the White House National Security Council said in a statement. Hamas has also carried out rocket attacks on Israel from Lebanon, as has the Lebanese Sunni group, the Jama'a Islamiya.

More than 40,000 people live on the Israeli-occupied Golan, more than half of them Druze residents. The Druze are an Arab minority who practice an offshoot of Islam.

The attack on the soccer pitch followed an Israeli strike in Lebanon that killed four militants on Saturday."

On 25 August 2024, Israel and Hezbollah engaged in one of the most intense exchanges of fire since October 2023. The Israeli military said it had targeted hundreds of rocket launchers to thwart what it described as an imminent large-scale attack by Hezbollah,[1](javascript:void(0))

 which has been anticipated since 30 July after Israel claimed responsibility for [the assassination of senior Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr](https://acleddata.com/2024/08/01/israels-assassinations-outside-palestine-acled-insight/)
.

Despite the heavy exchanges, both sides still seem intent on avoiding a full-scale war, and the much-feared larger and more intense escalation was averted for the time being.

#### [Ameneh Mehvar](/author/amenehmehvar/)

Dr. While Israel’s preemptive strike likely prevented a large part of Hezbollah’s planned retaliation, the Lebanese group did not attempt to target civilians or use new tactics and weaponry, including precision missiles that could have triggered a much harsher Israeli retaliation. Early that morning, more than 100 Israel Defense Forces (IDF) jets launched airstrikes on approximately 40 locations in southern Lebanon. The group claimed to have successfully targeted 11 military bases in northern Israel and the occupied Golan Heights, as well as an intelligence unit in central Israel."

Israel and Hezbollah, the Lebanese militia backed by Iran, have engaged in [some of their heaviest cross-border air attacks](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/08/24/world/israel-hamas-gaza-war)
 in months. Israeli aircraft bombarded southern Lebanon on Sunday to stop what Israel said were preparations for a major Hezbollah attack. The Israeli news media circulates footage showing Israeli air defenses intercepting rockets fired from Lebanon and describes the barrage as longer than has been typical in the months of intensified launches by Hezbollah.

**6:09 a.m.:** Hezbollah [confirms](https://t.me/C_Military1/58135)
 that it launched an attack as part of an “initial response” to the Israeli assassination of Fuad Shukr, one of the group’s most senior commanders, last month. Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed Lebanese militia, later said it had fired hundreds of rockets and drones at Israel as retribution for Israel’s killing of a senior commander in July, though Israel said there had been little damage.

Why did Barcelona reverse its decision to cut ties with Israel?
===============================================================

In-depth: In February, Barcelona broke off ties with Israel, citing the systematic violation of Palestinian human rights. Seven months later, and with a new mayor in office, the twin city agreement with Tel Aviv has been restored.

On 1 September, the new mayor of the city of Barcelona - Jaume Collboni - signed a decree suspending a [decision by the previous administration](https://www.newarab.com/news/barcelona-cuts-ties-israel-over-palestinian-rights)
 to halt a twinning agreement with Tel Aviv and cut ties with Israel.

The initial decision in February to suspend relations represented a huge milestone for solidarity with Palestine from [city councils](https://www.newarab.com/analysis/how-local-politics-europe-driving-change-palestine)
 around the world.

After progressive Mayor Ada Colau declared it would cease cooperation with Israel and support Palestinians, other cities joined the call, such as the [Belgian city of Liege](https://www.brusselstimes.com/475641/city-of-liege-votes-to-boycott-the-state-of-israel)
 in April and [Brazil’s Belem](https://www.newarab.com/news/brazilian-mayor-declares-city-apartheid-free-zone)
 in May.

The move came after a campaign by more than a hundred civil society associations which, a few months after being launched, had not just reached but [surpassed](https://twitter.com/proucomplicitat/status/1603728347774816256)
 the number of signatures they needed for the request to be presented to the city council. 

After being approved, a [letter signed by dozens of prominent figures](https://www.lavanguardia.com/local/barcelona/20230214/8755440/cuatro-premios-nobel-medio-centenar-personalidades-internacionales-apoyan-ruptura-barcelona-israel-colau-tel-aviv.html)
, including four Nobel Prize winners and musicians, actors, and intellectuals from around the globe, praised the decision.

But just seven months on and following a contested May election campaign which saw the leader of the centre-left Socialist Party Jaume Collboni obtain a majority in the city council, the tide has turned.

> "The initial decision in February to suspend relations represented a huge milestone for solidarity with Palestine from city councils around the world"

**Legal harassment against institutions and activists**

On the same day that Ada Colau announced the temporary suspension of Barcelona’s twinning agreement with Tel Aviv and its ties to the state, the pro-Israel group ACOM - Action and Communication for the Middle East - [announced](https://a-com.es/acom-anuncia-acciones-legales-contra-ada-colau-y-el-ayuntamiento-de-barcelona-por-su-discriminacion-antisemita/)
 it would take legal measures against the mayoralty’s alleged “hate agenda and its unhealthy obsession against Jews and their state”. 

ACOM, founded in 2004, is the largest of a series of groups that claim their objective is to fight “discrimination against Jews and harassment towards Israel and its citizens”.

Although [self-defined](https://a-com.es/dossier/)
 as a secular and independent entity – reportedly supported by the help of civil society and private donors – the organisation is part of an umbrella of international [pro-Israel groups](https://a-com.es/somos-acom/)
 ranging from MEMRI, the Israeli Allies Foundation, and other influential groups in the United States and beyond.

“ACOM has engaged in intimidating activists and city councils since the Spanish Solidarity Network Against the Occupation of Palestine launched its Apartheid Free Spaces campaign back in 2015,” a Spanish activist and academic who requested anonymity due to a history of reprisals by these groups told _The New Arab_.

As ACOM details in its [press releases](https://a-com.es/acom-presenta-recurso-legal-contra-ayuntamiento-de-barcelona/)
, legal actions by the group have resulted in the annulation of 86 institutional agreements in solidarity with Palestine, and in 2016, ACOM’s sister association sought the prosecution of [eight activists](https://law4palestine.org/spain-acquits-8-bds-activists-of-hate-crimes-against-us-jewish-singer-matisyahu/)
 that called for the boycott of Jewish-American reggae artist Matisyahu at the Rototom Sunspalsh Festival, accused by a local BDS group of supporting Israel’s occupation.

In Barcelona, these groups carried out a huge legal campaign against the former mayor and her team, referring complaints to the [administrative courts](https://a-com.es/acom-presenta-recurso-legal-contra-ayuntamiento-de-barcelona/)
 and launching criminal proceedings for alleged hate crimes.

Marc Serra, a councillor in Barcelona’s city council and part of Ada Colau’s party ‘Barcelona En Comú’, told _The New Arab_ that despite the first complaint being filed, these groups have tried to use different legal pathways to achieve their objective.

“There is a pattern in which they file complaints in the courts, in the public prosecutor's office, in the national audience… until they find a judge who ends up agreeing with them or at least opens a way to investigate”.

As a lawyer himself, Serra claims that “we can talk about it as an abuse of the judicial system”. He adds that “what they have achieved is what they were looking for, the opening of criminal proceedings against the Mayor of Barcelona, who took a stand against apartheid towards the Palestinian people, as well as questioning any authority that could take a similar stand”.

**The Socialist Party and renewing ties**

For new Mayor Jaume Collboni and his team, the decision to renew Barcelona’s ties with Israel was not economically driven nor influenced by any interest group, according to officials.

Pau Solanilla, city promotion commissioner under Collboni’s administration and the person who announced the move, told _The New Arab_ that “there has been no pressure or encouragement because it was not necessary, we have been clear that dialogue, cooperation and city diplomacy are useful instruments to contribute to peace in the region”. 

On the same day that Ada Colau broke ties, Jaume Collboni [visited Barcelona’s synagogue](https://www.elperiodico.com/es/barcelona/20230215/maragall-llama-jaume-ii-provocador-83017210)
 to declare that, were he to be elected Mayor, he would reverse Colau’s decision. Yet, only two months later, the facts speak for themselves,” they said.

A man with a Palestinian flag pictured during a protest in Barcelona in 2015. “I think it is a very serious thing that these associations are using the discourse on human rights and the fight against discrimination after having ties with the extreme right, which is the one that goes against fundamental rights”.

In his official X account, and on behalf of his party, the city councillor also [reminded the Spanish public](https://twitter.com/MarcSerraSole/status/1697649555452440667)
 of the dangers to fundamental rights within Israel itself.

“Collboni has decided to "embrace" Israel when the state is going through its worst democratic crisis: governed by the far right, with a judicial reform that undermines the separation of powers and an increase in violence against the Palestinian population,” he wrote.

> "The signal being sent to Israel following Barcelona's recent decision is that 'everything is fine, and that there will be no retaliation for the daily and repeated violations against the Palestinians'"

**Impunity for Israel's occupation**

For Pau Solanilla, who speaks for his party’s recent decision to renew ties, the composition of Israel’s far-right government is concerning. They added that, “these crumbs do not provide a political solution to the Palestinian cause".

Israeli forces have killed at least [219 Palestinians](https://www.ochaopt.org/data/casualties)
 since the beginning of 2023 in the occupied West Bank, East Jerusalem, and Gaza Strip, making it the deadliest year since the UN began recording deaths in 2005.

For Laurent Cohen, a Jewish member of the Catalan Association of Jews and Palestinians, the signal being sent to Israel following Barcelona’s recent decision is that “everything is fine, and that there will be no retaliation for the daily and repeated violations against the Palestinians”.

Following the end of Barcelona's twin-city partnership with Tel Aviv earlier in February by Mayor Ada Colau, the Spanish soccer team FC Barcelona sent a statement of support for Israel on Thursday.

The president of the Barcelona football club, Joan Laporte, decided to convey a message of support for Israel after Colau cited claims that Israel was guilty of “[apartheid](https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/international/europe/1674201215-barcelona-to-vote-on-severing-ties-with-tel-aviv-over-israeli-apartheid "https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/international/europe/1674201215-barcelona-to-vote-on-severing-ties-with-tel-aviv-over-israeli-apartheid")

Representatives of Israeli Embassy with FC Barcelona PresidentIsraeli Embassy in Spain

Joan Laporta, president of the FC Barcelona soccer team, on Thursday sent a message of support for Israel, after [Barcelona announced](/news/367176)
 it would be cutting ties with Israel and ending its twin city agreement with Tel Aviv.

Laporta invited the representatives of the Israeli Embassy in Spain to the soccer match against Manchester United, and gave the Embassy representatives Barcelona shirts.

In a ceremony held before the game, Laporta emphasized the club's long-standing commitment to the excellent relations with the State of Israel and the people of Israel.

The Israeli diplomats presented Laporta with an Israeli flag and thanked him for years of support for Israel, friendship and joint activity in building a bridge between nations through sport.

The meeting comes a week after Barcelona Mayor Ada Colau stated that she is suspending all of the city’s ties with Israel, citing what she called “the repeated violations of human rights of the Palestinian population and non-compliance with United Nations resolutions.”

She added that Barcelona will maintain relations with “Israeli and Palestinian entities that continue to work for peace and against apartheid.”

Tourism Minister Haim Katz [sent a letter](/news/367204)
 to his Spanish counterpart, María Reyes Maroto Illera, asking her to reverse Barcelona’s decision.

The Palestinian Authority (PA) foreign affairs bureau, meanwhile, [welcomed Barcelona’s decision](/news/367241)
.

Barcelona’s city council this week [held a vote](/news/367511)
 rejecting Colau’s stated intention last week to un-twin the city with Tel Aviv and cut ties with Israel, but the vote was only symbolic, as council members do not have the power to veto Colau’s decision.

 as a replacement for Barcelona.

In a letter to Tel Aviv Mayor Ron Huldai and during a press conference, Martínez-Almeida said the twinning is a “great opportunity to show Madrid’s commitment to strengthening relations with a democratic and a law-abiding state like Israel.”

Protesters wave Israeli national flags in support of soldiers being questioned for detainee abuse, outside of the Sde Teiman military base, on Monday, July 29, 2024 \[Tsafrir Abayov/AP\]

By [Simon Speakman Cordall](/author/simon-speakman-cordall)

Published On 9 Aug 20249 Aug 2024

Video has emerged of a gang rape of a Palestinian prisoner by guards at the Sde Teiman detention facility in the Negev desert, southern Israel.

The video, which has been verified by Al Jazeera, shows the prisoner being selected from a larger group lying bound on the floor. Some observers, including a local rights group and two UN agencies, have voiced concerns about the treatment of Palestinian prisoners.

However, for some, including the country’s far-right finance minister, the outrage has centred on the “crime” of recording the video, rather than the alleged rape itself.

Taking to X, formerly Twitter, on Thursday night, Bezalel Smotrich demanded “an immediate criminal investigation to locate the leakers of the trending video that was intended to harm the reservists and that caused tremendous damage to Israel in the world and to exhaust the full severity of the law against them”.

Others, including the hard right and ultranationalist politicians, such as National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, within Israel, have argued that any action – even gang rape – is permissible if it is undertaken for the security of the state.

Defending the indefensible
--------------------------

Following the arrest of the reservists on July 29, far-right mobs, some of which included government ministers, stormed the facility at Sde Teiman in southern Israel later the same day.

Unable to find and free the imprisoned soldiers, they then turned to the base at Beit Lid, 60km away, where the soldiers were being held for questioning, to call for the soldiers’ release.

That unrest continued during a high court hearing, convened on Wednesday to hear the petitions of Sde Teiman prisoners who are alleged to have been tortured. The same day, Smotrich, who had been among the right-wing mob to storm the prison, published a video message, saying that “IDF soldiers deserve respect” and must not be treated as “criminals”.

On being asked by Ahmad Tibi, one of the Arab MPs within the Israeli Knesset last week if it was legitimate “to insert a stick into a person’s rectum”, Hanoch Milwidsky, a member of Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu’s ruling Likud party, [responded](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israel-hamas-war-idf-palestinian-prisoner-alleged-rape-sde-teinman-abuse-protest/)
: “If he is a Nukhba \[Hamas militant\], everything is legitimate to do! This kind of abuse is systematic,” he said.

‘At odds with international law’
--------------------------------

Allegations of the systematic abuse of prisoners within a justice system which critics say is fundamentally at odds with international law have also been detailed in a separate report published on Monday by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCR), and in an [unpublished report](/news/2024/3/13/after-the-unrwa-report-more-accounts-of-israels-torture-in-gaza)
 – seen by Al Jazeera in March – from the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA).

Responding to warnings of overcrowding within the prison system from the security agency Shin Bet in early July, Ben-Gvir repeated his call for Palestinian prisoners to be executed, tweeting that one of his principal goals since attaining office had been to “worsen the conditions of the terrorists in the prisons, and to reduce their rights to the minimum required by law”.

He said: “Everything published about the abominable conditions” of the Palestinians being held in Israeli prisons “was true”.

Human rights up for debate
--------------------------

The United States, Israel’s principal ally, called the allegations of sexual abuse of Palestinian prisoners “horrific”, saying Israel must investigate “swiftly” and “fully”.

State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told the media on Wednesday: “There ought to be zero tolerance for sexual abuse, rape of any detainee. Peter Stano, a spokesperson for the EU’s diplomatic service, told Politico: “The EU is gravely concerned by the allegations of human rights violations and abuses, including torture and sexual abuse of Palestinian detainees at the Sde Teiman military facility in Israel and elsewhere.”

Nevertheless, many within Israel continue to defend the conditions in which Palestinian prisoners are being held, as well as the rape alleged to have been carried out by the soldiers at Sde Teiman.

“Look, the question really isn’t about rape,” Ori Goldberg, a Tel Aviv-based political analyst, told Al Jazeera. The victim is then escorted to a wall, where guards, using their shields to hide their identity from the camera, proceed to rape him.

The attack is believed to have been so brutal that, after he was transferred to hospital, Israeli media reported that the [victim was unable to walk](/news/2024/7/29/israeli-far-right-politicians-protest-arrest-of-soldiers-suspected-of-abuse)
.

Ten soldiers were ultimately arrested for the rape on July 29, in a case that has rocked Israeli society. The proceedings were interrupted by demonstrators, who included victims of the October 7 Hamas-led attack, who shouted “Disgrace” and “We are the sovereign”.

Israeli pressure group Guarding the Soldiers – a new organisation formed in defence of the soldiers accused of rape – was quoted in Israeli media as saying: “The hearing in the high court this morning is absurd and a gift to \[Hamas leader Yahya\] Sinwar and murderers.”

Israeli politicians, including cabinet members, have also defended the accused. Everything!”

‘Just the tip of the iceberg’
-----------------------------

The video of the alleged gang rape at Sde Teiman is the latest piece in a growing body of evidence of abuse, sexual assault and the systematic withholding of food and medical care that Palestinians endure within the Israeli prison system.

A report titled Welcome to Hell, published this week by the Israeli human rights advocacy group, B’Tselem, includes interviews with 55 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli detention centres since October 7. The soldiers belong to a unit known as Force 100, which is tasked with guarding the Sde Teiman facility, according to Haaretz.

Military prosecutors released three of the arrested soldiers on August 4, adding to the two previously released by investigators following a military court hearing in Kfar Yona on July 30, at which protesters gathered in support of the soldiers under arrest.

The video has shocked many within Israeli society. In firsthand accounts, the prisoners, the majority of whom were later released without charge at locations across the occupied Palestinian territory, Gaza and within Israel, recount being assaulted, insulted and sexually abused by guards.

“The conditions at Sde Teiman aren’t unique."

According to a Reuters translation, the screenshot shows 65% of Jewish Israelis answered: “They should be dealt with disciplinarily at the command level only.” An estimated 21% answered: “They should be brought to criminal trial," while 14% answered: “I don’t know.” None of the answers in the screenshot mention “rape” or “Palestinian prisoners,” and no other results in the survey support the claims made in the social media post."

Content: "Israelis have been rattled by the events, which have highlighted the deep political divisions in the country.

A member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party, speaking Monday at a meeting of lawmakers, justified the rape and abuse of Palestinian prisoners, shouting angrily at colleagues questioning the alleged behavior that anything was legitimate to do to "terrorists" in custody.

Lawmaker Hanoch Milwidsky was asked as he defended the alleged abuse whether it was legitimate, "to insert a stick into a person's rectum?"

"Yes!" he shouted in reply to his fellow parliamentarian. Jill Gralow/REUTERS

Other senior Israeli officials, however, including Netanyahu and army commander Lieutenant-General Herzi Halevi, condemned the attack on the army base by the far-right protesters.

"Breaking into a military base and disturbing the order there is severe behavior that is not acceptable in any way," Halevi said in a statement, adding: "We are in the midst of a war and actions of this type endanger the security of the state."

Netanyahu called for calm, adding his own strong condemnation of the protesters for attempting to break into the IDF base, while Defense Minister Yoav Gallant warned that "even in difficult times, the law applies to anyone — nobody may trespass into IDF bases or violate the laws of the state of Israel."

United Nations agencies and human rights organizations, along with officials in Hamas-run Gaza and former prisoners interviewed by international news agencies, have all alleged abuse of Palestinians in Israeli detention facilities.

Israel's military insists that its detention centers are run in accordance with international law.

The soldiers suspected of the abuse have been held for questioning, which is rare in Israel during an ongoing conflict, and it has drawn a furious reaction from far-right Israelis, including some senior government officials. On Monday evening, a group of Israelis attempted to storm another military facility, with one protester threatening an uprising against the government if the suspects remain in custody.

You are provided with the record of a fact-check. It contains the Claim to be verified and a documentation of all the fact-checking work along the gathered evidence. Your task is to **summarize the fact-check**. That is, you provide a concise, one-paragraph justification for the final VERDICT based on the knowledge from the Record. Note:
* Be truthful, brief, do not add any additional information besides the information given in the Record. 
* Link key sources in your summary. Use Markdown notation for that. You may link them in-line.
* Don't state the Claim again. Rather focus on the key insights of the fact-check.
* Simply print just the summary.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:54> The image shows a screenshot of an authentic question from Israel's Channel 12 public opinion poll: 'Do you agree with the claim that a solder is allowed to rape a prisoner with his hands tied?'"

## Actions
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results include an article from Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/9/everything-is-legitimate-israeli-leaders-defend-soldiers-accused-of-rape](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/9/everything-is-legitimate-israeli-leaders-defend-soldiers-accused-of-rape)) discussing the gang rape of a Palestinian prisoner and the defense of the soldiers involved by some Israeli politicians. A Reuters fact-check ([https://www.inss.org.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Fact-Check-Israeli-opinion-poll-mistranslated-as-saying-soldiers-%E2%80%98should-rape-prisoners-poll-conducted-by-Mora-Deitch-Rebecca-Meller-Idit-Shafran-and-Anat-Shapira-in-Reuters-for-site-.pdf](https://www.inss.org.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Fact-Check-Israeli-opinion-poll-mistranslated-as-saying-soldiers-%E2%80%98should-rape-prisoners-poll-conducted-by-Mora-Deitch-Rebecca-Meller-Idit-Shafran-and-Anat-Shapira-in-Reuters-for-site-.pdf)) clarifies a mistranslation of an Israeli opinion poll, stating that the original poll did not ask about the acceptability of rape. A CBS News article ([https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israel-hamas-war-idf-palestinian-prisoner-alleged-rape-sde-teinman-abuse-protest/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israel-hamas-war-idf-palestinian-prisoner-alleged-rape-sde-teinman-abuse-protest/)) discusses the detention of IDF reservists suspected of rape and abuse, and mentions that some senior government officials justified the abuse.

The Al Jazeera article includes images <image:1>, <image:2>. The Reuters fact-check includes an image <image:54>. The CBS News article includes images <image:2296>, <image:2297>.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests the claim is based on a mistranslation. The Reuters fact-check ([https://www.inss.org.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Fact-Check-Israeli-opinion-poll-mistranslated-as-saying-soldiers-%E2%80%98should-rape-prisoners-poll-conducted-by-Mora-Deitch-Rebecca-Meller-Idit-Shafran-and-Anat-Shapira-in-Reuters-for-site-.pdf](https://www.inss.org.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Fact-Check-Israeli-opinion-poll-mistranslated-as-saying-soldiers-%E2%80%98should-rape-prisoners-poll-conducted-by-Mora-Deitch-Rebecca-Meller-Idit-Shafran-and-Anat-Shapira-in-Reuters-for-site-.pdf)) clarifies that the original poll did not ask about the acceptability of rape. The image in the claim is present in the Reuters fact-check.


## Final Judgement
The claim misrepresents the content of the poll. The original poll's question was mistranslated, leading to a false interpretation.

`misleading`

The military will send one additional squadron of Air Force F-22 fighter jets, an unspecified number of additional Navy cruisers and destroyers capable of intercepting ballistic missiles, and, if needed, more land-based ballistic-missile defense systems.

To maintain the presence of an aircraft carrier and its accompanying warships in the region, Mr. Austin also directed the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln, now in the eastern Pacific, to relieve the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt in the next couple of weeks when it is scheduled to return home.

Some ships already in the western Mediterranean Sea will move east, closer to the coast of Israel to provide more security, a senior Pentagon official said.

As of Monday, _Lincoln_ was operating in the vicinity of Hawaii following [its July 11 deployment](https://news.usni.org/2024/07/12/carrier-uss-abraham-lincoln-leaves-on-deployment-uss-theodore-roosevelt-now-in-the-middle-east)

The ARG, composed of USS _Wasp_ (LHD-1), USS _New York_ (LPD-21) and USS _Oak Hill_ (LSD-51), and the 24th MEU are in position in the event of a non-combatant evacuation of people from Lebanon, several defense officials have told USNI News.

The Pentagon also announced the deployment of unspecified fighter squadrons headed to the region.

“The Secretary of Defense has reiterated that the United States will protect our personnel and interests in the region, including our ironclad commitment to the defense of Israel,” reads the statement from the Pentagon.

KIEL, Germany (June 19, 2024) – The Blue Ridge-class command and control ship USS Mount Whitney (LCC 20) arrived in Kiel, Germany, for a scheduled port visit, June 19, 2024.  
  
The ship’s visit to Kiel completes its participation in Baltic Operations (BALTOPS) 24, and builds on the strong and enduring relationship between the United States and Germany. BALTOPS 24 is an annual joint, multinational maritime-focused exercise designed to enhance interoperability, capability, and cohesion among NATO Allies while maintaining freedom of navigation and defending the Baltic Sea region. USS Mount Whitney’s visit to Kiel marks the culmination of its participation in BALTOPS 24 as it travels across the Baltic Sea.  
  
During the USS Mount Whitney’s port visit, Sailors, Marines, and key leaders from the Baltic Region participated in a Post-Sail conference at the Kiel Naval Base, where the discussions centered around capturing the lessons learned from BALTOPS 24, as well as beginning to shape the subsequent iterations of BALTOPS. BALTOPS is an annual training exercise in the Baltic region, with each year building off of the progress from the previous years.  
  
For the duration of BALTOPS 24, Task Force 61/2 (TF 61/2) and Expeditionary Strike Group 2 (ESG-2) combined together as Commander Task Force 162 (CTF 162). CTF 162 was aboard the USS Mount Whitney, which served as the command and control center for the amphibious assault ship USS Wasp (LHD 1), the San Antonio-class amphibious transport dock USS New York (LPD 21) and embarked 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU), Special Operations Capable (SOC), all together referred to as the Wasp ARG-24th MEU (SOC). Embarked commands with the Wasp ARG consist of Amphibious Squadron Four, 24th MEU (SOC), Fleet Surgical Team 2, Tactical Air Control Squadron 22, Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron 28 and Beach Assault Unit 21.  
  
TF 61/2 was also working closely with NATO Allies throughout BALTOPS 24, to include members of the Spanish Navy aboard the multi-purpose amphibious assault ship-aircraft carrier Juan Carlos I (L 61), the Royal Netherlands Navy aboard the HNLMS Johan de Witt (L 801), and the French Navy aboard the Mistral class amphibious assault and command ship (L 9013).  
  
“The purpose of this \[BALTOPS\] is to enhance our relationships, it’s to continue to build on our interoperability, it’s to showcase the fact that we are committed to this Alliance, and that we are committed to maintaining maritime peace and stability in the Baltic region,” said Brig. Gen. Samuel Meyer, the Commanding General of TF 61/2, who served as the Commander, Landing Forces (CLF) for CTF 162 during BALTOPS 24. “We are indeed stronger together.”  
  
For the last two weeks, TF 61/2 and ESG-2 were underway on the USS Mount Whitney participating in BALTOPS 24. As one of NATO’s premier maritime-focused exercises, BALTOPS 24 aimed to enhance interoperability and cooperation among allied nations in a complex and dynamic maritime environment. BALTOPS 24 was divided into two at-sea training phases. Combat Enhancement Training (CET) and Force Integration Training (FIT) comprised the first phase, followed by the Final Tactical Phase of the Exercise (TACEX). During the CET/FIT phase, ships and aircraft rehearsed common tactics, techniques, and procedures under a scripted program of events, enabling them to safely operate together as a force. The exercise culminated with the TACEX phase, where forces shifted into a “free-play” portion, and commanders were given more freedom to run their own tactical programs. The TACEX phase was designed to better represent operating in real-world situations.  
  
Participating nations included Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Türkiye, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The exercise, in its 53rd iteration, provided a unique training opportunity that strengthened combined response capabilities critical to preserving the freedom of navigation and security in the Baltic Sea region. Participating nations exercised a myriad of capabilities that demonstrated the inherent flexibility of maritime forces, including amphibious operations, gunnery, anti-submarine, and air defense exercises, as well as mine clearance operations, explosive ordnance disposal, and diving and salvage operations.  
  
“What we practice together is the ability to be interoperable with NATO, and this is a fantastic thing that I believe NATO does better than anyone else, and it really showcases the ability to work together,” says Rear Adm. Benjamin Nicholson, the commander of ESG-2, serving as the Commander, Amphibious Task Force (CATF) for CTF 162 during BALTOPS 24. “This really highlights the interoperability of NATO, where we can take forces from one nation, and put them on a ship or in a country of another nation, and operate from there seamlessly. That’s our strength when we partner and work together because we are stronger together.”  
  
Unique to BALTOPS 24 was Sweden participating for the first time as a member of NATO. Sweden had participated in previous iterations of BALTOPS as a NATO partner, but BALTOPS 24 was the first time that Sweden participated as an official member of NATO. This year also included a robust medical training package, together with a mass casualty medical drill on several of the ships underway, complete with role players simulating injuries wearing realistic makeup that were treated by the ship’s corpsman and medical officers, showcasing the medical readiness of the ships’ medical teams. Additionally, BALTOPS 24 included a larger chaplaincy contribution in the exercise that was expanded to six participating nations, integrating the chaplains in the military exercises to practice spiritually supporting our key warfare advantage: our service members. Chaplains from Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Netherlands, Norway, Romania, and the United States participated in the exercise, and conducted several cross-deckings to other NATO surface ships, where they met with the service members on board and led religious services.  
  
These various training evolutions contributed to this year’s successful iteration of BALTOPS 24. Participants in this multinational maritime exercise created and sustained partnerships and practiced a broad range of mission areas to enhance the capabilities of the participating units. More importantly, this exercise strengthened their ability to operate as a cohesive joint and combined force and respond to emerging crises.  
  
Headquartered in Naples, Italy, U.S. Naval Forces Europe-Africa (NAVEUR-NAVAF) operates U.S. naval forces in the U.S. European Command (USEUCOM) and U.S. Africa Command (USAFRICOM) areas of responsibility. U.S. Sixth Fleet is permanently assigned to NAVEUR-NAVAF, and employs maritime forces through the full spectrum of joint and naval operations.  
  
For more than 80 years, NAVEUR-NAVAF has forged strategic relationships with Allies and partners, leveraging a foundation of shared values to preserve security and stability.

BALTOP24 ships at sea

240608-N-JC445-1024 BALTIC SEA (June 8, 2024) Ships participating in exercise Baltic Operations 2024 (BALTOPS 24) steam in formation through the Baltic Sea, June 8, 2024. BALTOPS24 is the premier maritime-focused exercise in the Baltic Region. The exercise, led by U.S. Naval Forces Europe-Africa and executed by Naval Striking and Support Forces NATO, provides a unique training opportunity to strengthen combined response capabilities critical to preserving freedom of navigation and security in the Baltic Sea.

BALTIC SEA  –  

Twenty NATO Allies concluded the 53rd iteration of exercise Baltic Operations 2024 (BALTOPS-24) in Kiel, Germany, June 20, 2024.

During their time in port, Allies gathered to reflect on the accomplishments and success achieved throughout the 21-day Baltic Region exercise involving more than 50 ships, 85 aircraft, and approximately 9,000 personnel.

Vice Adm. Thomas Ishee, Commander of Naval Striking and Support Forces NATO (STRIKFORNATO) and U.S. 6th Fleet, reflected on the critical nature of the NATO Alliance in the region, and how integral BALTOPS-24 is in advancing Allies' shared objectives in the Baltic.

"BALTOPS-24 is not only the largest iteration in its 53-year history, but the first in nearly 30 years that all participants are NATO Allies," Vice Adm. Ishee said. "NATO Nations account for nearly all 8,000 km of Baltic coastline. That's eight of nine Baltic Sea Nations who share values for Freedom of Navigation and the legitimate use of the Baltic Sea.

The exercise began with a pre-sail conference June 4 in Klaipeda, Lithuania, where exercise staff and senior leaders met to finalize the scenario and operations, and discuss the unique maritime challenges and opportunities of the Baltic Region.

"Beginning in 1972, BALTOPS continues to build trust, foster understanding and enhanced interoperability across the maritime, air, land, and space domains," said Vice Adm. Ishee. "But more importantly, the gathering of so many nations demonstrates our collective strength, resolve and commitment to Baltic Sea regional security."

June 8 marked the beginning of the underway portion of exercise, with 30 NATO warships sailing alongside each other in one of the largest maritime formations in the region's history.

This year saw the largest assembled coalition of amphibious forces in the Baltic Sea, with four Amphibious Task Groups (ATG) and Multinational Task Units exercising amphibious capabilities in Skrunda, Latvia; Gotland, Sweden; Utska, Poland; and Putlos, Germany. Each area presented unique challenges to integrated amphibious operations, which were leveraged by the multinational amphibious assault teams to practice competencies together.

At-sea, the U.S. Navy amphibious assault ship USS Wasp (LHD 1), and San Antonio-class amphibious transport dock ship USS New York (LPD 21), the Spanish Navy aircraft carrier Juan Carlos I (L 61), and the French Navy amphibious assault ship FS Mistral (L 9013) were central to the integration of BALTOPS-24 amphibious capabilities. On land, armed forces from more than eight NATO nations conducted urban warfare training; tactical recovery of personnel; aerial insertions; beach landings; forest navigation; deployment of M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System; free-jumping into simulated contested territory and full-scale amphibious assaults on an opposing force.

"\[BALTOPS-24\] is a multidisciplinary exercise, comprising several warfare domains. specifically, amphibious operations, which is a very important part of LHD Mistral," said French Navy Capt. Olivier Roussille, commanding officer of the FS Mistral. "The objective \[of the exercise\] is to contribute to NATO reassurance in the area, and build a sustainable legacy to the benefit of collective defense, while strengthening our ties and interoperability with the Allied navy sailors."

This iteration of BALTOPS-24 also hosted the largest assembled coalition of mine countermeasure (MCM) forces in NATO, leading to a robust docket of MCM activity throughout the 21-day exercise. Deploying more than 700 personnel, 20 surface ships, 20 unmanned systems, and two MH-60S Seahawk helicopters, Swedish, French, Norwegian, Dutch, and U.S. forces scanned the seabed to develop an operating picture, practiced locating mines with surface assets, deployed the Airborne Mine Neutralization System for aerial mine recovery, and finalized their multinational MCM collaboration with an MCM combat rehearsal.

"BALTOPS allows us to sharpen the sword of our MCM capabilities, but also brings together all of the NATO partners that may go in and remove that mine threat," Capt. Scott Hattaway, director of Naval Surface and Mine Warfighting Development Center (SMWDC), and lead for all MCM activity during BALTOPS 24. "No one country goes into an MCM operation by themselves. We practice now as an international cohort in order to prepare for when we do it for real."

At sea, NATO warships conducted tactical maneuvering drills, anti-submarine warfare training, gunnery and small caliber live fire events, and air defense exercises. Of significant note, the alliance practiced the integration of medical capabilities, with the USS Wasp, USS New York, the Royal Netherlands Navy Rotterdam class landing platform dock ship HNLMS Johan de Witt (L 801), and the Spanish Navy aircraft carrier Juan Carlos I (L 61) simulating a mass casualty drill and patient transfers between vessels.

In addition to medical readiness, the NATO team also practiced the integration of its spiritual readiness staff. Seventeen chaplains, Religious Program Specialists, and assistants from 10 NATO nations participated in a conference aboard the USS Mount Whitney to learn about NATO Spiritual Support Interoperability (SSI) initiatives. Later, Dutch, Finnish and U.S. chaplains would meet aboard the HNLMS Johan de Witt to discuss how multinational chaplains could support a multinational force.

Also at-sea, Royal Navy, Lithuanian Navy, and U.S. Navy service members conducted joint personnel recovery operations. During the operation, a Royal Navy small craft placed both a mannequin and a Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape (SERE) specialist into the Baltic Sea. After receiving a simulated recovery request, Lithuanian Navy Ship LNS Skalvis (P14) recovered the dummy, a MH-60S Sea Hawk helicopter attached to HSC-28 deployed a rescue swimmer into the water and recovered the live survivor, who then was dropped off onto one of the Royal Navy vessels, HMS Example.

All of these events - whether at-sea, ashore, or in the air - were planned and coordinated by a substantial multinational coalition of liaison officers and augmentees operating out of the STRIKFORNATO headquarters in Oeiras, Portugal. These liaison officers were the conduit through which directives, intelligence, and requests flowed, bridging the gap between command levels, operational units, and supporting elements, and acting as the beating heart of exercise BALTOPS-24.

Of special significance, for the first time in BALTOPS history, nearly all of the 8,000 kilometers of the Baltic Coastline is safeguarded by NATO Allies. This is only possible due to the accession of Finland in 2023, and the more recent accession of Sweden on March 7, 2024.

"Since we joined three months ago, it's important for Sweden to show that we, as a nation, contribute to the security and stability in the Baltic Sea region as it is our home turf as well," says Lt. Tobias Irebro, liaison officer with the Swedish Navy. "It also lets us show that we are a willing contributor as a newly joined ally. It's also very important for the Baltic countries to exercise security and stability in the region as they depend on the sea as a main logistics asset for importing and exporting."

Looking towards the future, preparations have already begun for next year's exercise, which will take into account the valuable lessons gleaned from BALTOPS-24 and aim to expand upon its achievements in BALTOPS-25.

STRIKFORNATO, headquartered at Oeiras, Portugal, is a rapidly deployable and scalable headquarters, under the operational command of SACEUR, capable of planning and executing full spectrum joint maritime operations including maritime Ballistic Missile Defence, primarily through integration of U.S. and other nations' carrier and amphibious forces into NATO operations to provide assurance, deterrence, and collective defence for the Alliance.

Headquartered in Naples, Italy, NAVEUR-NAVAF operates U.S. naval forces in the U.S. European Command (USEUCOM) and U.S. Africa Command (USAFRICOM) areas of responsibility. U.S. Sixth Fleet is permanently assigned to NAVEUR-NAVAF, and employs maritime forces through the full spectrum of joint and combined naval operations.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
In August 2024, the U.S. military sent additional combat aircraft and warships to the Middle East in response to threats from Iran and its proxies to attack Israel, according to The New York Times ([https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/02/world/middleeast/us-iran-israel-aircraft.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/02/world/middleeast/us-iran-israel-aircraft.html)). Some ships already in the western Mediterranean Sea will move east, closer to the coast of Israel.

L'Orient Today reported on July 31, 2024, that the U.S. sent warships to the Mediterranean, including the USS Wasp, USS New York, and USS Oak Hill (<image:i>) ([https://today.lorientlejour.com/article/1422223/which-american-warships-are-en-route-to-lebanon.html](https://today.lorientlejour.com/article/1422223/which-american-warships-are-en-route-to-lebanon.html)). USNI News reported on August 2, 2024, that the USS Abraham Lincoln is heading to the Middle East (<image:2308>) ([https://news.usni.org/2024/08/02/carrier-uss-abraham-lincoln-heads-to-middle-east-as-iran-threatens-strikes-against-israel](https://news.usni.org/2024/08/02/carrier-uss-abraham-lincoln-heads-to-middle-east-as-iran-threatens-strikes-against-israel)).

Israel will not be invited to a ceremony in Japan commemorating the 1945 atomic bombing of Nagasaki city, according to Japanese news agency Kyodo News, which cited the city’s mayor Shiro Suzuki.

In June, Suzuki sent a letter to Israel calling for a ceasefire in Gaza, leaving an invitation to the annual peace ceremony on hold due to a risk of “unexpected situations” such as protests, according to Kyodo News.

At a press conference on Wednesday, Suzuki said he had not seen any changes that would lessen those risks ahead of the August 9 ceremony promoting world peace.

Israel’s Ambassador to Japan, Gilad Cohen, described the decision as “regrettable” in a post on X, adding it “sends a wrong message to the world.” 

In contrast, Hiroshima has invited Israel to its annual ceremony on August 6, a decision that’s been controversial with activists and atomic bomb survivors’ groups that say Israel should be excluded this year as Russia and Belarus have been for the past two years over Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.

Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei speaks after casting his vote for the presidential runoff election on July 5 in Tehran, Iran.

Majid Saeedi/Getty Images/File

Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has issued an order for Iran to “strike Israel directly” following the killing of Hamas’ political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran overnight, [according to the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/31/world/middleeast/iran-orders-attack-israel.html)
. 

The Times, citing information it said was provided by three Iranian officials familiar with the order, said the directive was given during an emergency meeting for Iran’s Supreme National Security Council Wednesday. 

The New York Times said the officials asked not to be named because they did not have the authority to speak publicly. The report did not say how or when any strike would be carried out.

Earlier, Khamenei said it was Iran’s “duty” to avenge Haniyeh’s death since he was killed inside Iran. 

“You killed our dear guest in our house and now have paved the way for your harsh punishment,” he said in a statement, referring to Israel.

CNN reviewed statements by Hamas and others, in addition to state media outlets and other social media posts, to analyze and track the Islamist militant group leader Ismail Haniyeh’s movements since October 7, 2023.

After he celebrated seeing his fighters return to the Gaza Strip with Israeli equipment in Hamas’ office in Istanbul, Turkey on October 7, Ismail Haniyeh spent the majority of his time in Doha as head of Hamas’ Political Bureau but took a number of trips to Tehran, Istanbul and Cairo, according to a CNN analysis.

**Tehran:** Haniyeh took at least four trips to Tehran – in November, March, May and July. During all four visits, he met with Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.

In May, he attended the funerals of Iranian president Ebrahim Raisi and foreign minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, who were killed in a helicopter crash. 

On his final trip to Tehran, which ended with his assassination, he was attending the inauguration of the new Iranian president Masoud Pezeshkian.

**Cairo:** He also took three known trips to Cairo in November, December and February, to lead Hamas’ ceasefire negotiating delegation. That negotiation process, which is still ongoing, has been shepherded by Qatar and Egypt.  

**Doha:** As war ravaged Gaza, Haniyeh spent the majority of his time in Hamas’ Doha offices. While there, press statements from Hamas indicate he repeatedly met with a number of foreign dignitaries, gave speeches and held meetings.

Doha is also where Haniyeh issued his first statement after his three sons, and four grandchildren were killed in Gaza by an Israeli airstrike. In that statement from mid-April, he said that such killings will only make Hamas more steadfast in its principles, adding that Hamas will not surrender, will not compromise, no matter how great the sacrifice.

Temporary flight restrictions have been issued in Tehran ahead of a memorial procession on Thursday for assassinated Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh.

The notice issued by Iran’s Civil Aviation Organisation restricts flight movements within a 2-kilometer (0.6-mile) circle radius centered at the University of Tehran.

Flight restrictions will be in place from 6 a.m. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied being behind Haniyeh’s assassination.

Wood said that although the US was not involved with Israel’s response on July 30 in Lebanon, “there is no doubt absolutely none that Hezbollah was responsible for this attack, which used an Iranian weapon and was launched from a portion of Lebanon controlled by Hezbollah.”

A relative of a hostage still being held in Gaza has said it is “hard to see” how the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh will help advance the deal to secure the release of the remaining hostages. 

Sharone Lifschitz, whose 83-year-old father Oded has been held in Gaza since October 7, said that she trusted statements from Qatari meditators on Wednesday warning that Haniyeh’s killing “doesn’t help” the talks between Israel and Hamas. 

She told CNN that her confidence is waning in the ability of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to broker a deal to return the hostages. Lifschitz’s 85-year-old mother was previously released from captivity in Gaza.

Netanyahu’s priority now, according to Lifschitz, is not securing the release of the hostages but rather shoring up his own “political survival.” She said she has “no sympathy” for Netanyahu himself, only for the hostages, their families, and the “innocent civilians caught up in this nightmare.” 

“Our loved ones are not here. In remarks Wednesday, a defiant Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to keep fighting, saying his country has delivered “crushing blows” to its enemies.

The Al Qassam Brigades said it was “the beginning of a swift response to the cowardly assassination of our great national leader, the martyr Ismail Haniyeh.”

“Hebron will lead the way in carrying out qualitative operations in the coming days, by the will of Allah,” it added.

HAMAS USING WHATSAPP TO COLLECT INTELLIGENCE ON IDF MOVEMENTS
=============================================================

![Hamas Chief Ismail Haniyeh attends a meeting with members of international media in Gazaa](https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy/t_Article2016_ControlFaceDetect/442230)

Hamas has once again been trying to obtain intelligence from Israeli troops stationed along the Gaza border using online messaging applications.

Posing as fellow soldiers, Hamas operatives contacted troops on the WhatsApp text messaging service and would ask for intelligence such as troop movements.

One combat soldier serving in the Paratrooper’s brigade received a text message on WhatsApp from an unknown person asking him to send the dates of the next exercises the brigade was expecting to hold in the coming months and when the troops were scheduled to leave the area.

Despite the Hamas operative sending the soldier information on the brigade, likely taken from another soldier the operative contacted, the paratrooper did not divulge any intelligence and alerted his commanders.

According to Ynet news, an investigation was launched into how the Hamas operative got his hands on the classified information.

The IDF Spokesperson’s Unit acknowledged the efforts by Hamas to collect intelligence from soldiers, saying in a statement that “The IDF is aware of the enemy’s activity and is following its efforts over social media. According to the army, there have been hundreds of reports of suspicious individuals approaching soldiers online since January 2017.

The military first uncovered Hamas’s attempt to honeypot male soldiers online that January in an operation dubbed “Hunter’s Network,” where dozens of accounts on social networks like Facebook were identified as being operated with false or stolen identities, with the intent to extract classified information from both regular and reservist soldiers.

The IDF’s Military Intelligence Directorate later launched “Operation Heartbreaker” and uncovered another cell behind suspicious online actions targeting soldiers on social networks as well as on messaging applications such as WhatsApp, using Israeli numbers to get soldiers to download applications from Google’s official store.

The military urged troops to only confirm friendship requests from people they know personally, to not upload any classified information to any social network, and to only download applications from the original App Store (rather than downloading applications from links).

Troops were also warned that if they were approached by a stranger online, to be aware that it might be an attempt to honeypot them, especially if the suspicious individual is unable to meet in person.

The IDF has urged all soldiers, including reserve soldiers, to report to their commander and to security officials if the suspicious individual asks them to download applications and if they feel that their phone may have been compromised.

[![](/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/holcoursepopup.png)](/help-end-antisemitism-2507dmpcp/) We call on all military and civilian personnel to act carefully and responsibly.

“We would like to point out that this year marks the anniversary of Operation Heartbreaker, in which the IDF exposed Hamas activity against IDF soldiers on social networks. The operation contributed greatly to raising the awareness and alertness of the soldiers, which is also reflected in the current event,” the military added.

The IDF recently launched two operations uncovering networks of Hamas operatives trying to lure in soldiers through smartphone applications."

TEHRAN – Ismail Haniyeh's son has brought attention to the possible involvement of WhatsApp in the assassination of the Hamas leader in Iran, noting that his father was communicating with family members through the American messaging app at least a few hours before his martyrdom. 

“My father regularly used WhatsApp to keep in touch with our family,” Abdul Salam Haniyeh said in an interview with Arab media. Ismail Haniyeh used WhatsApp just before assassination, son says
----------------------------------------------------------------

1. Some {media outlets\] have been talking about a huge security gap \[in Iran\] or infiltration”

Technology conglomerate Meta, which owns WhatsApp, has been under fire for facilitating Israel’s propaganda campaign and crackdown on Palestinian voices protesting the regime’s ongoing genocide in Gaza for the past ten months. Some reports suggest Meta has been working in close cooperation with the American government to help identify targets sought by Israel.

The Israeli regime assassinated Haniyeh in a Tehran residence on July 31, only hours after he had attended the inauguration ceremony of Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian. The Palestinian leader was targeted by a short-range missile whose warhead weighed 7 kilograms, according to a statement by the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps. 

Some Western media outlets like the New York Times and the Telegraph have claimed to have talked to unidentified “sources” inside Iran, who told them that Haniyeh was killed by a bomb installed inside his room by IRGC members working for the Mossad. The claims have been refuted numerous times, and are seen as a way to make Iran’s potential military action against the regime unjustifiable. 

Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei has vowed to avenge Haniyeh’s blood. Multiple Iranian officials have reiterated the promise in the past days, with analysts suggesting that other Resistance forces like Lebanon’s Hezbollah and Yemen’s Ansarullah may join Tehran in its retaliation.

The Palestinian digital rights group Sada Social on Saturday [called for](https://sada.social/post/sd-soshal-ydaao-l-thkyk-aaagl-ofory-ltsryb-myta-byanat-mstkhdmy-oatsab-l-algysh-alsrayly)
 an investigation into Israel’s alleged use of WhatsApp user data to target Palestinians with its AI system, Lavender.

The group, which is affiliated with the Al Jazeera Media Institute and Access Now, accused Meta, which owns WhatsApp, of fueling “the ‘Lavender’ artificial intelligence system used by the Israeli military to kill Palestinian individuals within the [Gaza](https://www.commondreams.org/tag/gaza)
 enclave.”

As _Common Dreams_ [reported](https://www.commondreams.org/news/israel-ai-targets)
 in April, the [Israel](https://www.commondreams.org/tag/israel)
 Defense Forces has relied on AI systems including Lavender to target people Israel believes to be Hamas members.

At _+972 Magazine_, Israeli journalist Yuval Abraham [wrote](https://www.972mag.com/lavender-ai-israeli-army-gaza/)
 that a current commander of an elite Israeli intelligence unit pushed for the use of AI to choose targets in Gaza. “The Israeli Lavender system, supported by artificial intelligence, identifies Palestinians by tracking their communications via WhatsApp or the groups they join.”

The mention of Israel’s use of WhatsApp data in Abraham’s reporting also caught the attention last month of Paul Biggar, founder of Tech for [Palestine](https://www.commondreams.org/tag/palestine)
.

“There’s a lot wrong with this—I’m in plenty of WhatsApp groups with strangers, neighbors, and in the carnage in Gaza you bet people are making groups to connect,” [wrote](https://blog.paulbiggar.com/meta-and-lavender/)
 Biggar.

_Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. The commander wrote in a guide book to create the system that “hundreds and thousands” of features can be used to select targets, “such as being in a WhatsApp group with a known militant, changing cell phone every few months, and changing addresses frequently.”

Sada Social asserted that it had found the Lavender system uses WhatsApp data to select targets.

“The reports monitored by the Sada Social Center indicate that one of the inputs to the ‘Lavender’ system relies on data collected from WhatsApp groups containing names of Palestinians or activists who are wanted by ‘Israel,'” [said](https://sada.social/post/sd-soshal-ydaao-l-thkyk-aaagl-ofory-ltsryb-myta-byanat-mstkhdmy-oatsab-l-algysh-alsrayly)
 the group in a press release. Meta has been promoting WhatsApp as a ‘private’ social network, including ‘end-to-end’ encryption of messages.”

“Providing this data as input for Lavender undermines their claim that WhatsApp is a private messaging app,” he wrote. No social network should be providing this sort of information about its users to countries engaging in ‘pre-crime.'”

Others have pointed out that Israel may have acquired WhatsApp data through means other than a leak by Meta.

Journalist Marc Owen Jones said the question of “Meta’s potential role in this is important,” but noted that informants, captured devices, and spyware could be used by Israel to gain Palestinian users’ WhatsApp data.

Bahraini activist Esra’a Al Shafei, founder of Majal.org, [told](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20240430-is-whatsapp-putting-palestinians-at-risk-of-being-killed-in-gaza/)
 the _Middle East Monitor_ that the reports that WhatsApp user data has been used by the IDF’s AI machine demonstrate why privacy advocates warn against the collection and storage of metadata, “particularly for apps like WhatsApp, which falsely advertise their product as fully private.”

“Even though WhatsApp is end-to-end encrypted, and claims to not have any backdoors to any government, the metadata alone is sufficient to expose detailed information about users, especially if the user’s phone number is attached to other Meta products and related activities,” Al Shafei said. “This is why the IDF could plausibly utilize metadata to track and locate WhatsApp users.”

While Meta and WhatsApp may not necessarily be collaborating with Israel, she said, “by the very act of collecting this information, they’re making themselves vulnerable to abuse and intrusive external surveillance.”

In turn, “by using WhatsApp, people are risking their lives,” she added.

A WhatsApp spokesperson [told](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20240430-is-whatsapp-putting-palestinians-at-risk-of-being-killed-in-gaza/)
 _Anadolu_ last month that “WhatsApp has no backdoors and we do not provide bulk information to any government,” adding that “Meta has provided consistent transparency reports and those include the limited circumstances when WhatsApp information has been requested.”

Al Shafei said Meta must “fully investigate” how WhatsApp’s metadata may be used “to track, harm, or kill its users throughout Palestine.”

“WhatsApp is used by billions of people and these users have a right to know what the dangers are in using the app,” she said, “or what WhatsApp and Meta will do to proactively protect them from such misuse.”

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated on July 31, 2024, in Tehran, Iran, in an attack attributed to Israel. The Tehran Times reported that Haniyeh used WhatsApp before his assassination. Truthout reports that Israeli intelligence allegedly uses WhatsApp data to target Palestinians.

Based on the evidence, it is plausible that Israeli intelligence tracked Ismail Haniyeh through WhatsApp. However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that Israeli intelligence used WhatsApp to track Haniyeh specifically.

Therefore, the claim is likely true, but further evidence is needed to confirm the direct use of WhatsApp for tracking Haniyeh.

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated on July 31, 2024, in Tehran, Iran, in an attack attributed to Israel. The Tehran Times reported that Haniyeh used WhatsApp before his assassination. Truthout reports that Israeli intelligence allegedly uses WhatsApp data to target Palestinians.

Based on the evidence, it is plausible that Israeli intelligence tracked Ismail Haniyeh through WhatsApp. However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that Israeli intelligence used WhatsApp to track Haniyeh specifically.

Therefore, the claim is likely true, but further evidence is needed to confirm the direct use of WhatsApp for tracking Haniyeh.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated on July 31, 2024, and that he used WhatsApp. Additionally, there are reports that Israeli intelligence uses WhatsApp data for targeting. While the claim is plausible, there is no direct confirmation that Israeli intelligence tracked Haniyeh through WhatsApp.

### Evidence from `web_search`
CUFI discusses Hamas using WhatsApp to collect intelligence on IDF movements, and the IDF countering this activity. The Tehran Times published an article stating that Ismail Haniyeh's son said his father used WhatsApp before his assassination, which the article claims was carried out by the Israeli regime on July 31, 2024. <image:1> Truthout reports that Israeli intelligence allegedly uses WhatsApp data to target Palestinians with an AI system. <image:1>

The sources are: [https://cufi.org/issue/hamas-using-whatsapp-to-collect-intelligence-on-idf-movements/](https://cufi.org/issue/hamas-using-whatsapp-to-collect-intelligence-on-idf-movements/), [https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/502689/Ismail-Haniyeh-used-WhatsApp-just-before-assassination-son-says](https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/502689/Ismail-Haniyeh-used-WhatsApp-just-before-assassination-son-says), and [https://truthout.org/articles/report-indicates-israel-uses-whatsapp-data-in-targeted-killings-of-palestinians/](https://truthout.org/articles/report-indicates-israel-uses-whatsapp-data-in-targeted-killings-of-palestinians/).


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated on July 31, 2024, in Tehran, Iran, in an attack attributed to Israel. The Tehran Times reported that Haniyeh used WhatsApp before his assassination. Truthout reports that Israeli intelligence allegedly uses WhatsApp data to target Palestinians.

Based on the evidence, it is plausible that Israeli intelligence tracked Ismail Haniyeh through WhatsApp. However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that Israeli intelligence used WhatsApp to track Haniyeh specifically.

Therefore, the claim is likely true, but further evidence is needed to confirm the direct use of WhatsApp for tracking Haniyeh.

The Assassination of Ismail Haniyeh: Silent Digital Strikes?
============================================================

Pegasus, has gained infamy worldwide for being used by governments to target various people among whom are political activists, journalists, and human right activists among others.

Enduring the otherwise conspicuous silence of his smartphone’s screen, the primitive WhatsApp message to Ismail Haniyeh was innocently insidious. It is here that the propensity of using AI for spyware is highly dangerous with situation from surveillance of people to assassination becoming more probable.

In this regards, the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh is not an exceptional case but the upcoming nature of war. It must have been similar to the NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware, which infiltrated his mobile phone to provide Israeli intelligence a look into his private conversations and real-time location.

Pegasus is a digital spirit, infamous for its stealth, tyranny, and hacking feature which transforms smart phones into spies. Magnier claimed that while Haniyeh spoke to his son not aware of the fact that the communication was being intercepted by wire tappers, Israeli agents were identifying his exact where about. The cold-blooded execution of Ismail Haniyeh evidences these methods as being highly successful, and how state actors pay careful detailing to the utilization of advanced technology that gets rid of such threats in a most efficient manner.

He said the implications of this episode are not limited to the political and military planes at the moment. In a few minutes, the information was passed through, and a specific attack was made, putting a stop to Haniyeh for good. The above attack on Haniyeh goes a long way in showing that the advanced technology qualifier, can be used in almost any operation, from counter terrorism to even suppression of political opposition. It brings about many ethical issues concerning the use of such effective surveillance equipments such as; who to blame in the case of misuse?

This is the asymmetric characteristic of today’s warfare that can be illustrated by the penetration and subsequent elimination of Haniyeh. The analysis of spyware-driven murder of Haniyeh shows that there are significant gaps which must be filled; while the fight for security should continue, it must not occur at the expense of liberty.

Regarding the broader significance of this affair, the further evolution of the technological war presents itself as a burning question."

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "For the assassination on July 31, 2024, Israeli intelligence tracked Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh through WhatsApp."

## Actions
```
web_search("Ismail Haniyeh assassination July 31 2024")
web_search("Israeli intelligence Hamas leader WhatsApp")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
According to a Wikipedia article, Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated on July 31, 2024, in Tehran, Iran, by an Israeli attack (<image:i>). The article also mentions that Israel's Defense Minister confirmed Israel's responsibility in the assassination in December 2024. The CNN article, updated August 1, 2024, reports that Haniyeh was killed in an Israeli strike in Tehran on July 31, 2024 (<image:i>).

The CNN article states that Israel has neither confirmed nor denied being behind the assassination.

### Evidence from `web_search`
CUFI discusses Hamas using WhatsApp to collect intelligence on IDF movements, and the IDF countering this activity. The Tehran Times published an article stating that Ismail Haniyeh's son said his father used WhatsApp before his assassination, which the article claims was carried out by the Israeli regime on July 31, 2024. <image:1> Truthout reports that Israeli intelligence allegedly uses WhatsApp data to target Palestinians with an AI system. <image:1>

The sources are: [https://cufi.org/issue/hamas-using-whatsapp-to-collect-intelligence-on-idf-movements/](https://cufi.org/issue/hamas-using-whatsapp-to-collect-intelligence-on-idf-movements/), [https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/502689/Ismail-Haniyeh-used-WhatsApp-just-before-assassination-son-says](https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/502689/Ismail-Haniyeh-used-WhatsApp-just-before-assassination-son-says), and [https://truthout.org/articles/report-indicates-israel-uses-whatsapp-data-in-targeted-killings-of-palestinians/](https://truthout.org/articles/report-indicates-israel-uses-whatsapp-data-in-targeted-killings-of-palestinians/).


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated on July 31, 2024, in Tehran, Iran, in an attack attributed to Israel. The Tehran Times reported that Haniyeh used WhatsApp before his assassination. Truthout reports that Israeli intelligence allegedly uses WhatsApp data to target Palestinians.

Based on the evidence, it is plausible that Israeli intelligence tracked Ismail Haniyeh through WhatsApp. However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that Israeli intelligence used WhatsApp to track Haniyeh specifically.

Therefore, the claim is likely true, but further evidence is needed to confirm the direct use of WhatsApp for tracking Haniyeh.

From [Source](https://daraj.media/en/after-the-assassinations-of-shokr-and-haniyeh-questions-arise-about-israels-precision-in-targeting-human-targets/): 
Content: "Since October 7, Israel has been promoting a new generation of armed attacks that rely on algorithmic targeting.

On the night of July 30-31, Israel targeted the Haret Hreik area in Beirut’s southern suburbs, Dahyeh, assassinating Fouad Shokr, a senior advisor to Hezbollah’s Secretary-General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, and an exclusive veterans’ facility belonging to the Revolutionary Guards in northern Tehran, where Ismail Haniyeh, the head of Hamas’s political bureau, was also assassinated.

In 1992, locating targets was far more complex due to the “miserable state of Israeli intelligence on Hezbollah,” as described by New York Times journalist Ronen Bergman in his book _Rise and Kill First: The Secret History of Israel’s Targeted Assassinations_.

Bergman details the difficulties Israeli intelligence faced in gathering information about the residence of Hezbollah’s former Secretary-General, Sayyed Abbas al-Musawi. thesis on Hezbollah, and then recruited agents to gather intelligence on al-Musawi, paving the way for his assassination.

This is not the first time Israel has employed artificial intelligence; it previously [used](https://www.democracynow.org/2024/4/5/israel_ai)
 these technologies during its war on Gaza in 2021 and in the ongoing conflict.

Israel operates what former Israeli army officers describe as a “[mass assassination factory](https://www.972mag.com/mass-assassination-factory-israel-calculated-bombing-gaza/)
,” where children in Gaza are not seen as “collateral damage.” According to these officers, every victim is killed based on algorithms and calculations known to the military.

The Israeli secret intelligence service, the Mossad, also uses artificial intelligence to carry out assassinations in Iran, exploiting the country’s entanglement in international sanctions, which hinder its ability to counter such programs.

An Iranian security source told [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2024/07/haniyeh-assassination-iran-choice/679304/)
 that “Israel used AI technology to track Ismail Haniyeh in preparation for his assassination, the same system it used in 2020 to assassinate a senior security official near Tehran.”

In October 2020, Israel assassinated Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, an Iranian Revolutionary Guard officer and nuclear scientist, with a bullet fired via satellite command. The [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/18/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-fakhrizadeh-assassination-israel.html)
 reported, citing an intelligence official familiar with the plan at the time, that “Israel chose a special model of the Belgian-made FN MAG machine gun, equipped with an advanced robotic system and multiple cameras to assassinate the nuclear scientist, and this ‘[killer robot](https://www.mc-doualiya.com/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%88%D8%B3%D8%B7/20210921-%D9%83%D9%85%D8%A7-%D9%84%D9%88-%D9%83%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AA-%D9%82%D8%B5%D8%A9-%D8%AE%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%84-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%85%D9%8A-%D9%83%D9%8A%D9%81-%D8%AA%D9%85-%D8%A7%D8%BA%D8%AA%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D9%88%D9%88%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A5%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A-%D9%85%D8%AD%D8%B3%D9%86-%D9%81%D8%AE%D8%B1%D9%8A-%D8%B2%D8%A7%D8%AF%D9%87)
,’ capable of firing 600 rounds per minute, was operated via satellite.”

Media reports [indicate](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/01/world/middleeast/how-hamas-leader-haniyeh-killed-iran-bomb.html)
 that Israel assassinated Ismail Haniyeh with a bomb hidden in his room for nearly two months.

Axios, citing sources, [reported](https://www.axios.com/2024/08/01/haniyeh-assassination-mossad)
 that the bomb was in a high-tech device using artificial intelligence, and it was detonated remotely by Mossad agents on Iranian soil.

Lebanon, due to its limited financial resources, cannot develop its technology, telecommunications, and cybersecurity capabilities, which exposes its citizens to data leaks and potentially being added to the list of AI-determined assassination targets.

Experts have [revealed](https://www.almarkazia.com/ar/news/show/530841/%D8%AA%D9%82%D9%86%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%BA%D8%AA%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%84-%D9%84%D8%A8%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%83%D9%84-%D9%87-%D9%87%D8%AF%D9%81)
 that Israel has infiltrated Lebanon’s telecommunications network and is using data such as voice recognition to identify targets.

Machines Decide Who Lives and Who Dies
--------------------------------------

Since the beginning of the October 7 attacks, Israel has revealed three target-generation systems: The Gospel for infrastructure targets, Lavender for individual human targets, and Where is Daddy?—a system designed to track and target suspected individuals when they are at home with their families.

In 2021, Yossi Sarel, the [current commander](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/05/top-israeli-spy-chief-exposes-his-true-identity-in-online-security-lapse)
 of the Israeli intelligence unit 8200, argued in his [book](https://books.google.co.il/books/about/The_Human_Machine_Team_How_to_Create_Syn.html?id=hjl1zgEACAAJ&redir_esc=y)
 for the design of a machine capable of analyzing vast amounts of data to generate thousands of military targets. While EU regulations indicate the need for designers and controllers to implement measures to protect individuals’ data, such as data encryption, questions remain about what “encryption” means and whether AI programs are designed to identify the data owners in the first place.

Even though Israel has not signed on to EU regulations, its responsibility remains, given that most of those it monitors are civilian citizens, many of whom hold foreign, including European, nationalities.

In its war on Gaza, Israel has recorded a new breach of international law and human rights, not only through the use of AI in mass killings but also by intruding into the lives of civilians in the Middle East.

Israel’s response to the Majdal Shams incident, which it claimed was orchestrated by Hezbollah, was not surprising. Israeli intelligence began by tracking Lebanese press reports, consulted a Ph.D. According to an [investigative report](https://www.972mag.com/hamas-fatah-elections-israel-arrogance/)
 cited by _The Guardian_, this machine is indeed operational under the name Lavender.

Since the October 7 attacks, Lavender has turned Israeli soldiers into mere “rubber stamps,” as they are required to spend just 20 seconds reviewing a target and confirming that it is “male and not female” before proceeding with the strike.

Unit 8200, part of Israeli intelligence, designed this system to identify individuals suspected of having ties to the military wings of Hamas and Islamic Jihad, including those with low ranks, as potential targets for airstrikes.

The program hits 90 percent of its targets and can discern whether individuals have weak ties to the targeted groups, like Hamas, or no connection at all. The system assigns almost every person in Gaza a rating from 1 to 100, reflecting the likelihood of that person being a combatant.

Lavender evaluates individuals based on a range of data, such as participation in a WhatsApp group with a known fighter, changing mobile phones every few months, photos, phone numbers, social media friendships, and frequent changes of address.

The system even adds individuals with communication patterns similar to those of Hamas or Islamic Jihad members—like police officers or civil defense personnel—to the assassination list. The [report](about:blank)
 quotes an intelligence officer saying that the Israeli army “doesn’t waste expensive bombs on unimportant people—it’s too costly for the country, and there’s a shortage of such bombs.”

The Israeli army had previously announced the use of The Gospel (Gospel), an AI technology developed by Unit 8200, in warfare. to [deliver](https://www.democracynow.org/2024/4/5/israel_ai)
 lethal strikes to jihadists as soon as they enter their homes, sending notifications to intelligence officers as soon as a person enters their residence.

Israel has access to AI programs such as [biometric surveillance, predictive policing systems](https://www.accessnow.org/publication/artificial-genocidal-intelligence-israel-gaza/)
, [GPS-based targeting technologies, biometric sensing, and behavior analysis](https://www.almarkazia.com/ar/news/show/530841/%D8%AA%D9%82%D9%86%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%BA%D8%AA%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%84-%D9%84%D8%A8%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%83%D9%84-%D9%87-%D9%87%D8%AF%D9%81)
.

According to [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/27/technology/israel-facial-recognition-gaza.html)
, Israel uses biometric surveillance, a system that employs data from the Israeli company Corsight and Google Photos to identify faces in crowds, even from low-quality drone footage.

### Evidence from `web_search`
According to a Wikipedia article, Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated on July 31, 2024, in Tehran, Iran, by an Israeli attack (<image:i>). The article also mentions that Israel's Defense Minister confirmed Israel's responsibility in the assassination in December 2024. The CNN article, updated August 1, 2024, reports that Haniyeh was killed in an Israeli strike in Tehran on July 31, 2024 (<image:i>).

The CNN article states that Israel has neither confirmed nor denied being behind the assassination.

### Evidence from `web_search`
CUFI discusses Hamas using WhatsApp to collect intelligence on IDF movements, and the IDF countering this activity. The Tehran Times published an article stating that Ismail Haniyeh's son said his father used WhatsApp before his assassination, which the article claims was carried out by the Israeli regime on July 31, 2024. <image:1> Truthout reports that Israeli intelligence allegedly uses WhatsApp data to target Palestinians with an AI system. <image:1>

The sources are: [https://cufi.org/issue/hamas-using-whatsapp-to-collect-intelligence-on-idf-movements/](https://cufi.org/issue/hamas-using-whatsapp-to-collect-intelligence-on-idf-movements/), [https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/502689/Ismail-Haniyeh-used-WhatsApp-just-before-assassination-son-says](https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/502689/Ismail-Haniyeh-used-WhatsApp-just-before-assassination-son-says), and [https://truthout.org/articles/report-indicates-israel-uses-whatsapp-data-in-targeted-killings-of-palestinians/](https://truthout.org/articles/report-indicates-israel-uses-whatsapp-data-in-targeted-killings-of-palestinians/).


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated on July 31, 2024, in Tehran, Iran, in an attack attributed to Israel. The Tehran Times reported that Haniyeh used WhatsApp before his assassination. Truthout reports that Israeli intelligence allegedly uses WhatsApp data to target Palestinians.

Based on the evidence, it is plausible that Israeli intelligence tracked Ismail Haniyeh through WhatsApp. However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that Israeli intelligence used WhatsApp to track Haniyeh specifically.

Therefore, the claim is likely true, but further evidence is needed to confirm the direct use of WhatsApp for tracking Haniyeh.

[### قصة الطفلة شام من تحت الأنقاض إلى مستشفى "برجيل" بأبو ظبي](https://www.enabbaladi.net/archives/633180)

> _**The nine-year-old Sham al-Sheikh Mohammed and her brother Omar have received wide interaction on social media since they got out after 40 hours from under the rubble in the town of Armanaz in the northern Idlib region following the massive earthquake that struck the area on February 6.**_

Sympathy for the child who sang “The Melody of Life” under the rubble was accompanied by political exploitation by the Syrian regime, whose media coverage was absent from Idlib during the first days of the earthquake and was present in the case of the child Sham, and some other cases through which it wanted to send a “political message.”

**Stuck under rubble**
----------------------

On February 7, volunteers from the Syria Civil Defense (SCD), also known as The White Helmets, rescued Sham and her brother Omar from under the rubble 40 hours after the earthquake that struck southern Turkey and four Syrian governorates. But Sham lost her mother and sister.

Sham read verses from the Holy Qur’an while she was stuck under the rubble of her house and sang the song “Ya Sham, you are our Sham” (Ash-Sham: The colloquial name of Damascus), inspiring hope in the hearts of the people and volunteers.

After her rescue, she was transferred to al-Shifaa Hospital in Idlib city.

Dr. Mohammad al-Youssef, director of the intensive care unit at al-Shifa Hospital, said in a [video recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW4ZkGozYDA)
 that the pressure of the rubble on the child’s lower limbs led to the interruption of blood flow to them, and they were threatened with amputation.

Sham and her brother suffered from crush syndrome, which posed a great threat to their lives, in conjunction with the great pressure in hospitals in northern Syria and the lack of medical equipment and supplies.

**From Idlib to Adana**
-----------------------

On February 23, ambulances transported the child Sham and her brother, accompanied by their father, to Adana Şehir Hospital in Adana state, southern Turkey, after supervision and coordination between the health ministry of the Syrian Salvation Government (SSG) operating in Idlib, and the Turkish authorities.

The child and her brother remained in the [emergency department](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1330973717761556)
 designated to receive all cases and not in the intensive care unit, with the cries of the child and her brother and demanded to return them to Idlib during their appearance in a video recording.

Their presence in the emergency department requires them to receive painkillers only and to wait until they get a turn to perform the operation at an unspecified time due to the overcrowding in the hospital, with the lack of coordination between the hospital staff and any party.

A video of the child in pain from inside the hospital received wide interaction, followed by activists on social media launching a campaign to save her, entitled “Save Sham and Omar.”

Hussein Bazar, health minister in the [Salvation Government](https://t.me/SG_M_Health/2189)
, said that the ministry is following up on the medical situation and the care provided to Sham and her brother after they entered Turkish territory to complete their treatment for crush syndrome on a permanent basis.

Upon noticing the delay in receiving the required care for their difficult condition, and after communication, “we received confirmation from high-ranking Turkish medical authorities to follow up the case directly,” Bazar added.

_The 9-year-old Sham in a hospital in Idlib after she was rescued from under the rubble in Armanaz town in Idlib countryside, following an earthquake that struck the area – February 7, 2023 (Facebook/White Helmets)_

**From Adana to Istanbul**
--------------------------

On February 25, the little girl and her brother, accompanied by their father, arrived in Istanbul on a private plane belonging to the Turkish Health Ministry to receive treatment in coordination with the [Ataa for Humanitarian Relief](https://ataarelief.org/en/)
 organization, which followed up on the case directly.

Ataa administration told _Enab Baladi_ that the role of the association was represented in sponsoring the accompanying family in terms of housing, transportation, and clothes, coordinating the transfer of Sham, her brother, and the family from Adana to Istanbul, and securing their admission to the Çam ve Sakura government hospital in the Başakşehir region.

Ataa pointed out that the Turkish government provided a private plane from the ministry of health to transport Sham and her brother from Adana to Istanbul and to host them in the Çam ve Sakura Hospital at the government’s expense, with the provision of a specialized medical staff to follow up on the case.

**From Istanbul to Abu Dhabi**
------------------------------

On February 28, the child and her brother were transferred to Burjeel Medical City in Abu Dhabi to receive treatment under the supervision of the Emirates Red Crescent and in cooperation with [Burjeel Hospital](https://www.skynewsarabia.com/business/1604241-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%B6%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D8%AD%D9%82%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%94%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%94%D8%B1%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%AD-%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%AE%D9%87%D8%A7-2022?q=%D8%A8%D8%B1%D8%AC%D9%8A%D9%84&r=1601612)
, which formed a specialized medical team for the child and her brother, and provided urgent treatment for them.

After the two children arrived at the hospital, surgeries were performed by Dr. Michael Oğlu, as the life of the child Sham was threatened as a result of gangrene that spread in the lower part of the body, and her brother Omar was also saved, according to the Emirates News Agency (WAM).

The agency said that Sham and Omar arrived under the directives of the Supreme Chairwoman of the Family Development Foundation, Honorary President of the Emirates Red Crescent (Mother of the Nation), Sheikha Fatima bint Mubarak.

Ataa Relief told _Enab Baladi_ that the child was transferred to the Emirates after its consulate contacted Sham’s father, as the Turkish authorities left the matter to her father, who agreed to transfer her and transfer the entire family to the Emirates to complete the treatment of Sham and her brother Omar in the UAE hospitals.

**Asma al-Assad exploits Sham’s condition**
-------------------------------------------

The Syrian regime’s officials and media coverage ignored mentioning Idlib governorate when talking about the areas affected by the earthquake, despite the fact that the death toll there was more than double the number of deaths in the areas under the regime’s control.

The statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs released the day after the earthquake ignored Idlib when it mentioned the affected areas, limiting itself to mentioning Aleppo, Latakia, and Hama in the statement calling for the lifting of sanctions.

On the fifth day of the earthquake, February 10, the regime mentioned Idlib for the first time during the disaster when it included it by announcing the areas affected by the earthquake (Aleppo, Hama, Latakia, and Idlib).

Nizar al-Farra, a TV host on the pro-regime Syrian Sama channel, published on February 25, quoting what he called “private sources,” that the “Syrian government” is trying through several channels, with Russian and Emirati mediation, to [persuade](https://www.facebook.com/nizar.alfarra.16/posts/pfbid0AozU4hzimZyQepTcUFSnhgXyuYWUHi8BB4mSyFEswjAfsHbW1P388vKeSYftMndAl)
 the Turkish authorities to hand over the child Sham and her brother to the Syrian health authorities to send them to the Emirates for treatment.

He stated that efforts are continuing to include the two children with six Syrian children from Aleppo and Latakia, who arrived for treatment in the UAE at the initiative of the “Syrian Presidency,” adding that the Turkish side still refuses to hand over the child or even send her directly to the UAE for treatment.

Al-Farra said, on March 1, that the child, [Sham](https://www.facebook.com/nizar.alfarra.16/posts/pfbid0oaeTUQTdyQNQXFaJEHyArKXnSV8wCKUujovauZZyT7Xu6TcGVb8VzRYYxV3HDX6nl)
, is in the UAE to be treated and that the efforts of the “Syrian State” have succeeded after “Turkey has repeatedly refused to send her and exploited her situation and health for political ends.”

Asma al-Assad, the wife of the head of the Syrian regime, appeared in a video recording published by the “Presidency of the Syrian Republic” page on Facebook, which includes a recorded call with the child Sham, which caused a wave of anger and resentment among the Syrians, who considered it “political exploitation and trading in the pain of the Syrians.”

Asma al-Assad hinted that she was aware of the child’s transfer and arrival to the Emirates, telling Sham, “You have to come back to me.”

Sham appeared in a video in one scene with her head shaved and wearing a hat in another scene, which raised suspicions that the recording was subjected to a “montage” and “editing” process.

**Family ‘doesn’t know’**
-------------------------

With the spread of the recording of Asma al-Assad’s call with Sham, local pages and activists shared audio recordings of the child’s father, who denied knowing about Asma al-Assad’s call, saying, “I was not in the hospital, and I had no knowledge of the call, and I heard about it just like you.”

The father explained that he was not satisfied from the beginning with the removal of his two children from Idlib governorate, adding, “I never had the desire to leave, but they told me that I had to travel under the pretext of securing doctors and housing for us. I will not forgive them before God; they destroyed my children.”

Activists also circulated an audio recording said to be of her brother Omar, who said that his father was not aware of the call, but people do not understand this matter.

**Children, victims of the regime**
-----------------------------------

The Syrian Network for Human Rights ([SNHR](https://snhr.org/arabic/2023/03/13/%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%86%d8%b8%d8%a7%d9%85-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b3%d9%88%d8%b1%d9%8a-%d9%82%d8%aa%d9%84-%d9%85%d8%a7-%d9%84%d8%a7-%d9%8a%d9%82%d9%84-%d8%b9%d9%86-22981-%d8%b7%d9%81%d9%84%d8%a7-%d9%81%d9%8a/)
) said on March 13 that the Syrian regime had killed no less than 22,981 children in Syria since March 2011, including 190 due to torture, and 5,199 children are still detained or forcibly disappeared.

SNHR stated that the regime assigned the task of recruiting children to the unofficial forces it formed, such as the National Defense Forces and groups and brigades of foreign and local militias, through its affiliation centers.

These forces relied on the encouragement of children and their families and provided them with many facilities. The recruitment process took on a more organized and systematic character with the formation of the National Defense Forces.

According to the monitoring group, children participated in military operations, whether as combatants or as participants in transporting ammunition, strengthening the fronts, cleaning weapons, guarding, and other missions.

**Asma Assad takes advantage of Sham’s conditions**
---------------------------------------------------

Neither regime officials nor media reports mentioned Idlib province when referring to areas affected by the quake, despite the fact that the death toll there was more than double that of regime-controlled areas.

In a statement issued the day after the earthquake, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not mention Idlib when referring to the affected area, and only mentioned Aleppo, Latakia and Khazanah in the statement calling for the lifting of sanctions. horse.

On February 10, the fifth day of the quake, the authorities mentioned Idlib for the first time when announcing the areas affected by the quake (Aleppo, Hama, Latakia and Idlib).

On February 25, Nizar al-Farra, a TV host on the pro-regime Syrian channel Sama, published an article citing what he called a “private source” that the “Syrian government” was trying to reach through multiple channels , under the mediation of Russia and the UAE, [persuade](https://www.facebook.com/nizar.alfarra.16/posts/pfbid0AozU4hzimZyQepTcUFSnhgXyuYWUHi8BB4mSyFEswjAfsHbW1P388vKeSYftMndAl)
 Turkish authorities handed over the child, Sham, and her brother to Syrian health authorities so they could be sent to the UAE for treatment.

Efforts are continuing, he said, including two children from Aleppo and Latakia and six Syrian children from Aleppo and Latakia who arrived in the UAE for treatment at the initiative of the “President of Syria”. , adding that the Turkish side still refuses to hand over the child or even send her directly to the UAE for treatment.

Al-Farra said on March 1 that the child, [Fake](https://www.facebook.com/nizar.alfarra.16/posts/pfbid0oaeTUQTdyQNQXFaJEHyArKXnSV8wCKUujovauZZyT7Xu6TcGVb8VzRYYxV3HDX6nl)
who is receiving treatment in the UAE, the efforts of the “Syrian state” were successful after “Turkey repeatedly refused to send her and exploited her situation and health for political purposes.”

The wife of the head of the Syrian regime, Asma al-Assad, appeared on Facebook’s “Presidential Palace of the Syrian Republic” page and posted a video recording, including a recording of a call with her child Sham, which sparked a wave of anger and dissatisfaction among Syrians. Think it’s a “political exploitation and painful deal for Syrians”.

Asma al-Assad implied she knew the children had been diverted and arrived in the UAE, telling Sham, “You have to come back to me.”

Shan appears in a video with her head shaved in one scene and a hat in another, making it suspicious that the recording was “montaged” and “edited”.

**Family “didn’t know”**
------------------------

As recordings of Asma Assad’s call with Sham circulated, local webpages and activists shared the recording of the father, who denied knowing Asma Assad’s phone call, saying: “I was not in the hospital at the time. , I don’t know about this call, I’ve heard of it just like you.”

The father explained that he was dissatisfied with taking his two children from Idlib province from the beginning, adding, “I never thought about leaving, but they told me I had to Getting doctors and housing as an excuse to travel for us. I will not forgive them before God; they ruined my child.”

Activists also circulated a recording said to be of her brother Omar, who said his father was unaware of the call, but people were not aware of it.

Syrian Network for Human Rights ([SNHR](https://snhr.org/arabic/2023/03/13/%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%86%d8%b8%d8%a7%d9%85-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b3%d9%88%d8%b1%d9%8a-%d9%82%d8%aa%d9%84-%d9%85%d8%a7-%d9%84%d8%a7-%d9%8a%d9%82%d9%84-%d8%b9%d9%86-22981-%d8%b7%d9%81%d9%84%d8%a7-%d9%81%d9%8a/)
) said on March 13 that since March 2011, the Syrian regime has killed at least 22,981 children in Syria, of which 190 were killed as a result of torture, and another 5,199 children are still detained or forcibly disappeared.

SNHR said the regime, through its affiliated centers, assigned the task of recruiting children to unofficial forces it formed, such as groups and brigades of the National Defense Forces and foreign and local militias.

These forces rely on the encouragement of the children and their families and provide them with many facilities. With the creation of the Wehrmacht, the recruitment process was more organized and systematic.

The Monitoring Group understands that children are involved in military operations, both as combatants and in tasks such as delivering ammunition, fortifying front lines, cleaning weapons, and guarding.

Tyrants learn from each other, share information, and observe the tactics of repression used by the world’s dictators and autocrats to reproduce in their own countries. Arbitrary arrests of dissidents, torture in prisons, attacks on activists’ family members, or the use of artificial intelligence to control the population are repeated almost systematically in most authoritarian regimes. “From Egypt and Iran to Russia and Venezuela, dictators copy and cooperate with each other,” warns Iranian journalist and dissident Masih Alinejad. Her denunciation coincides with the account of the dozens of defenders of human rights gathered last June at the [Oslo Freedom Forum](https://oslofreedomforum.com/norway-2023/)
, the activist convention organized every year by the [Human Rights Foundation (HRF).](https://hrf.org/)
 Their testimonies make up what could be considered a guide to the actions of modern dictators and autocrats, a set of traditional forms of repression reinforced by the options offered by new technology and the constant concern over their public image.

### Arbitrary arrests

The arbitrary detention of activists, journalists, or opponents without legitimate reasons or without due process is “a fundamental weapon of autocratic regimes,” says Félix Maradiaga. He is one of the 200 Nicaraguan political prisoners whom [Daniel Ortega’s regime banished to the United States last February](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-02-09/nicaragua-frees-over-200-political-prisoners-puts-them-on-plane-to-us.html)
 after depriving them of their nationality. “They know that by arresting dissidents they divert attention from political movements, which are forced to pause for a while and stop talking about reforms in education and health or addressing issues such as corruption,” he continues. His own experience is proof: after announcing his pre-candidacy for the presidency of the country in 2021, he was arrested on charges of “treason” and spent “611 agonizing days in one of the most atrocious maximum-security prisons in Latin America.”

The aim of these arrests, according to Venezuelan journalist Victor Navarro, is to spread terror. “Autocratic regimes feed on fear and are strengthened by silence,” he summarizes. He too was detained “arbitrarily.” “I worked in social reintegration, but in Venezuela offering opportunities can be considered a crime,” says the activist, who was accused of “treason” and “terrorism.” “About 35 police officers broke down the door of my house,” he recalls. He was locked up for five months.

Uighur Gulbahar Haitiwaji, on the other hand, had “never been involved” in political or social activities. But Xi Jinping’s regime found her guilty of “disloyalty to the Chinese government,” as part of [Beijing’s crackdown on members of the Muslim minority](https://english.elpais.com/international/2022-05-24/secret-police-files-put-a-face-to-chinas-repression-in-xinjiang-child-prisoners-and-shoot-to-kill-orders.html)
 — some 11.6 million people — in the Xinjiang autonomous region. “I lived in France with my husband and daughters and, following a call from my former employer, I planned a two-week return trip \[to Xinjiang\]... I had no idea what was waiting for me there,” recalls the woman, who spent three years in so-called “re-education centers,” internment camps where Beijing exercises its crackdown on Uighurs.

### Torture

[Beatings, rape and inhuman and degrading treatment](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-03-26/the-rampant-abuse-in-el-salvadors-prisons-they-beat-him-to-death-in-the-cell-and-dragged-him-out-like-an-animal.html)
 are a constant in the testimony of those who have been arrested for political reasons. “In prison I suffered things that I am not yet prepared to talk about in public,” says Nicaraguan Maradiaga.

[Torture](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-05-29/inmates-in-el-salvador-tortured-and-strangled-a-report-denounces-hellish-conditions-in-bukeles-prisons.html)
 is first and foremost an attempt at “dehumanization,” Navarro says. “I was number 25510806,” the code he was assigned after entering Venezuela’s Helicoide prison. The aggressions, he reveals, were continuous. “They wouldn’t let me sleep; I heard another prisoner being suffocated, the sound of rape...,” recalls the activist, who says he went 129 days without seeing sunlight.

A red bracelet on Haitiwaji’s ankle reminds her that she survived torture in Xinjiang detention centers. The officers squeezed her shackles so tightly that they made her bleed. And in the midst of the pain, she says she whispered: “My poor ankle, you have suffered so much for me, if I ever manage to leave this place I promise that I will adorn you with a beautiful chain.” It was one of the many times the woman was interrogated in one of the so-called “tiger chairs”: “They put a black hood on us, handcuffed our hands and ankles.” But those were not the only times she was tortured: “I was chained to a bed for 20 days and the humiliation I felt was unbearable. I struggled for 10 days not to relieve myself in front of them. In the end, with a very strong pain in my stomach, I relieved myself in tears.”

The one who cannot recount the torture he suffered is Alaa Abd El-Fattah. This blogger and intellectual symbol of the Egyptian opposition has been imprisoned for almost four years after being convicted in an express trial for allegedly spreading false information on social networks. But one of his sisters, Sanaa Seif, speaks on his behalf and says that the situation is so terrible that her brother had even thought about suicide: “He said that his life was unbearable, because the worst thing was not torture, but that they deprived him of everything that gave meaning to his life, such as sunlight, music, and books... He said he lived like an animal.”

### Attacks on family members

In their strategy of spreading terror, dictators and autocrats strive to show that a dissident’s activism puts their family at risk. This is what happened to Haitiwaji. “They questioned me about my life in France, they showed me a photograph of my daughter covering herself with an East Turkestan flag \[symbol of the Uighur independence movement\] during a protest,” recalls the woman, who ended up signing a confession in which she declared that she had “gathered people to disturb the social order.”

Sanaa Seif did end up in prison three times for demanding her brother’s freedom. Aware of the pain that the detention of a loved one inflicts on families, she recounts how she combed her hair and put on makeup to try to look her best during the 20-minute visit with her mother or sister that the authorities allowed her once a month.

Beyond the arrest itself, the [psychological damage caused to families by the detention of a family member is very profound](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-06-11/mothers-by-force-the-silent-impact-of-president-bukeles-state-of-exception-in-el-salvador.html)
. “When they arrested me, my mom was told to look for me at the morgue,” Navarro laments. Sharing a similar anguish is Evgenia Kara-Murza, wife of Russian journalist and President Putin’s political opponent Vladimir Kara-Murza, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison for high treason because “his voice was a danger to Putin’s regime.” “The pain of having someone you love in prison is immense,” she says.

### Kleptocrat practices

“It happens in Sudan, in Yemen, in Russia, in China, in Iran... They are kleptocrat regimes,” says Casey Michel, HRF’s program director against systems of governance that prioritize the enrichment of the rich at the expense of the public interest. [Kleptocracy](https://english.elpais.com/elpais/2018/06/11/the_global_observer/1528717970_008019.html)
 is, according to Casey, one of the hallmarks of authoritarian systems, but warns that it is “a transnational phenomenon.” “Autocracies and dictatorships use the financial secrecy of places like Delaware \[United States\] to take money out of their country, whether it’s Equatorial Guinea or Angola, and enjoy it wherever they want,” he complains.

This is well known to activist Ketakandriana Rafitoson, the only judge in Madagascar who has resigned due to interference in justice, has spent her entire life dedicated to the fight against corruption. “This is the source of extreme poverty in my country,” she stresses, a state in which 75% of the population lives on less than $2 a day. “Successive leaders chose corruption as a way to govern the country,” she laments. And, as an example, she gives a figure that she considers unaffordable: “In 2013, one of the candidates for the presidential elections spent $43 million (€38.3 million) on a single campaign, in a country where people go hungry.” “If 36 candidates participated in the 2018 elections, how much money was wasted?” she asks.

> “It is a mistake to believe that there are different dictatorships, right and left, socialist and capitalist, when the reality is that it is a question of good and evil.”
> 
> Thor Halvorssen, founder of the Human Rights Foundation

The big mistake, according to Thor Halvorssen, founder of HRF, is “to believe that there are different dictatorships, right and left, socialist and capitalist, when the reality is that it is a question of good and evil,” he states. This classification, “whose objective is to divide people,” leads one to think, according to Halvorssen, that [Venezuela](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-06-14/venezuelas-economic-crisis-has-led-to-a-surge-in-suicides.html)
’s regime is, for example, socialist. “But it’s not, because everyone in power is a millionaire or a billionaire,” he says.

### The care of the international image

Asma al-Assad, the wife of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, held a video call last March with Sham Sheikh Mohammed, a nine-year-old Syrian girl who survived the earthquakes that struck Turkey and Syria on February 6, while she was receiving treatment in a hospital in Abu Dhabi. “She was trapped for more than 40 hours,” says Syrian activist Abdulrahman Almawwas, co-founder of the White Helmets, the Syrian volunteer organization specializing in rescues. The hurtful thing about that call is that the girl Assad phoned lived “in northern Syria[, an area that has been attacked and bombed by Damascus for the](https://elpais.com/internacional/2023-02-12/la-siria-rebelde-la-gran-olvidada-del-terremoto.html)
 last 10 years,” explains Almawwas, who also criticizes how dictators try to “clean up their crimes before international public opinion.”

But the most recent illustrative example of how authoritarian regimes try to whitewash their image is, for Sanaa Seif, the celebration of the United Nations Climate Summit in the Egyptian town of Sharm el Sheikh in November of last year. “Abdel Fattah al-Sisi’s regime didn’t want the stories of political prisoners to spread, so I took the risk of flying there,” she said. Her brother was on hunger strike at the time to demand improvements in his detention conditions. “Climate activists from all over the world chanted the name of Alaa and \[British Prime Minister\] Rishi Sunak, \[German Chancellor\] Olaf Scholz and \[French President\] Emmanuel Macron called for his release,” she recalls. Her brother’s prison conditions suddenly improved.

### The use of new technology

Rwandan activist Carine Kanimba’s mobile phone was infected with [Pegasus spy software](https://english.elpais.com/international/2022-05-03/pegasus-europes-deepening-spyware-scandal.html)
. The young woman, daughter of Rwandan opponent Paul Rusesabagina, the famous former manager of the Hotel Mille Collines — which Hollywood immortalized in the film _Hotel Rwanda_ — has been protesting since 2020 that her father was kidnapped from his home in San Antonio (Texas) and taken to Rwanda, where he was convicted of terrorism and sentenced to 25 years in prison. Resesabagina, an opponent of President Paul Kagame, “would never have traveled” to the African country, says his daughter, who with the help of several organizations says she discovered that the Rwandan government had been “tracking the whole family.”

“All dictatorships do the same things, although they seem to be very different; for example, now they have started using artificial intelligence and facial recognition cameras,” explains Serbian activist Srdja Popovic, promoter of the student mobilizations that precipitated the fall of former Serbian dictator Slobodan Misolevic, and current director of the Center for the Application of Nonviolent Actions and Strategies (CANVAS). So it was for Haitiwaji. “When they arrested me, they took blood samples, scanned my face and irises and recorded a sample of my voice,” she says.

And dictators share these systems, warns Nathan Law, one of the leaders of Hong Kong’s so-called umbrella revolution. “China has taken advantage of the preoccupation of the narrative that prioritizes security over freedom and sells technology that serves to identify people,” warns the young man, currently exiled in London. This software_,_ remember, has only one purpose: to suppress protests and ensure the survival of the regime.

Syria, Russia Accuse US of Lying About Chemical Weapons Attacks

Print

STATE DEPARTMENT — 

Syria and Russia on Wednesday accused the United States of lying about chemical weapons attacks in the Syrian conflict as a way of derailing efforts to bring an end to the fighting.

Syria's state-run SANA news agency carried comments from a Foreign Ministry source condemning what it called "lies and allegations" by U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian.

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told the Interfax news agency that whenever peace efforts advance, the United States promotes "rigged, unverified reports" of chemical weapons attacks in Syria.

Those comments came a day after the United States joined its NATO allies in launching a pressure campaign against the use of chemical weapons in Syria, while singling out Russia for protecting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government.

"The recent attacks in East Ghouta raise serious concerns that Bashar al-Assad’s Syrian regime might be continuing its use of chemical weapons against its own people," Tillerson said at a Paris conference hosted by Le Drian.

Tillerson said at least 20 people were killed Monday in an apparent chlorine gas attack in rebel-held East Ghouta, near Damascus.  
  
"Whoever conducted the attacks, Russia ultimately bears responsibility for the victims in East Ghouta and countless other Syrians targeted with chemical weapons since Russia became involved in Syria," he said.

A Syrian boy holds an oxygen mask over the face of an infant at a makeshift hospital following a reported gas attack on the rebel-held besieged town of Douma in the eastern Ghouta region on the outskirts of the capital Damascus, Jan. 22, 2018.

Tillerson, along with foreign ministers from France, Germany and Turkey, were among those who launched the International Partnership Against Impunity for Use of Chemical Weapons on Tuesday. More than two dozen like-minded nations endorsed a political commitment to share information on combating the use of chemical weapons worldwide.

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson delivers a speech during a foreign ministers' meeting on the International Partnership against Impunity for the Use of Chemical Weapons, in Paris, Jan. 23, 2018.

The U.S. secretary of state noted Russia's failure to resolve the chemical weapons issue in Syria calls into question its commitment to the resolution of the overall crisis.

"At a very minimum, Russia must stop vetoing and at least abstain from future security council votes on this issue," Tillerson said.

In November, Russia vetoed the renewal of an independent and technical group created by the U.N. Security Council, the so-called Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM), to look into the perpetrators of chemical weapons attacks in Syria.  
  
"When Russia killed the JIM, they sent a dangerous message to the world — one that not only said chemical weapons use is acceptable but also that those who use chemical weapons don’t need to be identified or held accountable," U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said in a statement Tuesday.

Turkey's offensive in the northern Syrian enclave of Afrin was also a focus of Tuesday's talks in Paris, with Tillerson meeting with his Turkish counterpart, Mevlut Cavusoglu. A day earlier, during remarks in London, the top U.S. diplomat said the United States is "concerned" about the offensive against U.S.-backed Kurdish YPG fighters in Syria.

Turkish forces intensified military operations on Monday to push the Kurdish militia out of the Afrin area.

The Turkish operation is aimed at ousting from Afrin the Syrian Kurdish group that has controlled territory in northern Syria and proven effective in the U.S.-coalition-led fight against Islamic State militants.

Turkey considers the YPG to be a terrorist organization associated with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party or PKK, which has fought for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey.

French Foreign Minister Le Drian on Tuesday joined Tillerson in expressing his concern about Turkey’s military operation in Afrin.

"I had the opportunity to tell my Turkish colleague that this offensive worries us," Le Drian said.

"While we understand the concerns Turkey has about border security, we cannot but call on Turkey to show the greatest level restraint on this issue," the French foreign minister added.

Turkey's shelling into Afrin came after the U.S.-led coalition said it would form a 30,000-strong Kurdish-led border security force in northern Syria.

Washington later said the effort had been mischaracterized and that the United States was not creating a border force, but that the coalition would provide security to liberated areas, blocking escape routes for Islamic State militants.

#### **The Issue**

*   _The international community’s failure to deter or punish Syrian president Bashar al-Assad’s use of chemical weapons risks incentivizing the use of chemical weapons by others._
    *   _Assad’s use of chemical weapons has highlighted their military effectiveness and undermined the norms prohibiting their use._
*   _Increasing multipolarity has made international accountability more challenging._
*   _Actors are likely to challenge existing norms by gradually escalating their chemical weapons use from riot-control agents to toxic industrial chemicals or pharmaceutical-based agents while spreading disinformation and impeding evidence collection._
*   _The United States should strengthen detection and accountability mechanisms to deter future chemical weapons usage._
    *   _It should work with allies and partners to prioritize the early detection and prevention of chemical weapons development, develop backchannels to establish deterrence, and define clear red lines against chemical weapons usage._

#### **Introduction**

On August 21, 2013, Syrian president Bashar al-Assad’s army killed an estimated 1,400 people in Eastern Ghouta with sarin gas. It was the first use of chemical weapons in the Middle East in 25 years, but not the last. As he battled a dogged insurgency, Assad used sarin in another mass casualty event; he has used chlorine gas nearly 350 times.\[1\]

Following the 2013 Ghouta attack, international outrage prompted efforts to eliminate Syria’s chemical arsenal with Russia’s cooperation. Yet, accountability for war crimes has faded from the international spotlight, as has Russian cooperation to investigate and attribute chemical weapons attacks in Syria. Assad won back most of his territory and has reentered the Arab League. He transgressed international norms and survived. Assad’s success may push adversaries and allies of the United States alike to consider using chemical weapons as he did.

> Assad’s success may push adversaries and allies of the United States alike to consider using chemical weapons as he did.

If such a thing happened, it would have a precedent. During the Cold War, four Arab states embarked on chemical weapons programs, with Egypt taking a pioneering role in both development and usage in the 1960s. The Egyptian military used chemical weapons on Yemeni royalists sheltering in caves in Yemen as early as June 1963, and it eventually launched around 40 separate chemical weapons attacks in the country.\[2\] Libya, Syria, and Iraq subsequently began chemical weapons programs, Iraq with Egyptian assistance. Saddam Hussein’s regime would eventually use such weapons extensively in the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s.\[3\] Muammar Gaddafi decided to pursue a similar capability in the 1970s and eventually used the chemical weapons developed in Chad. Syria also began developing chemical weapons in the 1970s, and with Egypt’s and, later, North Korea’s help, grew one of the most advanced chemical weapons arsenals in the world.\[4\]

The environment radically changed after the Cold War ended. The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) prohibiting the development and use of these weapons became nearly universal, with 193 State Parties in 1997 (although Syria, Egypt, and Israel did not ratify the CWC due to persistent regional tensions and unresolved arms control concerns). Still, chemical weapons use halted in the region for 25 years—until it reemerged in Syria under Assad. With the Syrian regime’s use of chemical weapons and rising global competition breaking the consensus around shared norms like the CWC, the circumstances may once again be ripe for renewed chemical weapons proliferation and usage in the Middle East and beyond.

To evaluate this prospect, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) Middle East Program undertook an investigation to assess the potential return of chemical weapons threats to the Middle East and what the United States could do about it. The project was supported by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), but the findings should in no way be interpreted to reflect the views of DTRA, the U.S. Department of Defense, or the U.S. government.

#### **Methodology**

The project’s methodology is based on desk research, 43 interviews, and a tabletop exercise (TTX). CSIS interviewed current and former U.S. and allied government officials, Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and International Criminal Court (ICC) officials, chemical weapons and arms control experts, prosecutors and investigators, survivors, and Syrian regime defectors. The interviews and the TTX assessed the potential for a second wave of chemical weapons proliferation in the Middle East and identified ways that the United States could curb the threat.

The TTX evaluated potential chemical weapons users’ calculations when deciding whether and what kind of chemical weapons to use and the U.S. government’s response to chemical weapons usage in another country. The 23 participants in the TTX included current and former U.S. State Department, Defense Department, National Security Council, military, and OPCW officials, as well as chemical weapons and country experts. The CSIS-created scenarios centered on Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, Egyptian president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, and Iranian supreme leader Ali Khamenei as potential chemical weapons users when faced with a significant challenge to their respective regimes. These governments were chosen to reflect states with different alliances, political systems, and histories with chemical weapons, including as developers, proliferators, users, and victims. In the second part of the TTX, teams predicted what a U.S. response to chemical weapons attacks might be and how it could be improved.

#### **Analysis**

CSIS analysis revealed several alarming trends. First, most experts believe that the taboo against chemical weapons use in the Middle East is in danger and has probably already eroded. Interviews and the TTX both reinforced this point. Experts underscored the utility of these weapons’ psychological impacts, instilling terror even when used without great precision. The sobering reality is that weaponized toxic industrial chemicals (TICs) such as chlorine can have many of the same impacts as agents the CWC specifically bars, such as sarin. Consequently, virtually any actor can wield chemical weapons with chilling effectiveness.

CSIS also found that U.S. allies and adversaries are likely learning from Syria’s use of chemical weapons. The Syrian government’s use of Schedule 1 agents such as sarin provoked swift international condemnation, but it used TICs such as chlorine repeatedly with relative impunity. Syria’s experience, combined with ambiguity in the CWC regarding TICs, riot-control agents (RCAs), and pharmaceutical-based agents (PBAs), could tempt some states to escalate attacks with these substances gradually, testing the limits of international accountability.

In addition, approaches can be blended. Assad demonstrated a successful strategy for using Schedule 1 agents sparingly for internal and external deterrence, interspersed with chlorine gas attacks for more tactical military operations. U.S. adversaries may believe that they could survive economic sanctions and other forms of international condemnation just as the Syrian regime did. Experts with whom CSIS consulted assessed that U.S. partners are likely to believe they could use their political leverage for protection against international retribution.

This latter issue points to a larger concern. A more multipolar world makes deterrence and accountability more challenging, if not impossible. With increased great power competition, the experts that CSIS consulted concluded that it will become easier for chemical weapons users to find an international patron that can protect them from accountability. The TTX and expert interviews underscored other tactics that potential users might employ to evade accountability, such as deflecting blame or disseminating disinformation. The support of powerful allies like Russia and China on the world stage would make such strategies more effective.

> A more multipolar world makes deterrence and accountability more challenging, if not impossible.

Finally, despite the ease of using TICs as weapons, experts assessed that nonstate actors appear to be a lesser threat to the chemical weapons taboo than state actors. Though governments may blame nonstate actors in “false flag” attacks, nonstate actors’ lack of technical expertise and the widescale availability of conventional weapons limit the likelihood of their usage of chemical weapons. The United States and others may also find it easier and more politically palatable to punish nonstate actors.

Experts noted that the United States could work with its allies, the OPCW, and other international bodies, including the UN General Assembly (UNGA) and the UN Secretary-General’s Mechanism for Investigation of Alleged Use of Chemical and Biological Weapons (UNSGM), to reestablish consensus on the chemical weapons taboo and pursue alternative pathways toward accountability (e.g., courts with international jurisdiction, including the ICC). Given U.S. reluctance to use military means to punish chemical weapons users, the TTX and expert interviews highlighted that prevention was key to discouraging chemical weapons use. The United States should enhance intelligence efforts to detect chemical weapons activity. Then, it should discuss alternatives with allies and backchannel robust threats and incentives to deter adversaries from using chemical weapons and inciting a mass casualty event.

**Findings and Recommendations**

**1) Finding:** The taboo against chemical weapons use has been degraded since Syria began using chemical weapons in 2013. As a result, Middle Eastern governments, including U.S. partners and allies, may be willing to use chemical weapons if there is a significant challenge to their regimes.

> Middle Eastern governments, including U.S. partners and allies, may be willing to use chemical weapons if there is a significant challenge to their regimes.

_**1a) Recommendation:**_ The U.S. Department of Defense and the White House, in coordination with high-ranking officials in the Middle East, should further develop a regional security architecture or regional fora similar to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to improve lines of communication and reduce the potential for misunderstanding, surprises, and unplanned escalation. This could allow the United States to prevent some actors, especially partners, from using chemical weapons.

_**1b) Recommendation:**_ The United States should use backchannels to communicate significant threats for using chemical weapons and, potentially, incentives for not using them (e.g., the United States offering to help the Egyptian military quell an insurgency using conventional means). To preempt chemical weapons attacks in this way, the United States will need to develop deeper intelligence capabilities on chemical weapons stockpiles. In Syria, having this capability prior to a major attack gave Washington a window to change Assad’s calculus.

**2) Finding:** Mediating powers and middle powers may be essential in channeling communications during a potential escalation, making incentives and warnings more effective. For example, both Syria and Egypt’s main concern in the near term is the loss of Gulf support. If the United States can win the support of Gulf states to uphold the norm, threats will be more effective.

_**2a) Recommendation:**_ U.S. diplomats and military officials should work with these mediating powers to reestablish red lines on arms control and chemical weapons usage and to deliver messages to potential chemical weapons users during times of increased threat. They could relay the message that there is widespread consensus on the need to pursue accountability if chemical weapons are used.

_**2b) Recommendation:**_ In return for existing defense and diplomatic ties, U.S. diplomats should encourage these states to act as linkages and mediators to deescalate tensions when a neighbor is facing significant challenges.

**3) Finding:** States could likely act with impunity if they eased into chemical weapons use. Learning from the Syria example, actors could test the limits of international outrage and condemnation and gradually raise the threshold of objectionable behavior. For example, they could start using RCAs in lethal ways, and then graduate to using TICs or PBAs. These chemicals, in combination with sporadic usage of Schedule 1 and 2 chemicals, could inspire fear among opposition forces or in communities while limiting an international response due to the ambiguity on their usage in the CWC.

_**3a) Recommendation:**_ U.S. diplomats should work with allies to condemn the Syrian government’s regularized use of chlorine gas and bar further normalization with the Syrian regime. U.S. diplomats in the United Nations should work with other states in UNGA to develop a consensus around prohibited uses for RCAs, TICs, and PBAs.

_**3b) Recommendation:**_ U.S. diplomats in The Hague should work with other member states, the OPCW, and private companies, in tandem with experts at the Chemical and Biological Controls Division, the Office of Chemical and Biological Weapons Affairs, DTRA, and the Australia Group to better regulate the movement, storage, and usage of dual-use chemicals, TICs, RCAs, and PBAs.

**4) Finding:** Chemical weapons users are likely to spread disinformation and impede the collection of evidence to evade accountability. This limits the effectiveness of investigations and encourages usage, gradually deteriorating the CWC.

_**4a) Recommendation:**_ The Department of Defense—including DTRA—should support the development of evidence collection technologies such as “drone sniffers” and lab materials that would make it easier to collect evidence and train trusted organizations or civil society members to gather evidence when needed.

_**4b) Recommendation**_**:** The U.S. State Department’s CBW and DTRA’s Information Resiliency Office should work together to strengthen the credibility of the OPCW, local evidence collectors, and chemical weapons experts. These efforts should focus not only on the gathering of evidence, but also on incorporating the help of communications experts. The U.S. government should also continue to support the OPCW ChemTech Centre.

_**4c) Recommendation:**_ The Department of Defense should continue to seek support for, and even strengthen, DTRA’s Information Resiliency Office to protect the agency from disinformation. These efforts should be expanded to interagency efforts with the State Department and the UN mission to prevent the effectiveness of disinformation directed at other relevant U.S. government entities.

**5) Finding:** Chemical weapons do not stand alone. They are integrated into a broader warfighting toolkit. Governments use chemical weapons in conjunction with other military tactics, such as conventional explosive weapons and sieges, to amplify fear among armed adversaries and civilians alike. U.S. officials may underestimate the motivations for using chemical weapons because they judge the “success” of chemical weapons through direct casualty numbers rather than their broader military—and psychological—effects.

_**5a) Recommendation:**_ DTRA should analyze the secondary effects of chemical weapons usage by collecting evidence and testimony on their usage when used alongside conventional weapons to assess their tactical benefits beyond direct casualty figures. With such information, the United States may better predict why an actor would use them, prevent proliferation and attacks, and strengthen accountability for these secondary uses.

**6) Finding:** Nonstate actors appear to be a lesser threat to the chemical weapons taboo than state actors.

_**6a) Recommendation:**_ Scholars should conduct further research to determine if new delivery mechanisms and the accessibility of certain types of TICs could increase the threat of nonstate actors using chemical weapons.

**7) Finding:** Escalating tensions between the United States and Russia, coupled with fractures in the international community, challenge existing mechanisms for chemical weapons control and accountability.

_**7a) Recommendation:**_ To reverse the normalization of chemical weapons usage and the breakdown of other norms, U.S. diplomats should launch a preemptive and aggressive multilateral campaign to hold chemical weapons users to account. For this multilateral approach to be effective, the United States needs to work more closely with members of the Global South and with China to ensure that such measures (e.g., investigations, sanctions, asset freezes, travel bans, etc.) are effective.

> To reverse the normalization of chemical weapons usage and the breakdown of other norms, U.S. diplomats should launch a preemptive and aggressive multilateral campaign to hold chemical weapons users to account.

_**7b) Recommendation:**_ To widen support of the CWC and accountability efforts, DTRA should assess the strategic reasons that actors—including adversaries such as China and allies and partners such as Egypt or India—would want to prevent the proliferation and usage of chemical weapons.

_**7c) Recommendation:**_ The United States and its allies and partners should consider supporting an entity separate from the OPCW and UNSC that would attribute violations and hold violators criminally liable. They should ensure that any such entity embraces a diverse membership. The Working Group to Advance Proposals for International Criminal Accountability for Chemical Weapons Use established in September 2024 and composed of 12 states from around the world is one step toward such an effort.

_**7d) Recommendation:**_ The Department of Justice, the United States Ambassador-at-Large for Global Criminal Justice, and diplomats with the OPCW and partners should enhance measures within and outside of the OPCW that would strengthen CWC prohibitions and ensure that those responsible for crimes involving chemical weapons will be brought to justice. For example, INTERPOL Washington, the U.S. National Central Bureau, should support specialized training projects for law enforcement officers, prosecutors, and judges. The United States and allies should also further develop the capacity of the OPCW’s Investigation and Identification Team to interface with national and international legal systems to prosecute those that have used chemical weapons.

_**7e) Recommendation:**_ U.S. diplomats at the UN mission and partners should explore avenues for coalition-building around accountability and investigations within the United Nations. The United States should build coalitions with nonpermanent UNSC members and UNGA to enhance and broaden support for accountability for noncompliance with the CWC. The UNGA-created International, Impartial, and Independent Mechanism (IIIM) to assist in the investigation and prosecution of persons responsible for the most serious crimes committed since March 2011 is a good example of how effective such efforts can be. The IIIM helps to preserve evidence that states with universal jurisdiction could use for prosecution. The United States should also work to strengthen the UN Secretary-General’s Mechanism for Investigation of Alleged Use of Chemical and Biological Weapons (UNSGM) to investigate chemical weapons uses when CWC procedures do not apply or are not invoked by any State Party.

_**7f) Recommendation:**_ U.S. diplomats should consider focusing on the elimination of chemical weapons in the Middle East as the first step in a broader effort to uphold the Conference on the Establishment of a Middle East Zone Free of Nuclear Weapons and Other Weapons of Mass Destruction.

Content: "Tillerson: Russia 'ultimately bears responsibility' for chemical attacks in Syria
=================================================================================

The strong statement comes as the U.S. tries to rally the global community.

ByABC News

January 23, 2018, 2:24 PM

&#151; -- In the aftermath of another "apparent chlorine gas attack" by the regime of Syrian [President Bashar al-Assad](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/president-bashar-al-assad.htm)
, Secretary of State [Rex Tillerson](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/business/CEOs/rex-tillerson.htm)
 blasted the Assad regime for its "crimes against humanity" but also laid some of the blame on Russia.

"Whoever conducted the attacks, Russia ultimately bears responsibility for the victims in east Ghouta and countless other Syrians targeted with [chemical weapons](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/syrian-chemical-weapons.htm)
 since Russia became involved in [Syria](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/syrian-protests.htm)
," Tillerson said in Paris at the launch of a new international group to pressure Assad and Russia.

The strong statement comes as the U.S. tries to rally the international community and assert a leadership role in Syria after seven years of war and in the face of an increasingly strong Assad regime.

As ABC News reported Monday, Tillerson highlighted the latest reported chemical weapons attack that affected more than 20 civilians -- most of them children, he said. The attack hit east Ghouta, an enclave of rebel support in the Damascus suburbs, a part of the country that Assad has long dominated. East Ghouta has been under siege by the regime for years now, but despite a cease-fire agreement over the summer, the regime has starved and bombed the area for the past few months. In recent weeks, that bombing campaign escalated, according to monitoring groups.

"The recent attacks in east Ghouta are a serious concern that Bashar al-Assad's Syrian regime may be continuing its use of chemical weapons against its own people," Tillerson said. "Since April 2014, there has been mounting evidence that Syria continues to illicit possess chemical weapons and use them against its own people."

But it was Russia that Tillerson took to task, challenging the role the country plays by providing support and troops to Assad -- who, after initial defeats, now controls half of the country's population and territory.

"Russia's failure to resolve the chemical weapons issue in Syria calls into question its relevance to the resolution to the overall crisis," Tillerson said.

In particular, Tillerson said Russia had failed to live up to its commitments under the 2013 deal with the Obama administration to eliminate all of Syria's chemical weapons and other international legal obligations: "There is simply no denying that Russia, by shielding its Syrian ally, has breached its commitments to the United States as a framework guarantor. It has betrayed the Chemical Weapons Convention and U.N. [Security Council](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/us/security-council.htm)
 Resolution 2218," he said.

Russia has intervened in Syria on Assad's behalf since 2015, but in August 2013 it helped broker an agreement with President Barack Obama to remove Syria's chemical weapons stockpile. That agreement came on the heels of Obama contemplating airstrikes on Syrian targets after the regime killed at least 1,400 people, including 426 children, in a chemical weapons attack, also in the Damascus suburbs, according to a U.S. government report at the time. Ultimately, Obama punted to Congress, and the U.S. never took any action.

The Trump administration challenged Syria's use of chemical weapons once before -- with a series of airstrikes last April on a Syrian air base after the regime killed dozens in a town called Khan Shaykhun.

U.S. ambassador to the [United Nations](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/united-nations.htm)
 [Nikki Haley](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/us/nikki-haley.htm)
 joined Tillerson in his condemnation of Russia, releasing a paper statement that said, "This attack in Syria should weigh heavily" on Russia's "conscience."

The U.S. "will pursue all available avenues for accountability," according to Haley's office, including through the U.N. Security Council, the [Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/chemical-weapons-convention.htm)
 and the International Partnership Against Impunity for the Use of Chemical Weapons -- the new international group Tillerson helped launch today. The 29-nation organization will collect, share and publicize information about chemical attack perpetrators, including details about sanctions.

For his part, Tillerson called on Russia to "at a bare minimum ... stop vetoing and at least abstain from future Security Council votes on this issue."

Russia has twice vetoed resolutions for an investigative body to examine who is responsible for chemical weapons attacks in Syria, and the Security Council was set to meet again on Syria on Tuesday afternoon.

"This initiative puts those who ordered and carried out chemical weapons attacks on notice. You will face a day of reckoning for your crimes against humanity and your victims will see justice done," Tillerson said in conclusion. "The people of east Ghouta are watching, and the rest of the world is watching as well."

But in a major policy address on Syria last week, Tillerson sounded a more optimistic tone on Russia and the "meaningful role" it plays in Syria -- and even praised Russia for its cooperation with the U.S. and [Jordan](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/jordan-jordanian.htm)
 on one de-escalation zone south of Damascus, despite ongoing Assad offensives elsewhere.

"That's why we're disappointed with the foreign minister's comments," Under Secretary of State Steve Goldstein told ABC News Monday, a reference to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accusing the U.S. of fomenting unrest and instability in Syria and even supporting al Qaeda-linked militants. "The secretary is very unhappy that Russia has not stepped up to the plate as we would expect them to."

Still, with offensives against the last rebel stronghold, Idlib province, and the relentless bombing of east Ghouta, Assad and his allies, including Russia and Iran, seem to be marching onward, again and again deploying brutal tactics.

"No party in the Syrian conflict is capable of victory or stabilizing the country via military means alone," Tillerson warned, despite the regime's offensives.

International team of doctors visiting a Gaza hospital are stunned by the war’s toll on Palestinian children
============================================================================================================

[World](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world)
 Mar 28, 2024 1:59 PM EDT

DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza (AP) — An international team of doctors visiting a hospital in central Gaza was prepared for the worst. The majority of its intensive care unit beds are occupied by children, including infants wrapped in bandages and wearing oxygen masks.

“I spend most of my time here resuscitating children,” Haj-Hassan said after a recent shift. But the gruesome impact Israel’s war against Hamas is having on Palestinian children still left them stunned.

One toddler died from a brain injury caused by an Israeli strike that fractured his skull. Beside him was his sister, but he didn’t recognize her because burns covered almost her entire body.

These gut-wrenching casualties were described to The Associated Press by Tanya Haj-Hassan, a pediatric intensive-care doctor from Jordan, following a 10-hour overnight shift at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the town of Deir al-Balah.

Haj-Hassan, who has extensive experience in Gaza and regularly speaks out about the war’s devastating effects, was part of a team that recently finished a two-week stint there.

After nearly six months of war, Gaza’s health sector has been decimated. Many bring their children with them to the hospital to keep them close, Abu Qassim said.

“It’s just miserable,” he said.

Thousands of people driven from their homes by the war are also living in the hospital grounds, hoping it will be safe. Now, many Israelis must decide whether to go back](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/they-fled-kibbutzim-after-hamas-attacked-now-many-israelis-must-decide-whether-to-go-back)

Roughly half of Gaza’s 2.3 million people are 17 or younger, the U.N.’s agency for children estimates.

Israel holds Hamas responsible for non-combatants’ deaths and injuries because the militants in Gaza operate from within civilian areas. The Israeli government believes around 100 hostages being held in Gaza are still alive.

In the early stages of the war, Israel severely limited the entry of food, fuel and medical supplies into Gaza. Al-Aqsa Martyrs has also been short on anesthetics, meaning surgeries and other procedures are frequently performed without painkillers.

Haj-Hassan says there is only one way to end Gaza’s health care crisis.

“They need the war to stop,” she said.

 Mar 27 Roughly a dozen of Gaza’s 36 hospitals are only partially functioning. “What does that tell you about every other hospital in the Gaza Strip?”

A different team of international doctors working at Al-Aqsa Martyrs in January stayed at a nearby guesthouse."

### The sole survivor of her family

The baby's mother, her father Shukri Jouda, and toddler sister Malak — Arabic for angel — were also killed in the Israeli airstrike that hit the family's home in Rafah, according to information from the hospital morgue and extended family.

The day after the strike that killed the family, the baby's [uncle, Rami al-Sheikh, told cameras](https://news.sky.com/story/israel-hamas-war-sabreen-jouda-the-baby-girl-saved-from-dead-mothers-womb-in-gaza-dies-13123248#:~:text=Sabreen%20Jouda%20was%20born%20prematurely,care%20unit%20at%20another%20hospital.)
 he was ready to care for her. She was 5 days old.

### Increased airstrikes on Rafah kill mostly women and children

The newborn's death comes during an uptick in Israeli airstrikes on Rafah, where an estimated 1.4 million Palestinians have sought shelter in the nearly seven-month-long war that erupted Oct. More than 34,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war since then, according to Gaza health officials.

Israel's military says it is planning an [assault on Rafah](https://www.npr.org/2024/04/26/1246857306/rafah-gaza-israel-military-offensive)

 it is concerned about the toll an offensive in Rafah could have on civilians, even if they are told to evacuate.

Israel has said that Hamas battalions operate in Rafah. Women says, on average, two mothers have been [killed per hour](https://www.unwomen.org/en/news-stories/press-release/2024/01/press-release-two-mothers-are-killed-in-gaza-every-hour-as-fighting-exceeds-100-days)
