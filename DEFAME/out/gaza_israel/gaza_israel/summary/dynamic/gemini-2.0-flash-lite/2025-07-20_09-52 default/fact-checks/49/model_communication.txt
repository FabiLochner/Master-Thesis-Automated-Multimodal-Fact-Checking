Vice President Kamala Harris and Israel: A Record of Complicity, Not Change
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

* * *

! <image:1552>

By: Melissa Garriga 

Vice President Kamala Harris has often been portrayed as a more sympathetic figure toward the plight of Palestinians, a leader who might offer a nuanced approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Harris has accepted over half a million dollars from the pro-Israel lobby, and her actions, along with those of President Biden, underscore the administration's unwavering support for Israel's ongoing occupation and brutal campaign in Palestine. Harris has tried to strategically position herself as distinct from President Biden on Israel's genocide campaign in Gaza, calling for a ceasefire "for at least six weeks" in March 2024. The world is watching, and history will judge her accordingly.**_

### **[Kamala: We need a ceasefire and arms embargo NOW!](https://www.codepink.org/kamalastopisrael)

**![](https://assets.nationbuilder.com/codepink/pages/41993/attachments/original/1723826121/Tell_Vice_President_Harris_We_need_a_ceasefire_and_arms_embargo_NOW!.jpg?1723826121)**

* * *

_Melissa Garriga is the communications and media relations manager for CODEPINK. JDCA CEO Halie Soifer reminisced about Harris' 2017 trip to Israel, highlighting her "deep commitment to Israel's security and strong ties to the Jewish community." This trip, however, should not be romanticized—it was a clear signal of Harris's alignment with the pro-Israel lobby, a relationship that has only deepened over the years.

Harris's recent actions further illustrate her troubling stance. This selective outrage is not only hypocritical but also reveals a disturbing willingness to ignore atrocities committed by Israel while amplifying unsubstantiated claims against its Palestinians.

The [Jewish Current's 2020 article on Harris's ties to the AIPAC lobby group](https://jewishcurrents.org/restoring-the-bipartisan-consensus)
 paints an even clearer picture. Even when grassroots pressure mounted for Democratic candidates to distance themselves from AIPAC in 2019, Harris quietly met with AIPAC leaders, reaffirming her commitment to a strong U.S.-Israel alliance and combating anti-Semitism. When asked whether Israel meets international standards of human rights, Harris's response was a resounding "Overall, yes," a statement that starkly contrasts with the reality of Israel's human rights abuses.

The Vice President's stories of planting trees in Israel as a child are particularly tone-deaf."

The [Kremlin](/world/biden-kremlin-says-ukraine-war-is-more-important-2024-07-22/)
 said on Monday that Harris had made no noteworthy contribution to relations with Moscow except for statements "unfriendly towards our country." She has accused Russia of waging a "barbaric and inhumane" war in Ukraine.

On China, Harris has long positioned herself within Washington's bipartisan mainstream on the need for the U.S. 7, she has at times stepped out slightly ahead of the president in criticizing Israel's military approach.

In March, she [bluntly stated that Israel](/world/us-vp-harris-urges-israeli-government-do-more-boost-aid-into-gaza-2024-03-03/)

Halie Soifer, who served as national security adviser to Harris during the then-senator's first two years in Congress, said Harris' support of Israel has been just as strong as Biden's. Vice President Kamala Harris campaigns in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania <image:1560>

U.S. Harris was tasked at the start of his term with addressing the root causes of high irregular migration, and Republicans have sought to make her the face of the problem.

On a range of global priorities, said analysts, a Harris presidency would resemble a second Biden administration.

"She may be a more energetic player but one thing you shouldn't expect – any immediate big shifts in the substance of Biden's foreign policy," said Aaron David Miller, a former Middle East negotiator for Democratic and Republican administrations.

Harris has signaled, for instance, that she would not deviate from Biden's staunch support for NATO and would continue backing Ukraine in its fight against Russia. On a tour of the Demilitarized Zone between South and North Korea in September 2022 to reassert Washington's support for Seoul, she mistakenly touted a U.S. "alliance with the Republic of North Korea."

If Harris becomes her party's standard-bearer and can overcome Trump's lead in pre-election opinion polls to win the White House, the Israel-Palestinian conflict would rank high on her agenda, especially if the Gaza war is still raging.

Although as vice president she has mostly echoed Biden in firmly backing Israel's right to defend itself after Hamas militants carried out a deadly cross-border raid on Oct."

The Biden administration also tried to get humanitarian aid to the region with a $230 million floating pier, which [shut down after two months](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2024/07/11/us-pier-in-gaza-closes/74366780007/)

She also acknowledged Israel's need to address the threat Hamas poses.

, saying, "international humanitarian law must be respected."

WASHINGTON, DC – JULY 25: U.S. (Photo by Kenny Holston-Pool/Getty Images)

WASHINGTON — Vice President Kamala Harris, the likely Democratic nominee for president, met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Thursday afternoon, a day after he vowed to Congress that he wants “total victory” in the deadly Gaza war.

Harris said she and Netanyahu had a “constructive” meeting and that she expressed to the prime minister “serious concern about the scale of human suffering in Gaza.” Harris also said she stands by a two-state solution for the region as the “only path” to peace.

“I’ve said it many times, but it bears repeating: Israel has a right to defend itself, and how it does so matters,” Harris said during remarks from the White House following the meeting.

“What has happened in Gaza over the past nine months is devastating. But for the foreseeable future, we must retain overriding security control there to prevent the resurgence of terror, to ensure that Gaza never again poses a threat to Israel.”

Israel’s parliament [voted](https://main.knesset.gov.il/EN/News/PressReleases/Pages/press18724w.aspx)
 overwhelmingly on July 18 to disapprove of the establishment of an independent Palestinian state, bucking Biden’s longstanding advocacy for a two-state solution in the region.

Netanyahu’s meeting with Harris followed his afternoon meeting with Biden separately, and both then met with the families of hostages still held captive by Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip.

#### Harris appeals to protesters

Seemingly in reference to the uprising of protests across the U.S. stop providing aid and weapons to Israel.

Following Netanyahu’s near hour-long [address to lawmakers](https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/capitol-address-israeli-leader-calls-us-backing-defeat-hamas)
, demonstrators amassed outside the city’s Union Station, where they burned American flags and graffitied the words “Hamas is coming” among other messages on a statue and fountain dedicated to Christopher Columbus, according to [numerous](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/thousands-protest-near-us-capitol-ahead-netanyahu-speech-2024-07-24/)
 [media](https://www.fox5dc.com/news/entrances-closed-union-station-protests-erupt-following-netanyahus-speech)
 [reports](https://time.com/7003081/photos-netanyahu-washington-dc-protests-demonstrations-police-clashes-arrests-capitol/)
.

Harris issued a statement Thursday morning condemning the “despicable” events outside Union Station, just under a half-mile from the Capitol.

“I condemn any individuals associating with the brutal terrorist organization Hamas, which has vowed to annihilate the State of Israel and kill Jews. Netanyahu’s visit occurs as the Israel-Hamas war reaches nearly ten months. Vice President Kamala Harris, Netanyahu also met with U.S. We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering, and I will not be silent,” she said.

Harris said there has been “hopeful movement” for a cease-fire deal that includes the release of all hostages and a phased withdrawal of the Israeli military.

“And as I just told Prime Minister Netanyahu it is time to get this deal done,” she said.

#### Pressure on Harris over Gaza

Harris, now vying for president after President Joe Biden [exited the race](https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/president-joe-biden-bows-out-reelection-campaign-harris-vows-win-nomination-8)
 Sunday, will inevitably face demands and questions from voters, including reliably Democratic young and progressive blocs, who want to see an immediate and permanent cease-fire, and the release of all hostages.

Cease-fire negotiations have been stop-and-start for months, including on a [Biden-backed proposal](https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-urges-hamas-accept-new-israeli-ceasefire-plan-intended-end-war)
 announced in May.

The death toll in the Gaza Strip has surpassed 39,000 since Israel’s offensive began nearly 10 months ago, according to Gaza health officials in the Hamas-controlled Palestinian territory.

Netanyahu told lawmakers during a joint meeting of Congress in the U.S. over the Gaza war, Harris asked Americans to “encourage efforts to acknowledge the complexity, the nuance, and the history of the region.”

Netanyahu’s trip to Washington attracted thousands of protesters to areas surrounding Capitol Hill who demanded the U.S."

CNN  — 

Four days into the most consequential week of Kamala Harris’ political life, she confronted the most fraught foreign policy issue facing the country by looking directly into the eyes of an Israeli prime minister who decided not to even give her a passing name check in his address to Congress Wednesday afternoon.

Up until now, Harris has been defined by working for President Joe Biden, arguably the most explicitly pro-Israel American president, even though his relationship with Benjamin Netanyahu has frayed.

But now that she’s the presumptive Democratic nominee, Harris has to define what kind of president she wants to be — on this and every other issue, while Biden remains at the White House trying to [nail down a Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/25/politics/biden-netanyahu-meeting/index.html)
 and with some around him thinking that restarting the normalization of relations with Saudi Arabia could be a top legacy project for the remainder of his term.

Vice President Kamala Harris speaks following a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on the White House complex in Washington, Thursday, July 25, 2024. She still has photos of Harris taking out a traditional kippah head covering for Emhoff when they visited the Western Wall.

Soifer said she is satisfied that Harris remains committed to Israel — even after being read the indirect answer about whether the vice president considers herself a Zionist.

And Emhoff has stressed that even as this campaign picks up, he is going to keep talking about Judaism and Israel, as he has throughout this administration with his wife’s encouragement.

On a quickly organized Zoom call Wednesday afternoon hosted by the Jewish Democratic Council of America and Jewish Women for Kamala, where he made made a surprise appearance, Emhoff started by reiterating Harris’ unwavering support for Israel.

But he also told the story of not being with his wife on Sunday when the news broke about Biden exiting the race, dropping a little Yiddish by blaming “this flight mishigas” that had him stuck in Los Angeles.

Then he made a promise to the 1,700 people listening: “I’m going to keep living openly like a Jew and maybe there will be a mezuzah on the White House, like there is on the vice president’s residence.”

_This story has been updated with Harris’ remarks following her meeting with Netanyahu._

Harris didn’t preside over Netanyahu’s speech to Congress on Wednesday, instead choosing to stick with a pre-scheduled trip to a sorority event in Indiana, as antisemitic protests erupted near the US Capitol where fences were put up like in the days following the January 6, 2021, riot.

But after her meeting with the prime minister Thursday afternoon, she laid out what she wanted to be [a very clear position](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/25/politics/harris-netanyahu-israel-hamas-ceasefire)
, speaking to reporters in a way she has not done after previous meetings with foreign leaders.

Harris started by recalling a history of connection to Israel that dates back to her childhood collecting money to plant trees there, and she ran through her work in the administration. “This certainly seems to be a moment for a reconsideration of the relationship and for some fresh thinking on how to approach an Israeli political landscape that is lurching further to the right than we could have ever imagined.”

Murphy added, “I think we would all benefit from getting a fresh set of eyes on this conflict and the way that the United States could try to create a viable Palestinian state.”

A question of considering herself a Zionist
-------------------------------------------

But Harris has so many different pulls on her that an aide did not give a direct answer when asked if the vice president considers herself a Zionist — a term Biden again proudly embraced just weeks ago.

That’s a reflection of how much Zionism, which for a century meant believing in the right of a Jewish homeland to exist, has been co-opted by anti-Israel forces, who argue it has come to symbolize colonialism and the killing of Palestinians.

It’s also a reflection of the difference in thinking and rhetoric between the Democratic Party’s new standard bearer and a president who has made allegiance with Israel one of his defining positions for 50 years in national politics.

“The vice president has been a strong and longstanding supporter of Israel as a secure, democratic homeland for the Jewish people.

Harris is trying to clear up uncertainty about her position toward Israel, which has left even people who have talked in depth with her about it responding with pauses when CNN has asked whether, for example, she would have done the same as Biden in sending some, and halting other, weapons to Israel.

And her remarks follow a statement on Thursday condemning the protests around Netanyahu’s speech in Washington as unequivocal: “I condemn any individuals associating with the brutal terrorist organization Hamas, which has vowed to annihilate the State of Israel and kill Jews.”

Harris, the likely Democratic presidential nominee after Biden dropped out of [the election race](https://www.reuters.com/topic/event/us-elections/)
 on Sunday, did not mince words about the humanitarian crisis gripping Gaza after nine months of [war between Israel and Hamas militants](https://www.reuters.com/world/israel-hamas/)
.

"We cannot allow ourselves to be numb to the suffering and I will not be silent," she said.

Harris' remarks were sharp and serious in tone and raised the question of whether she would be more aggressive in dealing with Netanyahu if elected president on Nov. 7 when Hamas militants attacked southern Israel from Gaza, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 250 captives, according to Israeli tallies.

Israel's retaliatory attack in Gaza has killed more than 39,000 people and caused a humanitarian calamity with most of the coastal enclave leveled, people displaced from their homes, famine and a shortage of emergency relief.

Biden met with Netanyahu earlier and told him that he needed to close gaps to reach a ceasefire in Gaza and remove obstacles in the flow of aid, according to a readout of the meeting provided by the White House.

Netanyahu will meet Harris' Republican rival, Donald Trump, on Friday at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Florida.

"There has been hopeful movement in the talks to secure an agreement on this deal, and as I just told Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, it is time to get this deal done," Harris said.

Although as vice president she has mostly echoed Biden in firmly backing Israel's right to defend itself, she made clear on Thursday that she was losing patience with Israel's military approach.

"Israel has a right to defend itself. "Let's get the deal done so we can get a ceasefire to end the war."

 on Wednesday, Biden cited a desire for unity in the Democratic Party as it seeks to defeat Trump as a main reason he decided not to seek reelection but to instead support Harris for the 2024 race.

Harris maintains closer ties to Democratic progressives, some of whom have urged Biden to attach conditions to U.S. And how it does so matters," Harris said.

In March, she bluntly stated that Israel was not doing enough to ease a "humanitarian catastrophe" during its ground offensive in the Palestinian enclave.

She and President Biden are still pushing for a cease-fire deal that sees the hostages released, the fighting in Gaza to end and so "Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom and self determination."

Previously, Harris had not differed far from Biden's position on Israel and Gaza since the outset of the war. 22, 2024. 22, 2024. **Justin Sullivan/Getty Images** ****hide caption****

After much speculation, Vice President Harris, now the Democratic nominee for president, came out with the strongest remarks so far on where she stands on the Israel-Hamas war and the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.

"Let me be clear, I will always stand up for Israel's right to defend itself and I will always ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself," she said tonight. <image:1591>

Vice President Harris speaks on stage during the final day of the Democratic National Convention on Aug. She said that Israelis should "never again" go through the horror and "unspeakable" attacks of Oct."

What Kamala Harris has said on Israel, Gaza war
===============================================

Vice President Kamala Harris is unlikely to significantly deviate from President Joe Biden’s line on Israel during the election campaign, but she could harshen the tone if elected president.

US Vice President Kamala Harris and second gentleman Douglas Emhoff descend from Air Force Two at Delaware National Air Guard base in New Castle, Delaware, on July 22, 2024. "She will have to somewhat distance herself from Biden, but she is going to keep it very minimal," as Israel is not a key issue in the American presidential elections where immigration and inflation will dominate.

Considered to the left of President Joe Biden on the Gaza war and Israeli policy, Vice President [Kamala Harris](https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/07/gaza-iran-what-kamala-harris-middle-east-policy-could-look)
 is expected to adopt a slightly more critical approach of Israel's military conduct when she likely becomes the Democratic nominee for president — and an even harsher approach if she wins the election, experts tell Al-Monitor. 

"We don’t know enough," Ziegler Distinguished Fellow at The Washington Institute David Makovsky, who served on the US negotiating team during the 2013-2014 Israeli-Palestinian talks, told Al-Monitor. While Biden has had dealings with Netanyahu for four decades and touts their close relationship despite its obvious souring in recent months, Harris has met the Israeli premier only a handful of times. 

**Harris on the Gaza war**

Addressing the Munich Security Conference in February, Harris said that Hamas had used rape of Israeli women as a weapon of war, but she added that "we have also been clear that far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed, that Israel must do better to protect innocent civilians." On that occasion, Harris also called on Israelis and Palestinians to go back to the negotiating table, noting that "there cannot be, in my opinion, peace and security for that region — for the people of Israel or the Palestinians and the people of Gaza — without a two-state solution."

Harris’ call to protect the lives of Gaza civilians did not markedly differ from statements made by Biden. A White House readout after the meeting said Harris "raised the need to increase stability and security in the West Bank and hold extremist settlers accountable for violent acts." The Biden administration has imposed [sanctions](https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/07/extremist-west-bank-settlers-outposts-hit-us-sanctions)
 on several individuals and entities accused of committing violence against Palestinians in the West Bank. 

**Obama redux?**

Israeli and American experts warn it is too soon to have a clear picture on the policy Harris will espouse on Israel in general and on the Gaza war in particular, as she has not yet officially received the nomination as the Democratic Party candidate. On the other hand, she has been quite outspoken about Palestinian suffering in Gaza."

In making his assessment, Makovsky drew on the speech Harris delivered in Dubai last December, when she said that Israel "must do more to protect civilian life \[in Gaza\]." Reaffirming the Biden administration's stance that Israel had the right to defend itself against Hamas after the Gaza-based group's Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel, Harris also expressed concerns about widespread Palestinian suffering and warned that "international humanitarian law must be respected."

Contrary to high-ranking members of the Biden foreign policy and defense team, including US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, national security adviser Jake Sullivan, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Biden himself, among others, Harris has not traveled to Israel since Oct. Still, contrary to Biden, in a July 8 interview with The Nation, Harris went into greater detail on the suffering of Gazans. Harris referred to the issue of West Bank settlement and extremist settlers in her meeting in Washington last November with Israeli President Isaac Herzog. He very much sees himself as someone deeply, ideologically committed to Israel," Makovsky said.

"Despite the fact that she is married to a Jewish man, grew up in a Jewish political environment and has many Jewish friends, that does not mean that she has an emotional attachment to Israel, the kind that Biden or former President Bill Clinton have," former consul general in New York, adviser and chief of staff to four foreign ministers, and Haaretz columnist Alon Pinkas tells Al-Monitor. 

Pinkas says that Harris is likely to toe a similar line to former President Barack Obama on regional affairs."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence provides an Al-Monitor article that includes an image of Kamala Harris on July 22, 2024. However, the evidence does not contain the specific statement "Our support for Israel will continue" from that date. The NPR article from August 23, 2024, quotes Harris saying, "Let me be clear, I will always stand up for Israel's right to defend itself and I will always ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself." This statement, while related to support for Israel, is not the same as the one in the claim.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

GENE DEMBY, HOST:

What's good? One of the early ideas that inspired Baldwin's thoughts about Israel came out of the late 1880s.

ALAMED: And the idea that, you know, Black people, Black Americans - you know, speaking in American context - deserve a state, a country of their own.

ULABY: So back in the decades before James Baldwin was born, Nadia says a lot of Black intellectuals were incredibly inspired by the new Zionist movement that was emerging among Jews around the world.

DEMBY: Right. And that brings us to 1948 when James Baldwin wrote one of his first major essays.

DEMBY: 1948 - that was also the year Israel was created, right?

ULABY: Right. - 13 years old at the time.

ULABY: That visit changed James Baldwin's life but not in the way that he expected.

ALAMED: He thinks of Israel as, like, a safe haven for himself as a gay Black man. How do you define one people's freedom over - against another?

ALAMED: So that becomes a crucial step for him, and he will go back - Baldwin will go back to his trip to Israel many, many times in his writing.

DEMBY: When we come back...

FELDMAN: Baldwin shows us ways of sitting with history and sitting with pain, sitting with trauma, sitting with vulnerability.

DEMBY: That's after the break.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

DEMBY: Gene.

ULABY: Neda.

DEMBY: CODE SWITCH.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

DEMBY: So we're talking about James Baldwin, the writer and thinker whose ideas about race and power seem so prophetic that they continue to be rediscovered by new audiences at some of our most intense political moments. Both of us have stood outside the chalk circle awaiting our sentence, but the judge this time was not just.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

ULABY: James Baldwin, says Keith Feldman, saw his work as a writer as bearing witness.

FELDMAN: Bearing witness in an unvarnished way to injustice.

ULABY: So I asked, what does it have to tell us now at a moment of such pain and sorrow for Palestinians, Israelis, people across the Middle East, for us?

FELDMAN: Baldwin shows us ways of sitting with history and sitting with pain, sitting with trauma, sitting with vulnerability.

ULABY: And finding connections across cultures and geographies.

FELDMAN: Baldwin reminds us that the distance between here and there is much less than it might seem sometimes, and being able to bridge that distance is a political act and is also an act of the imagination.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

DEMBY: Once again, the story we just heard was reported by Neda Ulaby, a correspondent on NPR's culture desk. So on this episode, we're looking back to the writing of James Baldwin, whose views on the country transformed significantly over the course of his life. James Baldwin, the activist and author, was being profiled on ABC News.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

SYLVIA CHASE: James Baldwin is one of those lucky people who's never been unsure of his family's love.

DEMBY: The crew visited him at his home in Harlem and sat down for dinner with James Baldwin and his family.

(LAUGHTER)

DEMBY: And at one point, Baldwin makes this observation.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

JAMES BALDWIN: The American sense of reality is dictated by what Americans are trying to avoid.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

DEMBY: What Americans are trying to avoid - in that moment, Baldwin was talking about the American legacy of slavery."

From [Source](https://stevesalaita.com/james-baldwin-and-the-jewish-state/): 
Content: " Rather than dispensing platitudes about conflict and peace, he identifies Zionism as a concern of Western imperialism:

> Whenever Israel is mentioned one is required, it appears sometimes to me, to maintain a kind of pious silence.  Well, why?  It is a state like other states.  It has come into existence in a peculiar way.  But it does not, does not, become a state because people who wrote the Balfour Declaration, or Winston Churchill, or for that matter anyone in Europe, or in the Western world, really cared what happened to the Jews.  I wish I could say differently, but I would be lying if I did—it came into existence as a means of protecting Western interests at the gate of the Middle East. 

Baldwin reinforces this point when somebody from the audience questions the validity of implying that Israel “was set up to protect oil interests in that area.”  Baldwin responds:  “I said to protect the vital interests of the Western world, and I don’t mean to be sardonic or cynical, but I would be lying to you and lying by my own experience if I said to you that the Europeans—the English, the Dutch, the Germans, the French—impressed me as having any vivid concern for Jews.”  He returns to the theme of Jewish people being either disposable or instrumentalized in traditions of Western capitalism. 

For Baldwin, Zionism isn’t an atavistic cultural or religious attribute, but the modern articulation of an age-old colonial logic.  “In order to be a Zionist,” he notes, “it is not necessary to love the Jews.  I know some Zionists who are definitely anti-Semitic.”  This point impugns some of Zionism’s basic premises:  that Israel embodies Jewishness; that Israel is a necessary response to anti-Semitism; that Israel offers a utopian model of nationhood.  He has to be, since I am a black man, and, as he supposes, his only protection against the fate which drove him to [America](https://www.thenation.com/article/open-letter-born-again/)
.” 

Baldwin views Jewish aspirations to whiteness as a foolish conciliation to inherently hostile forces:  “But the state of Israel was not created for the salvation of the Jews; it was created for the salvation of the Western interests.  It happened to be, to spell it out, white South Africa. 

Here Baldwin reduces a baroque analysis to its essentials.  Zionism facilitates global structures of white supremacy and so cultural or religious investment in the ideology hinders an ethical politics.  Of course Israel sided with white South Africa.  Of course Israel expedites US and European machinations in the so-called Middle East.  That’s why it was created.  Destroying Palestine was a prelude to reactionary alliances. 

Last week, Facebook [revealed](https://www.apnews.com/7d334cb8793f49889be1bbf89f47ae5c)
 that an Israeli consulting firm has meddled in elections throughout the Global South, what a company spokesman called “a staggering diversity of regions.”  Baldwin wouldn’t have been surprised and neither should anybody else.  Israel, after all, is a longtime [interloper](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/israel-us-elections-intervention-russia-noam-chomsky-donald-trump-a8470481.html)
 in US elections.  In a world bifurcated according to geographies of wealth and deprivation, Israel serves the transnational class of war partisans, mercenary firms, and arms merchants. 

Baldwin recognized what too many luminaries in the Western left ignore:  Israel isn’t a reconstructed product of its surroundings or a benign ideal unmoored from some noble origin; it is a portal to limitless imposition of discipline onto an expendable, alien world.

24 thoughts on “James Baldwin and the Jewish State”
---------------------------------------------------

1. <image:1606>

For James Baldwin, nothing started or stopped at the borders of the United States.  His comments about Black-Jewish tension in the country of his birth took on worldly dimensions, offering unusual insight into domestic race relations, international affairs, and conflict in the Middle East. 

Baldwin wasn’t a policy wonk, but, befitting a person of his stature, he commented regularly on contemporary issues of global import.  Public figures don’t normally escape questions about Palestine and Israel; Baldwin was no exception.  The few times he spoke about the region reveal a thinker of significant prescience and a skilled rhetorician who doesn’t allow audiences the luxury of comfort. 

His most notable assessment of Zionism and Israel arose in context of a 1984 controversy surrounding then-Democratic presidential candidate Jesse Jackson, whose campaign represented a milestone in Black and progressive politics.  Jackson used the epithet “Hymietown” to describe New York City in what he thought was an off-the-record conversation with a journalist.  (“Hymie” is an anti-Jewish slur.)  When the comment was reported, it erupted into scandal. 

Baldwin, who claimed that “Jesse is singled out for particular reasons,” discussed the controversy at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, featured in [_The Cross of Redemption_](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.ca/books/7754/the-cross-of-redemption-by-james-baldwin-edited-with-an-introduction-by-randall-kenan/9780307275967)
, an anthology of uncollected talks, essays, and reviews (Baldwin was a stringent, at times unforgiving, reviewer).  Because the Q&A is transcribed, we get to witness Baldwin speaking extemporaneously. 

It is a remarkable document, in part because the audience doesn’t seem to get what Baldwin is saying.  Among other uses, the ideology shows how likely, even necessary, it is in imperialist cosmologies to uncouple humans who occupy a territory from the economic utility of nation-states that exist in their name. 

What does it mean to be an anti-Semitic Zionist?  (Baldwin is correct, by the way; evangelical Christian leaders, Western heads of state, and Gulf Arab billionaires all in some way fit the label.)  It shows, to begin with, that Zionism cannot deliver on its claim to preserve the well-being of Jewish people around the world.  It is first and foremost a state and as such will be oriented toward the interests of a domestic elite. for this insight take on James Baldwin’s (in turn) insightful comments on both Zionism – he nailed it – and Baldwin’s reminder – as if it needed saying – that overwhelmingly (there are a few who aren’t) that Jews, especially those of European Askinaze origins … are white!…
    
    The power of Baldwin’s thinking – far beyond his comments on Israel and the Palestinians – are returning to the mainstream after a long sleep. Pingback: [James Baldwin on Black-Jewish Relations, Israel and the United States – Tony Greenstein demo](https://demo.tonygreenstein.com/james-baldwin-on-black-jewish-relations-israel-and-the-united-states/)
    
8. 

Baldwin didn’t speak often of Israel, but he still managed to say plenty

!  A rupture facilitates interplay between colonization and capitalism:  confuse a people with the state, a formation devoted to inhuman pursuits, and the people will never live up to any kind of idealization; the state is incapable of—and uninterested in—the resolution of trauma. 

Anti-Semitic Zionists are possible because Israel benefits a chauvinistic ruling class; members of that class give zero shits about the health of the state’s inhabitants.  In fact, given the conditions of violence and accumulation in the Imperium, it’s _logical_ to dislike Jews and love Israel.  The alt-right didn’t [select Israel](https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/comment/2017/11/6/zionism-and-the-alt-right)
 as a model of statecraft at random. 

Baldwin wasn’t alone in this sort of analysis.  For over a century, Palestinian thinkers, along with a plethora of decolonial voices, have similarly implicated ethnonationalism.

CNN  — 

Gaza’s population dropped by 6% – about 160,000 people – in 2024, according to a new report, as Israel’s war against Hamas took a heavy toll on the Palestinian enclave’s demographics.

The Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) said in a report released Tuesday that about 100,000 Palestinians had left Gaza since the beginning of the war on October 7, 2023, in addition to at least 45,553 who were killed in Israeli attacks in the strip, according to official figures by the Palestinian Ministry of Health in the enclave.

The report also warned 60,000 pregnant women in Gaza were “endangered” due to the lack of adequate healthcare and 96% of the population were facing high levels of food insecurity.

Gaza’s population now stands at 2.1 million, including more than a million children under the age of 18, making up 47% of the population, PCBS’s report added.

Meanwhile, a separate report by Israel’s Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) found that Israel’s population was still growing – but more slowly than before – in a trend it attributed to Israelis leaving the country.

The Israeli report cautioned, however, that the full impact of Israel’s multi-front war on long-term migration pattern was yet to be seen.

In the report published Tuesday, the census office said that in 2024, Israel’s population grew by 1.1%, compared to 1.6% in 2023.

“The decrease is mainly due to the high number of Israelis emigrating from Israel in 2024,” it said, adding that last year, some 82,700 residents left Israel, compared to 55,000 the year before.

By December 31, 2024, Israel’s population was estimated at 10.027 million, the report said, topping the 10-million mark for the first time. In 2023, it was shaken by mass protests against controversial plans by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government to overhaul the country’s judicial system.

It then launched a war on Hamas in Gaza after the Palestinian militant group led brutal attacks that killed more than 1,200 people and kidnapped more than 250 on October 7, 2023. Israel’s attacks since then have killed more than 45,000 people and injured 108,000 in Gaza, according to the health ministry in the strip.

Israel is also fighting against the Iran-backed Hezbollah militant group in Lebanon, which began firing at Israel on October 8, 2023, as well as conflicts with Iran, the Houthis in Yemen, and militants in Syria and Iraq who say they are attacking Israel in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.

Israel has repeatedly rejected accusations of targeting civilians, saying it abides by international law and has a right to defend itself after the Hamas attack on October 7, 2023, which killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 251 hostages.

Israel has said it seeks to minimize civilian fatalities and stresses that Hamas uses Gaza’s civilians as human shields, fighting from civilian areas including homes, hospitals, schools, and mosques.

Some 83% of Gaza’s population are residing in the Israeli-designated “humanitarian zone,” according to IDF assessments in July.

The zone is located in the al-Mawasi area on the southern Strip’s coast, western neighborhoods of Khan Younis, and central Gaza’s Deir al-Balah. Israel says it has killed some 18,000 combatants in battle as of November, 2024, and another 1,000 terrorists inside Israel on October 7.

According to the PCBS, the population of Gaza has declined by about 160,000 during the course of the war to 2.1 million, with more than a million or 47% of the total under the age of 18. The data presented by the body this week claimed that there were approximately 60,000 pregnant women currently in the Strip, which would mean an increase in births despite the overall decline in population and ongoing grueling war.

The PCBS said some 22% of Gaza’s population currently faces catastrophic levels of acute food insecurity, according to the criteria of the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, a global monitor.

Included in that 22% are some 3,500 children at risk of death due to malnutrition and lack of food, the bureau said.

It added that Israel has “raged a brutal aggression against Gaza targeting all kinds of life there; humans, buildings and vital infrastructure… entire families were erased from the civil register. (Omar AL-QATTAA / AFP)

The population of Gaza has fallen 6 percent since the war with Israel began nearly 15 months ago as about 100,000 Palestinians left the enclave, while more than 55,000 are presumed dead, according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), citing Hamas figures.

Around 45,500 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, have been killed since the war began and another 11,000 are missing, the bureau said, citing numbers from the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry.

The Hamas figures cannot be verified and do not differentiate between civilians and fighters. <image:1646>

The **Gaza Strip**, also known simply as **Gaza**,[\[d\]](#cite_note-14)
 is a small territory located on the eastern coast of the [Mediterranean Sea](/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea "Mediterranean Sea")
; it is the smaller of the two [Palestinian territories](/wiki/Palestinian_territories "Palestinian territories")
, the other being the [West Bank](/wiki/West_Bank "West Bank")
, that make up the [State of Palestine](/wiki/State_of_Palestine "State of Palestine")
. Inhabited by mostly [Palestinian refugees](/wiki/Palestinian_refugees "Palestinian refugees")
 and their descendants, Gaza is one of the [most densely populated territories in the world](/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population_density "List of countries and dependencies by population density")
. An end of 2024 estimate puts the population of the Strip at 2.1 million, which was a 6% decline from the previous year due to the [Gaza war](/wiki/Gaza_war "Gaza war")
.[\[11\]](#cite_note-15)
 Gaza is bordered by [Egypt](/wiki/Egypt "Egypt")

 on the east and north. Israel's actions in Gaza since the start of the [war begun in 2023](/wiki/Gaza_war "Gaza war")

Etymology
---------

This section is an excerpt from [Gaza City § Etymology](/wiki/Gaza_City#Etymology "Gaza City")
.\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gaza_City&action=edit)\
\]

The name _Gaza_ first appears in military records of [Tuthmosis III](/wiki/Tuthmosis_III "Tuthmosis III")
 of [Egypt](/wiki/New_Kingdom_(Egypt) "New Kingdom (Egypt)")
 in the 15th century BC,[\[34\]](#cite_note-38)
 and was mentioned in the [Amarna correspondence](/wiki/Amarna_correspondence "Amarna correspondence")
 as _Āl Ĥazzati_ and other variant spellings.[\[35\]](#cite_note-39)
 In [Neo-Assyrian](/wiki/Neo-Assyrian "Neo-Assyrian")
 sources, reflecting the late [Philistine](/wiki/Philistine "Philistine")
 period, it was known as _Hāzat_.[\[36\]](#cite_note-40)
 It is clear the name originates from none of these languages, however.

Based on the city's [modern Hebrew](/wiki/Modern_Hebrew "Modern Hebrew")
 name, _ʻAzzā_, a common [folk etymology](/wiki/Folk_etymology "Folk etymology")
 insists the name stems from the Hebrew root _[ʻayin](/wiki/%CA%BBayin "ʻayin")
_\-_[zayin](/wiki/Zayin "Zayin")
_\-_zayin_, from which words related to strength and fierceness are derived,[\[37\]](#cite_note-Gaza_City_Masalha-41)
 but this is unlikely. ([Discuss](/wiki/Talk:Gaza_Strip#Split_section_History "Talk:Gaza Strip")<br>) _(February 2025)_ |

See also: [History of Gaza City](/wiki/History_of_Gaza "History of Gaza")

Historically part of the [Palestine region](/wiki/Palestine_region "Palestine region")
, the area was controlled since the 16th century by the [Ottoman Empire](/wiki/Ottoman_Empire "Ottoman Empire")
; in 1906, the Ottomans and the [British Empire](/wiki/British_Empire "British Empire")
 set [the region's international border](/wiki/Egypt%E2%80%93Gaza_border "Egypt–Gaza border")
 with [Egypt](/wiki/Egypt "Egypt")
.[\[39\]](#cite_note-:4-43)
 With the defeat of the [Central Powers](/wiki/Central_Powers "Central Powers")
 in [World War I](/wiki/World_War_I "World War I")
 and the subsequent [partition of the Ottoman Empire](/wiki/Partition_of_the_Ottoman_Empire "Partition of the Ottoman Empire")
, the British deferred the governance of the Gaza Strip area to Egypt, which declined the responsibility.[\[40\]](#cite_note-44)
 Britain itself kept and ruled the territory it occupied in 1917–18, from 1920 until 1948 under the internationally accepted frame of "[Mandatory Palestine](/wiki/Mandatory_Palestine "Mandatory Palestine")
".

### 1948–1959: All-Palestine government

Main articles: [All-Palestine Protectorate](/wiki/All-Palestine_Protectorate "All-Palestine Protectorate")
 and [All-Palestine Government](/wiki/All-Palestine_Government "All-Palestine Government")

During the [1948 Palestine war](/wiki/1948_Palestine_war "1948 Palestine war")
 and more specifically the [1948 Arab–Israeli War](/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War "1948 Arab–Israeli War")
, tens of thousands of [Palestinian refugees](/wiki/Palestinian_refugees "Palestinian refugees")
 [fled or were expelled](/wiki/1948_Palestinian_expulsion_and_flight "1948 Palestinian expulsion and flight")
 to the Gaza Strip.[\[41\]](#cite_note-Reuters-45)
 By the end of the war, 25% of Mandatory Palestine's [Arab](/wiki/Arab "Arab")
 population was in Gaza, though the Strip constituted only 1% of the land.[\[42\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFiliu201471-72-46)
 The same year, the [United Nations](/wiki/United_Nations "United Nations")
 Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East ([UNRWA](/wiki/UNRWA "UNRWA")
) was established to administer various refugee programmes.[\[43\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFiliu201476-47)

On 22 September 1948 (near the end of the Arab–Israeli War), in the Egyptian-occupied [Gaza City](/wiki/Gaza_City "Gaza City")
, the [Arab League](/wiki/Arab_League "Arab League")
 proclaimed the All-Palestine Government, partly to limit [Transjordan](/wiki/Jordan "Jordan")
's influence over Palestine. During the four-month Israeli occupation, 900–1,231 people were killed.[\[54\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFiliu2014105-58)
 According to French historian [Jean-Pierre Filiu](/wiki/Jean-Pierre_Filiu "Jean-Pierre Filiu")
, 1% of the population of Gaza was killed, wounded, imprisoned or tortured during the occupation.[\[54\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFiliu2014105-58)

### 1959–1967: Egyptian occupation

[Che Guevara](/wiki/Che_Guevara "Che Guevara")
 visiting Gaza in 1959

After the dissolution of the All-Palestine Government in 1959, under the excuse of pan-Arabism, Egypt continued to occupy Gaza until 1967. Thousands of homes were bulldozed and large numbers of Bedouin families were exiled to the Sinai.[\[60\]](#cite_note-64)
[\[61\]](#cite_note-65)
[\[62\]](#cite_note-66)

Between 1973 (after the [Yom Kippur War](/wiki/Yom_Kippur_War "Yom Kippur War")
) and 1987, official policy on economic development in the Gaza Strip remained the same as in 1969 with limited local investment and economic opportunity coming primarily from employment in Israel.[\[63\]](#cite_note-:7-67)

Gaza City in 1967

According to [Tom Segev](/wiki/Tom_Segev "Tom Segev")
, moving the Palestinians out of the country had been a persistent element of Zionist thinking from early times.[\[64\]](#cite_note-TSegev-68)
 In December 1967, during a meeting at which the [Security Cabinet](/wiki/Security_Cabinet_of_Israel "Security Cabinet of Israel")
 [brainstormed](/wiki/Brainstorming "Brainstorming")
 about what to do with the Arab population of the newly occupied territories, one of the suggestions Prime Minister [Levi Eshkol](/wiki/Levi_Eshkol "Levi Eshkol")
 proffered regarding Gaza was that the people might leave if Israel restricted their access to water supplies.[\[65\]](#cite_note-69)
 A number of measures, including financial incentives, were taken shortly afterwards to begin to encourage Gazans to emigrate elsewhere.[\[64\]](#cite_note-TSegev-68)
[\[66\]](#cite_note-70)
 Following the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, "various international agencies struggled to respond" and [American Near East Refugee Aid](/wiki/American_Near_East_Refugee_Aid "American Near East Refugee Aid")
 was founded to help victims of the conflict by providing immediate emergency relief.[\[67\]](#cite_note-71)

Israeli soldiers in Gaza in 1969

Subsequent to this military victory, Israel created the first [Israeli settlement](/wiki/Israeli_settlement "Israeli settlement")
 bloc in the Strip, [Gush Katif](/wiki/Gush_Katif "Gush Katif")
, in the southwest corner near [Rafah](/wiki/Rafah "Rafah")
 and the Egyptian border on a spot where a [small kibbutz](/wiki/Kfar_Darom "Kfar Darom")
 had previously existed for 18 months between 1946 and 1948. The commission deemed the rest of the cases illegal, and concluded with a recommendation calling on Israel to examine whether [war crimes](/wiki/War_crime "War crime")
 or [crimes against humanity](/wiki/Crimes_against_humanity "Crimes against humanity")
 had been committed, and if so, to bring those responsible to trial.[\[147\]](#cite_note-151)
[\[148\]](#cite_note-152)

On 28 February 2019, the Commission said it had "'reasonable grounds' to believe Israeli soldiers may have committed war crimes and shot at journalists, health workers and children during protests in Gaza in 2018." Israel refused to take part in the inquiry and rejected the report.[\[149\]](#cite_note-CNN1111-153)

### 2021: Israel–Palestine crisis

Before the [2021 Israel–Palestine crisis](/wiki/2021_Israel%E2%80%93Palestine_crisis "2021 Israel–Palestine crisis")
, Gaza had 48% unemployment and half of the population lived in poverty."

The Gaza Strip is a Palestinian territory of about 365 square kilometers and 2.1 million inhabitants, making it one of the world’s most densely populated regions. 
  
From 2008 onwards, in response to rocket attacks from Palestinian militants, Israel began its blockade of Gaza, causing the movements of [goods](/statistics/1423093/gaza-average-monthly-volume-of-incoming-goods/)
 and [people](/statistics/1423074/gaza-number-of-monthly-average-exits-to-or-via-israel/)

-------------------------

Before October 2023, there had been [four wars between Israel and Hamas](/statistics/1422874/palestinian-territories-duration-of-israeli-military-actions-in-the-gaza-strip/)
. [The electricity supply](/statistics/1422942/gaza-supply-of-electricity-by-provider/)

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence presents conflicting information. One source, a NYCFPA article from December 19, 2024, states that the population increased by 2.02% since October 7, 2023, based on August 2023 growth forecasts. However, other sources, including CNN and The Times of Israel, report a 6% *decrease* in population since October 7, 2023.

The claim is therefore **contradicted** by the majority of the evidence, which indicates a population decrease.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://www.thedailyfile.org/post/sham-imad-muhareb): 
Content: The Daily File states that the image is of Sham Imad Muhareb, who was 5 months old. The image was taken in Shuja'iya on April 10, 2025. <image:32>


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the image is of Sham Imad Muhareb. The image was taken in Shuja'iya on April 10, 2025. The evidence does not mention anything about the baby losing her arm or an Israeli airstrike.

The claim is partially verifiable. The evidence confirms the baby's identity and the location and date the image was taken. However, the claim's assertion about the baby not losing her arm in an Israeli airstrike cannot be verified with the provided evidence.

Israeli strike on Gaza residential building kills 29, medics say

Dozens of people were also wounded in the strike on a multi-storey building in Gaza City's Shejaiya neighbourhood

At least 29 Palestinians, including children, have been killed in an Israeli air strike on a multi-storey residential building in the east of Gaza City, a local hospital says.

The Hamas-run Civil Defence agency said warplanes targeted the area near al-Hawashi mosque in the Shejaiya neighbourhood on Tuesday morning.

It initially reported that 23 people were killed but warned its first responders were searching for two dozen others under the rubble. <image:1706>!AFP Palestinians search for survivors and bodies in the rubble of a residential building destroyed in an Israeli air strike, in the Shejaiya neighbourhood of Gaza City, northern Gaza (9 April 2025) <image:1709>AFP

Israel's military said the strike targeted a senior Hamas figure

Earlier on Tuesday, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said at least 33 people had been killed in Israeli attacks over the previous 24 hours.

That brought the reported total of those killed since Israel resumed its air and ground campaign against Hamas on 18 March to 1,482.

The Israeli military meanwhile said its aircraft had struck more than 45 "terror targets" across Gaza over the past day, including weapons manufacturing sites and rocket launchers.

It also said ground forces were advancing into Shejaiya as well as the so-called "Morag Corridor" in southern Gaza.

The military corridor is being established by seizing territory between the city of Rafah, whose residents have been ordered to evacuate, and neighbouring Khan Younis.

During a visit to the area on Wednesday, Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said: "We are now slicing through the strip, and we are increasing the pressure step by step, so that they \[Hamas\] will give us our hostages." ​

"All of Rafah will be evacuated and turned into a security area. Hamas used this aid to rebuild its war machine," spokesman Oren Marmonstein said.

On Monday, the heads of six UN humanitarian agencies had described Israel's assertion there was enough food for Gaza's 2.1 million population as "far from reality on the ground".

They called for the protection of civilians, the facilitation of aid deliveries, the release of the hostages held by Hamas, and the renewal of the ceasefire.

Mediators are continuing to try to resurrect the ceasefire, which started on 19 January and saw Hamas release 33 Israeli hostages - eight of them dead - and five Thai hostages in exchange for about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and a surge in humanitarian aid entering Gaza.

Israel said it resumed its offensive due to Hamas's refusal to accept a proposal for an extension of the ceasefire deal's first phase and the release of more of the 59 hostages it is still holding, up to 24 of whom are believed to be alive.

Hamas accused Israel of violating the original agreement, according to which there would be a second phase where all the remaining living hostages would be handed over and the war brought to a permanent end.

The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.

More than 50,840 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry.

_Correction 10 April 2025: This article originally said the Israeli defence minister was quoted by the Jerusalem Post. In the evening, it announced 15 bodies had been recovered, without giving an updated death toll.

The Israeli military said it had struck a "senior Hamas terrorist" who was responsible for planning and executing attacks in the area.

Numerous steps were taken to mitigate harm to civilians, including the use of "precision weapons", it added.

The military also accused Hamas of violating international law by deliberately using the civilian population as human shields.

Video from Shejaiya showed the dust-covered bodies of small children being carried away from the rubble by distraught relatives and rescue workers.

Ayub Salim, 26, told the AFP news agency the area around the residential building struck on Tuesday morning was "overcrowded with tents, displaced people and homes".

He said it was hit by "multiple missiles" and that "shrapnel flew in all directions".

"Dust and massive destruction filled the entire place, we couldn't see anything, just the screams and panic of the people," he added. "It is truly a horrific massacre."

Hamas also said the Israeli military had "committed a bloody massacre".

Thousands of Shejaiya residents fled last week after the Israeli military ordered the evacuation of much of the neighbourhood, saying it was operating with force to destroy "terrorist infrastructure".

But residents said the area struck on Wednesday was not covered by the evacuation order, so many families had remained there.

"We were told this was a safe area for the displaced, yet they are targeting residential blocks with lethal missiles. Do they fire rockets at the Israeli army?" an elderly man in Shejaiya told BBC Arabic's Gaza Lifeline programme.

! This is what we are doing now," he added, [according to the Ynet news website](https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1v6d4vryx)
.

The BBC has asked the Israeli military for comment.

Another 390,000 people have been displaced over the past three weeks, with two-thirds of the territory now designated by the Israeli military as "no-go" zones or placed under evacuation orders, according to the UN.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn7vje365rno)

The UN has also warned that supplies of food, medicine and fuel have dried up because Israel has prevented any deliveries of humanitarian aid for a month to put pressure on Hamas.

On Tuesday, Secretary General António Guterres condemned the Israeli blockade, saying it violated international law and had opened "the floodgates of horror".

"Gaza is a killing field and civilians are in an endless death loop," he added.

The Israeli foreign ministry rejected Guterres' criticism, saying he had "not let the facts get in the way when spreading slander against Israel".

"There is no shortage of humanitarian aid in the Gaza Strip - over 25,000 aid trucks have entered the Gaza Strip in the 42 days of the ceasefire."

*   An Israeli strike kills at least 27 people at a school building, army says militants were hit
*   Israel plans to expand security zones inside Gaza
*   Israel's evacuation orders cause hundred thousands Palestinian to quit their homes

CAIRO/GAZA, April 3 (Reuters) - Hundreds of thousands of fleeing Gazans sought shelter on Thursday in one of the biggest mass displacements of the war, as Israeli forces advanced into the ruins of the city of Rafah, part of a newly announced "security zone" they intend to seize.

A day after declaring their intention to capture large swathes of the crowded enclave, Israeli forces pushed into the city on Gaza's southern edge which had served as a last refuge for people fleeing other areas for much of the war.

Gaza's health ministry reported at least 97 people killed in Israeli strikes in the past 24 hours, including at least 20 killed in an airstrike around dawn in Shejaia, a suburb of Gaza City in the north.

Later on Thursday, an Israeli airstrike killed at least 27 Palestinians, including women and children, inside a school building that served as a shelter for displaced families in Gaza City, local health authorities said. We’re being killed while asleep," he said.

GAZANS FEAR PERMANENT DEPOPULATION

**\[1/10\]**Palestinians make their way with belongings as they flee their homes, after the Israeli army issued evacuation orders, in the Shujaiya neighborhood of Gaza City, April 3, 2025. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said troops were taking an area he called the "Morag Axis", a reference to an abandoned former Israeli settlement between Rafah and Khan Younis.

Gazans who had returned to homes in the ruins during the ceasefire have now been ordered to flee communities on the northern and southern edges of the strip.

They fear Israel's intention is to depopulate those areas indefinitely, leaving many hundreds of thousands of people permanently homeless while Israel seizes some of Gaza's last agricultural land and critical water infrastructure.

Since the first phase of the ceasefire expired at the start of March with no agreement to prolong it, Israel has imposed a total blockade on all goods for Gaza's 2.3 million residents, recreating what international organisations call a humanitarian catastrophe.

Israel's military said on Thursday it was [conducting an investigation](/world/middle-east/israeli-military-says-it-holds-special-probe-into-gaza-aid-worker-deaths-2025-04-03/)
 into the deaths of 15 Palestinian aid workers found buried in a shallow grave in March near Red Crescent vehicles, an incident that caused global alarm. We are afraid they might be killed or at best detained," said Basem, a resident of Rafah who declined to give a second name.

    9:57 AM UTC The Israeli military said the attack hit key Palestinian "terrorists."

Medics said three missiles slammed into the Dar Al-Arqam school building in Tuffah neighbourhood in Gaza City, and the Israeli military said it struck a command centre that had been used by militants to plan and execute attacks against Israeli civilians and army troops.

Rafah "is gone, it is being wiped out," a father of seven among the hundreds of thousands who had fled from Rafah to neighbouring Khan Younis, told Reuters via a chat app.

"They are knocking down what is left standing of houses and property," said the man who declined to be identified for fear of repercussions.

The assault to capture Rafah is a major escalation in the war, which Israel restarted last month after effectively abandoning a ceasefire in place since January.

In Shejaia in the north, one of the districts where Israel has ordered the population to leave, hundreds of residents streamed out on Thursday, some carrying their belongings as they walked, others on donkey carts and bikes or in vans.

"I want to die. REUTERS/Mahmoud Issa [Purchase Licensing Rights, opens new tab](https://www.reutersconnect.com/item/palestinians-flee-their-homes-after-the-israeli-army-issued-evacuation-orders-in-gaza-city/dGFnOnJldXRlcnMuY29tLDIwMjU6bmV3c21sX1JDMjhRREE3S09YWg%3D%3D/?utm_medium=rcom-article-media&utm_campaign=rcom-rcp-lead)

Israel has not spelled out its long-term aims for the security zone its troops are now seizing. Fighters still hold 59 dead and living hostages Israel says must be handed over to extend the truce temporarily; Hamas says it will free them only under a deal that permanently ends the war.

Israeli leaders say they have been encouraged by signs of protest in Gaza against Hamas, with hundreds of people demonstrating in north Gaza's Beit Lahiya on Wednesday. Hamas calls the protesters collaborators and says Israel is behind them.

The war began with a Hamas attack on Israeli communities on October 7, 2023 with gunmen killing 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages according to Israeli tallies. Israel's campaign has so far killed more than 50,000 Palestinians, Gaza health authorities say.

Rafah residents said most of the local population had followed Israel's order to leave, as Israeli strikes toppled buildings there."

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:32> This image shows Palestinian baby Sham Imad Muhareb which did not lose her arm in an Israeli airstrike on the Shejaeya neighborhood, east of Gaza City, in April 2025."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:32>)
web_search("Sham Imad Muhareb")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://www.thedailyfile.org/post/sham-imad-muhareb): 
Content: The Daily File states that the image is of Sham Imad Muhareb, who was 5 months old. The image was taken in Shuja'iya on April 10, 2025. <image:32>


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the image is of Sham Imad Muhareb. The image was taken in Shuja'iya on April 10, 2025. The evidence does not mention anything about the baby losing her arm or an Israeli airstrike.

The claim is partially verifiable. The evidence confirms the baby's identity and the location and date the image was taken. However, the claim's assertion about the baby not losing her arm in an Israeli airstrike cannot be verified with the provided evidence.

Content: "Before the war 2.4 million people lived on a 365-square-kilometre (140-square-mile) strip of land.

By December 1, 2024, nearly 69 percent of the buildings in Gaza had been destroyed or damaged, according to satellite imagery analysed by the UN's Satellite Centre (UNOSAT). Almost three-quarters of its buildings (74.2 percent) have been damaged or destroyed.

In Rafah, Gaza's southernmost city along the border with Egypt, the Israeli army launched a ground offensive in early May.

By the end of that month, nearly 48.7 percent of the buildings in Rafah had been hit, against 33.9 percent the previous month.

Although relatively spared compared with Gaza City, gutted facades and buildings stand testament to the scars of war.

Rights group Amnesty International said that more than 90 percent of the buildings along 58 square kilometres of Gaza's border territory with Israel appear to have been "destroyed or severely damaged" between October 2023 and May 2024.

The United Nations has estimated that reconstruction in the territory would take up to 15 years and cost as much as $50 billion.

\- Half of hospitals not functioning -

During the war, Gaza's hospitals have been repeatedly attacked by Israel, which accused Hamas of using them for military purposes, a charge the militant group denies.

Kamal Adwan hospital, one of the few medical facilities still operational in northern Gaza, is now empty and out of service since a major Israeli strike in late December, according to the World Health Organization.

By December 31, just 18 of Gaza's 36 hospitals, or half, were partially functioning, according to the WHO, with a total capacity of 1,800 beds.

Data from UNOSAT and geographic database OpenStreetMap also indicates that more than 83 percent of Gaza's mosques have been damaged or destroyed.

\- Nearly 90 percent of schools damaged -

The territory's largely UN-run schools, where many civilians have sought refuge from the fighting, have also paid a heavy price, with the Israeli military accusing Hamas of using them to conceal fighters.

As of December 1, 2024, UNICEF counted 496 schools damaged -- nearly 88 percent of its count of 564 facilities. [Skip to main content](#main-content)

Destruction in the Gaza Strip — Nalini LEPETIT-CHELLA, Thierno TOURE, Valentina BRESCHI

The war in the Gaza Strip between Israel and Hamas, which on Wednesday agreed a ceasefire, has killed tens of thousands of people and created a humanitarian disaster.

The fragile ceasefire deal is due to start on Sunday, but still has to be approved by Israel's cabinet.

The sheer scale of bombardment and violence of the fighting have disfigured the densely populated Palestinian territory's urban landscape.

AFP looks at the material impact of the war.

\- 170,000 buildings damaged or destroyed -

Gaza is one of the most densely populated places on the planet. That amounts to 170,812 buildings.

US researchers Corey Scher and Jamon Van Den Hoek, who use satellite imagery with different methodology, counted 172,015 damaged or destroyed buildings in Gaza on January 11, 2025.

Hamas's unprecedented October 7, 2023, attack on Israel resulted in the death of more than 1,200 people on the Israeli side, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.

That figure includes hostages killed while in captivity in the Gaza Strip.

Since October 7, 2023, at least 46,788 Palestinians, most of them civilians, have been killed in Israel's military campaign in Gaza, according to data provided by the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.

Those figures are acknowledged as reliable by the UN.

\- Rafah city half destroyed -

Before the war, Gaza City in the territory's north was home to some 600,000 people. That includes 79 percent of agricultural land in north Gaza and 57 percent of such land in Rafah.

The destruction of irrigation systems, orchards, machinery and barns is even greater, with between 80 percent and 96 percent "decimated" since the beginning of 2024, according to a report from the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in September.

In addition, 68 percent of Gaza's road network has been damaged.

About 1,190 kilometres (740 miles) of roads have been destroyed, 415 kilometres badly damaged and 1,440 kilometres moderately damaged, according to a preliminary analysis by UNOSAT, taking into account data up to August 18.

The agency has conducted threat and risk assessments throughout the Territory, and has developed advanced GeoAI and remote sensing techniques, including 3D modeling technologies, to enhance explosive hazard evaluation and rubble removal strategies.

UNOPS Executive Director Jorge Moreira da Silva, following a recent trip to Gaza, says explosive hazard education had been provided to 250,000 Palestinians and some 1,000 humanitarian workers, providing “critical knowledge to stay safe and navigate explosive hazards effectively.”

UNDP’s Sarah Poole says about 28,500 tons of rubble were initially removed, and 290 tons of it used for roadworks to enhance humanitarian operations, restoring access to sites such as a hospital, a bakery and a critical water supply plant.

Poole describes the issue of land and property ownership in Gaza as “very complex” – particularly when title deeds, inheritance records and other legal documents are lost or destroyed. Like others returning to northern Gaza after months of being displaced by war, Sufian Al-Majdalawi clings to whatever he can find.

Using small tools and his bare hands, he sifts through mounds of twisted debris and dirt to try and unearth belongings and important paperwork such as property deeds to prove he is the legal owner.

He dreams of one day being able to rebuild; in the short-term, he hopes that even the rubble might hold some value.

The war in Gaza has left an unprecedented level of destruction, with an estimated 51 million tons of rubble blanketing the landscape where bustling neighborhoods once thrived.

According to a new UN [damage and needs assessment report](https://palestine.un.org/en/289429-gaza-and-west-bank-interim-rapid-damage-and-needs-assessment-february-2025)
, over 60 per cent of homes – amounting to some 292,000 – and 65 per cent of roads have been destroyed, across the approximately 360 square kilometre enclave.

As the international community ponders Gaza’s future and how to rebuild, Al-Majdalawi is sure of one thing: “We will not leave. The costs of recovery and reconstruction are estimated at over $53 billion.

At night he sleeps under a tarpaulin sheet on the ruins of his family home. “Maybe while I am removing the rubble, I will find a human body, an explosive device,’’ he adds, underlining the huge emotional and physical risks of dislodging debris in a war zone.

Working with Palestinian authorities, UN [development](https://www.undp.org/papp)
 and [environmental](https://www.unep.org/)
 agencies and non-governmental organizations are looking at how to safely clear the rubble so that families can rebuild.

With a fragile ceasefire in place, regional talks are underway on rebuilding Gaza after 16 months of conflict. 
  
Amjad Al-Shawa, Director of the network of NGOs in the Gaza Strip, says the issue of rubble represents a “major challenge.’’  
  
“We need a mechanism to dispose of the rubble which will take a long time, and which requires resources that are not available in the Gaza Strip,’’ he says. Many disputes may arise between families.’’  
  
Some $7 million has already been made available from various donors to aid the rubble removal – but Poole says an additional $40 million is needed “in this initial phase in order to significantly scale up the work.”

“The issue of access and the ability to bring in some of the heavy equipment that is needed is also absolutely essential,” he adds.

The challenge ahead looks daunting: Once-thriving neighborhoods have been leveled – very little remains. “We want to live.’’

Al-Majdalawi is adamant, though: “We are capable of rebuilding the land.”

But there remains a major impediment — Arab countries are not in agreement on what governance of Gaza should look like after the conflict, the official said.

When it comes to the more immediate needs in Gaza, given the horrific humanitarian situation there for Palestinians in recent months, Blinken will evaluate improvements Israel made — and steps that still need to be taken — since the administration sent a letter to Israel pressuring them to take more actions to get the aid into Gaza, the official said.

The Iranian mission to the United Nations said the United States would be “complicit” in any Israeli aggression against Iran if it emboldened Israel by providing it with advanced weaponry.

The letter also accused US President Joe Biden of making “inflammatory” remarks at a press briefing in Berlin on October 18, during which Biden said he had a good understanding of how and when Israel would respond to Iran’s October 1 missile attack.

The Iranian mission said his comments signaled Washington’s “tacit approval and explicit support for Israel’s unlawful military aggression against Iran.”

Hezbollah says it carried out 31 attacks against Israel and its troops in southern Lebanon, according to a group statement early Tuesday local time.

The attacks involved rockets, missiles, and drones and were carried out in support of Palestinians in Gaza and the “defense of Lebanon and its people,” the group’s statement read.

Hezbollah said it had confronted Israeli forces attempting “to advance” on the Lebanese border, and it had also conducted “operations against the sites, bases, and deployment of the Israeli enemy army and settlements in the north (of Israel.)”

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement that Hezbollah had on Monday fired “approximately 170 projectiles” that “crossed from Lebanon into Israel.”

 in northern Gaza, where a two-week Israeli military campaign has killed hundreds of people and left thousands trapped.

Requests by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) to enter the Al-Faluja area of Jabalya to help those trapped under rubble had been denied by Israeli authorities for four consecutive days, Haq told the briefing.

 in an Israeli strike outside Rafik Hariri University Hospital, considered the largest public hospital in Beirut, the Lebanese health ministry said Monday night. Both President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris renewed calls for restarting the negotiations in the wake of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar’s killing.

US officials have had “some initial conversations,” Kirby said, with Israeli counterparts and “continue to engage in intensive diplomacy to see what can be done to try to find a path to a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah.”

The US has also expressed a “strong desire to see what can be done to find a diplomatic path forward to get the hostages home,” he said.

US envoy Amos Hochstein is in Beirut Monday, Kirby noted, where he is working “to see what could be in the realm of the possible in terms of trying to find a meaningful ceasefire.”

Earlier, CNN reported that US Secretary of State Antony Blinken will depart Monday for a [high-stakes trip to Israel and the Middle East](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk#cm2ithpdg000v3b6mdl7hlrrh)

President Joe Biden is “deeply concerned” following the [leak of highly classified US intelligence](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/19/politics/us-israel-iran-intelligence-documents/index.html)
 on Israel’s plans to attack Iran and will be “actively monitoring” the investigation, according to national security spokesperson John Kirby.

He added: “You can rest assured that he will be actively monitoring the progress of the investigative effort to figure out how this happened, and obviously he’ll be very interested in hearing any mitigation measures and recommendations that come as a result of the investigative efforts.”

Kirby added that they do not yet know how the documents were released and that the Department of Defense is continuing their investigation.

Kirby also said that “at this time” they have no reason to believe similar documents will be released.

“We don’t have any indication at this point that there’s an expectation that there will be additional documents like this finding their way into the public domain,” he said.

Kirby also confirmed that the US has been in communication with the Israelis about the disclosure, but did not provide any details of those conversations.

**More background:** The documents, dated October 15 and 16, began circulating online Friday after being posted on Telegram by an account called “Middle East Spectator.” They are marked top secret and have markings indicating they are meant to be seen only by the US and its “Five Eyes” allies — Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.

As US Secretary of State Antony Blinken heads to Israel, President Joe Biden’s administration is unclear about what the coming weeks will hold for the future of Hamas as well as Gaza hostage and ceasefire talks, a senior State Department official said, according to press pool.

While the US is trying to take advantage of [Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar’s death](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/17/middleeast/israel-hamas-leader-yahya-sinwar-gaza-intl/index.html)
 to push the Israel-Hamas conflict closer to a resolution, the group needs to figure out its leadership in order to get back to the table, the official said. “Now they are doing it in Lebanon.”

An Israeli strike near Lebanon’s biggest public hospital on Monday night was not in an area covered by evacuation orders issued by the military, a CNN analysis of the strike and maps of no-go zones has found.

Before the strike, Israel’s military issued a slew of evacuation orders for Beirut’s southern suburbs, with maps indicating specific buildings slated for targeting, along with 500-meter radius no-go zones around those targets.

The area surrounding Rafik Hariri University Hospital, which was hit in one of several Israeli airstrikes on Monday, was not included in those instructions, nor in any evacuation orders published since Israel ramped up strikes against Hezbollah last month.

The strike near the hospital killed at least four people — including a child — and caused “a lot of damage” to the hospital, according to Lebanon’s Health Ministry.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it hit a “Hezbollah terrorist target” in a strike near the hospital, insisting that the hospital itself was not hit, targeted or affected by the strike.

The Lebanese health ministry said earlier the strike killed at least four people, wounded 24 others, and caused “a lot of damage” at the hospital.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it has hit thousands of Hezbollah targets since ground operations started in southern Lebanon on October 1.

The Israeli forces had “struck over 3,200 terror targets, including hundreds of weapons storage facilities, rocket launchers, anti-tank posts, terrorist infrastructure, and command-and-control centers,” the IDF said in a statement Monday.

“Of these, approximately 300 targets were hit in the last 24 hours alone,” the IDF read.

The IDF also claimed it killed dozens of Hezbollah members since October 1, including “seven Hezbollah brigade commanders, 21 battalion commanders, and 24 company commanders.”

Rafik Hariri University Hospital is considered the largest public hospital in Lebanon.

Another 24 people were wounded in the strike, according to a preliminary toll from the ministry. When asked for comment by CNN, the IDF referred to Hagari’s press statement on the strike in Syria.

Israel has designated the Hezbollah-linked financial institution Al-Qard Al-Hassan as “a terrorist organization,” a day after striking several of its branches across Lebanon.

“The designation is part of a wider campaign led by Israel’s defense establishment, targeting the economic resources of Hezbollah and other terrorist organizations,” Israel’s defense ministry said in a statement Monday.

The ministry said intelligence indicated Al-Qard Al-Hassan was used to finance Hezbollah’s operations “via the purchase of munitions, payment of salaries to terrorists, and storing Hezbollah funds.”

The Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Daniel Hagari accused Al-Qard Al-Hassan of violating international law, noting it had been “sanctioned by the United States and other Western countries.”

Tsafrir Abayov/AP

Hundreds of right-wing Israeli activists — including government ministers and members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s parliamentary coalition — attended an event Monday calling for the Israeli government to establish Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip.

Senior ministers who attended the event near the Gaza border included National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and Minister for Social Equality and Minister for Women’s Empowerment May Golan.

While the Israeli prime minister has said Israel does not intend to settle Gaza, Golan was among several members of Netanyahu’s Likud party who participated, in addition to Ben Gvir’s Otzma Yehudit (Jewish Power) and Smotrich’s Religious Zionist Party.

Calls for Israeli settlements in Gaza were accompanied by calls for the expulsion of the strip’s Palestinian population.

“As a result of the brutal massacre of the 7th of October, the Gaza Arabs lost the right to be here,” Daniella Weiss, known as the [godmother of the Zionist settler movement,](https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/20/middleeast/israel-gaza-settlers-daniella-weiss/index.html)
 said to cheers and applause. The IDF said it hit a “[Hezbollah terrorist target](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk#cm2jlcyel00003b6n206rj0xb)

 and that Israel made similar allegations in Gaza before targeting medical facilities.

• Meanwhile, the UN warned [almost no aid is entering the Jabalya refugee camp](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk#cm2jlkf8w000h3b6ntv25t5iw)

The head of the United Nations’ Palestinian refugee agency has accused Israel of preventing aid from reaching northern Gaza, where hundreds of thousands of people face a dire humanitarian situation amid a renewed Israeli military offensive.

UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini [wrote in an X post](https://x.com/UNLazzarini/status/1848330806084726795)
 on Monday that Israel continues “to deny humanitarian missions to reach the north \[of Gaza\] with critical supplies including medicine and food.”

UNRWA’s “remaining shelters are so overcrowded, some displaced people are now forced to live in the toilets,” Lazzarini added, as he as he urged Israel to allow access for UN teams.

“Denying & weaponizing humanitarian assistance to achieve military purposes is a sign of how low the moral compass is,” he said. Agence France-Presse news agency footage showed large plumes of smoke rising around south Beirut’s skyline Monday night.

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also [raised alarm about Israeli attacks](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk#cm2jdttub00133b6n1gsjy7ns)
 on hospitals in northern Gaza, saying “patients and medical staff must be protected. This comes as the White House said it was clear-eyed about the status of a diplomatic outcome in Gaza or Lebanon, conceding that negotiations toward a ceasefire [are not “about to restart.”](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk#cm2j90gwd00003b6nqc6a3w8s)
    
*   **US intelligence leak:** President Joe Biden said he was “deeply concerned” following [the leak of highly classified US intelligence](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/19/politics/us-israel-iran-intelligence-documents/index.html)
     on Israel’s plans to attack Iran and will be “actively monitoring” the investigation, according to national security spokesperson John Kirby."

According to security expert Sobelman, Israel had spent two decades preparing for the next war with Hezbollah.[\[94\]](#cite_note-cnn20241012-100)

Shortly after the onset of the [Gaza war](/wiki/Gaza_war "Gaza war")
 in October 2023, Hezbollah joined the conflict, citing solidarity with Palestinians,[\[95\]](#cite_note-aj-101)

 (UNSCR 1701) and withdraw its forces north of the [Litani River](/wiki/Litani_River "Litani River")

Strikes targeted Al-Qard Al-Hassan buildings in Beirut’s southern suburbs, south Lebanon and the Bekaa valley

*   [Middle East crisis – live updates](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/oct/21/middle-east-crisis-live-israel-strikes-beirut-idf-may-be-destroying-population-in-north-gaza-un-body-says)
    

Israel carried out a series of airstrikes on the southern suburbs of Beirut, south Lebanon and the Bekaa valley early on Monday morning, hitting buildings belonging to the Hezbollah-run banking institution Al-Qard Al-Hassan.

At least 10 airstrikes were carried out in the southern suburbs of the capital, with an entire building collapsing and a jet of fire streaming into the air in the Chiyah neighbourhood. Blinken will also address improvements in humanitarian aid access to Gaza, which the US said could result in reductions in arms supplies to Israel if aid continues to be prevented from reaching the beleaguered strip.

On Monday, Israeli forces besieged hospitals and shelters for displaced people in the north of Gaza as they stepped up their operations against Palestinian militants, residents and medics said.

Before the bombings in Lebanon, Israel issued several warnings via X , pinpointing buildings belonging to Al-Qard Al-Hassan in the southern suburbs of Beirut and across Lebanon and warning people to move at least 500 metres away from these buildings. The Israeli military said on Sunday night that Al-Qard Al-Hasssan financed Hezbollah and the group “uses this money to finance its terrorist activities”, including buying and storing arms.

The announcement that Israel would start targeting the bank, a part of Hezbollah’s civilian institutions, signified an expansion of the scope of Israel’s targets from just the group’s military wing. Its progress is unclear, as the border areas have been virtually depopulated and media access is limited.

On Monday afternoon, Hochstein said implementation of the UN security council resolution 1701 was the path towards a ceasefire in Lebanon and rejected calls to amend the UN agreement.

Resolution 1701 ended the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war and has since been the framework that governs security dynamics on the Lebanese-Israeli border. The resolution also dictated that Israeli forces withdraw from Lebanon.

“The non-implementation of resolution 1701 is the reason for the intensification and continuation of this conflict,” Hochstein said after meeting Berri, who negotiates on behalf of Hezbollah. Lebanese officials are likely to reject the new demands, which would be seen as encroaching on the country’s sovereignty.

Gaza explosions rattle central Israel; scientist explains why
=============================================================

Locals reported hearing loud blasts Friday night, likely stemming from IDF strikes in Gaza, over 40 miles away; why do sounds of blasts from Gaza reach central Israel, how does weather play a role and why are they louder at night? Here’s the explanation

Residents of central Israel, including the Gush Dan and Shephelah regions, reported hearing loud explosions Friday night and early Saturday. The IDF confirmed no rocket impacts in the area while police attributed the sounds to explosions originating in Gaza, more than 40 miles away.

Dr. Yuval Rosenberg, a physicist at the Davidson Institute of Science Education, explained to Ynet that atmospheric conditions can affect how sound travels, amplifying or diminishing its intensity. “When the air near the ground is warmer due to the sun heating the surface, sound waves are refracted upward into the sky. This can reduce the noise we hear,” he explained.

However, during nighttime, when the ground cools faster than the air above it, sound waves bend back toward the ground. “This phenomenon is why explosions from Gaza often sound louder in central Israel at night than during the day,” Dr. Rosenberg added.

The unique interaction of weather and sound physics highlights why certain noises travel farther or seem more pronounced depending on the time of day and environmental conditions.

In addition to explosions heard from Gaza, powerful booms have echoed through the Gush Dan region during the war, caused by rockets detonating over the sea. These loud blasts have sparked anxiety among residents due to their intensity.

“There are many factors that can influence the volume of an explosion we hear, meaning identical rockets detonating can sound vastly different,” explained Dr. Yuval Rosenberg. “The sound waves we perceive are essentially small disturbances in air pressure, which our brain interprets as sound after they reach our ears and vibrate the eardrum and the rest of our auditory system.”

“When a rocket explodes, it creates a shockwave characterized by a sudden and significant change in air pressure,” explained Dr. Rosenberg. “At close range, this shockwave can be extremely dangerous, capable of destroying buildings or killing marine life if the detonation occurs at sea.

"As it travels, the shockwave loses energy as it interacts with and is absorbed by objects, creating destruction but also heating the air. Eventually, as it continues over long distances, the shockwave dissipates and transforms into the sound waves we hear. Simply put, a shockwave is like a massive ocean swell that breaks into smaller waves.”

Dr. Rosenberg highlighted the difference in how explosion sounds carry over land versus sea. “For us to clearly hear the explosion, a significant amount of sound waves must reach our ears, or more precisely, the sound wave intensity must remain strong. However, various factors can block sound waves from reaching us. For instance, shockwaves and sound waves can be absorbed by the ground, trees and buildings. Hard surfaces like hills or building walls can also reflect sound waves, preventing them from reaching us,” he said.

“This is why when a rocket explodes on land, there are many obstacles that diminish the volume of the noise we hear. In contrast, over the sea, there are few such barriers, allowing sound waves to travel more freely and reach us more effectively,” he added.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The CNN article ([https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk)) discusses the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, including an Israeli strike near Rafik Hariri University Hospital in Beirut on October 21, 2024. The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Israeli_invasion_of_Lebanon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Israeli_invasion_of_Lebanon)) discusses the 2024 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, which began on October 1, 2024.

The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/21/israeli-airstrikes-on-lebanon-hit-branches-of-hezbollah-linked-bank-al-qard-al-hassan](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/21/israeli-airstrikes-on-lebanon-hit-branches-of-hezbollah-linked-bank-al-qard-al-hassan)) reported on Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon on October 21, 2024, targeting branches of the Hezbollah-linked bank Al-Qard Al-Hassan. The article includes images of the damage (<image:1786>

### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:35>

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The provided evidence confirms that there were Israeli attacks on Lebanon on October 21, 2024. The CNN article ([https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk)) and The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/21/israeli-airstrikes-on-lebanon-hit-branches-of-hezbollah-linked-bank-al-qard-al-hassan](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/21/israeli-airstrikes-on-lebanon-hit-branches-of-hezbollah-linked-bank-al-qard-al-hassan)) both report on these attacks.

However, the evidence does not provide information about the specific image <image:35>. Therefore, I cannot verify if the image depicts an Israeli attack on Lebanon on October 21, 2024.

I need more information to verify the claim.

The CNN article ([https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk)) discusses the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, including an Israeli strike near Rafik Hariri University Hospital in Beirut on October 21, 2024. The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Israeli_invasion_of_Lebanon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Israeli_invasion_of_Lebanon)) discusses the 2024 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, which began on October 1, 2024.

The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/21/israeli-airstrikes-on-lebanon-hit-branches-of-hezbollah-linked-bank-al-qard-al-hassan](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/21/israeli-airstrikes-on-lebanon-hit-branches-of-hezbollah-linked-bank-al-qard-al-hassan)) reported on Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon on October 21, 2024, targeting branches of the Hezbollah-linked bank Al-Qard Al-Hassan. The article includes images of the damage (<image:1786>

### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:35>

## Elaboration
The provided evidence confirms that there were Israeli attacks on Lebanon on October 21, 2024. The CNN article ([https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk)) and The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/21/israeli-airstrikes-on-lebanon-hit-branches-of-hezbollah-linked-bank-al-qard-al-hassan](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/21/israeli-airstrikes-on-lebanon-hit-branches-of-hezbollah-linked-bank-al-qard-al-hassan)) both report on these attacks.

However, the evidence does not provide information about the specific image <image:35>. Therefore, I cannot verify if the image depicts an Israeli attack on Lebanon on October 21, 2024.

I need more information to verify the claim.

**Volodymyr Zelensky is meeting Joe Biden and Kamala Harris at the White House to discuss his "victory plan", which the Ukrainian president hopes will pressure Russia into agreeing a diplomatic end to the war.**

Details have been kept secret, but Zelensky is likely to ask the US president and vice-president for continuing military and financial support, as well as security guarantees.

It comes amid a row with Donald Trump and the Republican party ahead of November's US presidential election.

They were angered by Zelensky's visit to an arms factory in Biden's hometown of Scranton with top Democrats. Zelensky will meet Trump on Friday despite earlier reports that the meeting had been cancelled.

Zelensky's visit to the ammunition factory in the key swing state of Pennsylvania was labelled by leading Republicans as a partisan campaign event.

In a public letter, speaker of the US House Mike Johnson said the visit was "designed to help Democrats" and claimed it amounted to "election interference".

He also demanded that Ukraine fire its ambassador to Washington who helped arrange the visit.

The Republican-led House Oversight Committee has also announced it would investigate whether Zelensky's trip was an attempt to use a foreign leader to benefit Harris's campaign.

Her Republican rival for the presidency, Donald Trump, mocked Zelensky at a campaign event as the "greatest salesman on Earth" and accused him of refusing to "make a deal" with Moscow.

Earlier this week, Trump also praised Russia's military capabilities, saying: "They beat Hitler, they beat Napoleon - that’s what they do, they fight."

The two men have long had a fractious relationship. In 2019, Trump was impeached by the US House over accusations that he pressured Ukraine's leader to dig up damaging information on a political rival.

The row clouded a week in which Zelensky has twice addressed the United Nations, ramping up efforts to persuade the US and other allies to boost support more than two and a half years into Russia's full-scale invasion.

At the White House meetings, Zelensky is expected to push again for US backing to fire Western-made long-range missiles deep into Russian territory, which Biden has so far blocked.

Before the meeting, Biden said: "Let me be clear, Russia will not prevail in war... Ukraine will prevail".

He also pledged to support Kyiv "in its path to membership to both the EU and Nato".

Meanwhile, Zelensky thanked the US for its "unwavering bipartisan support".

He later met Harris, with the vice-president reiterating her support for Ukraine and arguing the US must continue its role of global leadership.

With Russian troops advancing in the east of Ukraine, the outcome of Zelensky's meeting with Biden and Harris is seen by many experts as a key moment in his attempt to shore up US support before the November election.

On Wednesday, Russia's Vladimir Putin announced a plan to revise Moscow's nuclear doctrine, to enable Russia to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states if they are supported by nuclear states.

Putin's spokesperson later clarified that it was meant as a "specific signal" to the West.

Hours before his meeting with Zelensky, Biden announced a $7.9bn (£5.9bn) package of military assistance to Ukraine.

The aid, part of a $61bn package that passed Congress in April, will be approved through presidential drawdown authority and will pull from existing Pentagon supplies to deliver the arms more quickly.

Congressional Republicans blocked the package for months earlier this year, before ultimately relenting and passing the legislation. The delay caused arms supplies to Ukraine to dry up for several months.

Zelensky thanked the US - Ukraine's largest foreign donor.

At the same time, he also reportedly expressed frustration at the delay in delivering weapons that were already promised when he met US congressmen on Thursday morning.

Volodymyr Zelensky (left) and Joe Biden said they would focus on Ukraine's "victory plan" at their White House talks

Volodymyr Zelensky is meeting Joe Biden and Kamala Harris at the White House to discuss his "victory plan", which the Ukrainian president hopes will pressure Russia into agreeing a diplomatic end to the war.

Details have been kept secret, but Zelensky is likely to ask the US president and vice-president for continuing military and financial support, as well as security guarantees.

It comes amid a row with Donald Trump and the Republican party ahead of November's US presidential election.

They were angered by Zelensky's visit to an arms factory in Biden's hometown of Scranton with top Democrats. Zelensky will meet Trump on Friday despite earlier reports that the meeting had been cancelled.

Zelensky's visit to the ammunition factory in the key swing state of Pennsylvania was labelled by leading Republicans as a partisan campaign event.

In a public letter, speaker of the US House Mike Johnson said the visit was "designed to help Democrats" and claimed it amounted to "election interference".

He also demanded that Ukraine fire its ambassador to Washington who helped arrange the visit.

The Republican-led House Oversight Committee has also announced it would investigate whether Zelensky's trip was an attempt to use a foreign leader to benefit Harris's campaign.

Her Republican rival for the presidency, Donald Trump, mocked Zelensky at a campaign event as the "greatest salesman on Earth" and accused him of refusing to "make a deal" with Moscow.

Earlier this week, Trump also praised Russia's military capabilities, saying: "They beat Hitler, they beat Napoleon - that’s what they do, they fight."

The two men have long had a fractious relationship. In 2019, Trump was impeached by the US House over accusations that he pressured Ukraine's leader to dig up damaging information on a political rival.

The row clouded a week in which Zelensky has twice addressed the United Nations, ramping up efforts to persuade the US and other allies to boost support more than two and a half years into Russia's full-scale invasion.

At the White House meetings, Zelensky is expected to push again for US backing to fire Western-made long-range missiles deep into Russian territory, which Biden has so far blocked.

Before the meeting, Biden said: "Let me be clear, Russia will not prevail in war... Ukraine will prevail".

He also pledged to support Kyiv "in its path to membership to both the EU and Nato".

Meanwhile, Zelensky thanked the US for its "unwavering bipartisan support".

He later met Harris, with the vice-president reiterating her support for Ukraine and arguing the US must continue its role of global leadership.

With Russian troops advancing in the east of Ukraine, the outcome of Zelensky's meeting with Biden and Harris is seen by many experts as a key moment in his attempt to shore up US support before the November election.

On Wednesday, Russia's Vladimir Putin announced a plan to revise Moscow's nuclear doctrine, to enable Russia to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states if they are supported by nuclear states.

Putin's spokesperson later clarified that it was meant as a "specific signal" to the West.

President Volodymyr Zelensky visited the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant alongside top Democrats on Friday

Hours before his meeting with Zelensky, Biden announced a $7.9bn (£5.9bn) package of military assistance to Ukraine.

The aid, part of a $61bn package that passed Congress in April, will be approved through presidential drawdown authority and will pull from existing Pentagon supplies to deliver the arms more quickly.

Congressional Republicans blocked the package for months earlier this year, before ultimately relenting and passing the legislation. The delay caused arms supplies to Ukraine to dry up for several months.

Zelensky thanked the US - Ukraine's largest foreign donor.

At the same time, he also reportedly expressed frustration at the delay in delivering weapons that were already promised when he met US congressmen on Thursday morning.

WASHINGTON (AP) — House Speaker [Mike Johnson](https://apnews.com/hub/mike-johnson/)
 is calling on Ukrainian President [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://apnews.com/article/zelenskyy-ukraine-pennsylvania-ammunition-plant-c0e1fe5ebfa11ecfe92e842860e6440c)
 to fire his country’s ambassador to the U.S. as Republicans criticize Zelenskyy’s [visit to an ammunition plant](https://apnews.com/article/zelenskyy-ukraine-pennsylvania-ammunition-plant-c0e1fe5ebfa11ecfe92e842860e6440c)
 in Pennsylvania, a swing-state, as a political stunt.

The Republican speaker’s demand Wednesday came as Zelenskyy [addressed the United Nations](https://apnews.com/video/war-and-unrest-ukraine-government-ukraine-russia-government-russia-eae042530895412f9447f6c70f7f27c1)
 in New York on the eve of his visit Washington, where he has plans to brief lawmakers on Capitol Hill about the [war effort](https://apnews.com/hub/ukraine)
 before [meeting with President Joe Biden at the White House](https://apnews.com/article/zelenskyy-peace-plan-biden-russia-ukraine-d5e0d1aa9bf7d17e13609c2564d26489)
.

“The tour was clearly a partisan campaign event designed to help Democrats and is clearly election interference,” Johnson wrote in a letter to Zelenskyy.

Johnson, who is close to Republican presidential nominee [Donald Trump](https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump)
, said no Republicans were invited to the plant tour on Sunday, which he said was arranged by Ambassador Oksana Markarova.

An Army official said it was standard procedure to invite House and Senate members who represent the district where such industrial plants are located. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal discussions, said that in this case interested congressional members from the area attended.

Joining for the visit were the state’s Gov. Josh Shapiro, Sen. Bob Casey and the district’s Rep. Matt Cartwright, all Democrats. The plant is located in Scranton, Biden’s hometown.

The speaker’s stern demand for the swift removal of Markarova, a well-received diplomat in Washington who has been a fixture on Capitol Hill since the outset of the war — even sitting as a guest in the House visitor’s gallery during pivotal speeches — comes at a daunting time for Ukraine as Zelenskyy works to ensure U.S. support for the war effort in an election year.

While Biden and Democrats in Congress have largely stood with Ukraine since the Russian invasion in 2022, sending billions in U.S. aid to buy weaponry and support services, Republicans have split deeply. Trump has turned the GOP toward a new America First movement that generally prefers to limit U.S. involvement overseas, and he often speaks admirably of Russia and its president, Vladmir Putin.

Johnson said that support for ending Russia’s war against Ukraine “continues to be bipartisan, but our relationship is unnecessarily tested,” noting comments from the Ukrainian government about the top of the Trump-Vance presidential ticket.

Trump in his own speech Wednesday [lashed out at Zelenskyy](https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-ukraine-putin-zelenskyy-0f4d539aa73a943474d779716e5fe42a)
 and said the people of Ukraine are “dead” and the country itself “demolished,” raising fresh questions about the level of U.S. support the former president would provide to help Ukraine fight Russia if he returned to the White House.

Later Johnson, who said he won’t be meeting Thursday with Zelenskyy at the Capitol, said the ambassador “crossed the line” and the situation requires “immediate attention and action.”

Zelenskyy visited the [Scranton Army Ammunition Plant](https://apnews.com/article/us-army-ukraine-russia-ammunition-war-75a9ca2e3be09578c65f1198ba5b72e5)
 to thank the workers who are producing one of the [most critically needed munitions](https://apnews.com/article/us-army-ukraine-russia-ammunition-war-e753d12f76ad3974184fc6aa2ed5125b)
 for [his country’s fight](https://apnews.com/hub/ukraine)
 to fend off Russian ground forces.

The Scranton plant is one of the few facilities in the country to manufacture [155 mm artillery shells](https://apnews.com/article/155mm-howitzer-ukraine-ammunition-russia-7d966c85046b73db2b013f93c51af2a5)
 and has increased production over the past year. Ukraine has already received more than 3 million of them from the U.S.

“It is in places like this where you can truly feel that the democratic world can prevail,” Zelenskyy wrote on X.

“Thanks to people like these — in Ukraine, in America, and in all partner countries — who work tirelessly to ensure that life is protected.”

Zelenskyy is far from the first foreign leader to visit U.S. plants producing and selling arms to their country, in tours that did not incur Republican protests. The U.S.’s NATO partners in Europe increasingly have made a point of such visits to demonstrate the jobs and money that U.S. alliances bring home to Americans.

Zelenskyy also has met exclusively with Republicans on some past trips while in the U.S. In July, he [visited Utah](https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-volodymyr-zelenskyy-governors-c777901001422bbc5e0885a1824a67c9)
 to speak at the National Governor’s Association and was welcomed by the state’s Republican Gov. Spencer Cox, the group’s outgoing chairman. During the visit Zelenskyy also met with Utah’s congressional delegation, all Republicans.

The Scranton visit sparked swift reprisals from the Republicans.

Rep. James Comer, the Republican chairman of the House Oversight Committee, announced Wednesday he was opening an investigation into whether the Biden-Harris administration used taxpayer-funded resources to fly Zelenskyy to Pennsylvania as a campaign event for Vice President Kamala Harris, who is the Democratic nominee for president.

“The Committee seeks to determine whether the Biden-Harris Administration attempted to use a foreign leader to benefit Vice President Harris’s presidential campaign and, if so, necessarily committed an abuse of power,” he wrote in letters to Biden, the White House counsel and others in the administration.

The Pentagon said the flight was funded by the Defense Department for senior officials from the departments of Defense and State “conducting official business related to U.S. security assistance to Ukraine.” The flight stopped at Newark Liberty International Airport, “where they linked up with President Zelensky before continuing to Wilkes-Barre International Airport in Pennsylvania,” the Pentagon said.

Senate Republicans, even those who had supported aid for Ukraine, roundly criticized Zelenskyy on Wednesday. “He really messed up,” said Sen. Markwayne Mullin, an Oklahoma Republican.

However, Sen. Roger Wicker, the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee and a firm backer of Ukraine, suggested that Zelenskyy’s visit was not as partisan as it appeared. Wicker was planning to meet with the Ukrainian president at the Capitol on Thursday.

“If President Zelenskyy came to Mississippi, he would be accompanied by Republican officials because that’s who the people in their wisdom elected,” he said.

### **CLAIM**

Posts claimed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed artillery shells destined to be dropped on Gaza during a visit to a Pennsylvania munitions factory.

* * *

### **BACKGROUND**

A video and still images shared online were described as showing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing artillery shells destined for use in Gaza by Israel.

One [version](https://x.com/firasshams1/status/1896565304148574479)
 of video was circulated online at the beginning of March with the caption: “For those feeling sorry for Volodymyr Zelensky, here’s the Ukrainian President signing bombs to be dropped on innocent Gazans”. Zelensky signing bombs that killed Palestinian women and children”.

* * *

### **METHOD**

The video of Zelenskyy and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro signing artillery shells began to circulate online following an eventful meeting at the White House between Zelenskyy, President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance on February 28 which turned into a near-shouting match.

Video caption falsely claims Zelenskyy signed bombs for Gaza
============================================================

### The video actually shows him at a U.S. Available at: [Zelensky signing bombs that killed Palestinian women and children](https://x.com/Abdella07967637/status/1896372053160366410)
 \[Accessed 13 Mar. During the meeting, Trump told Zelenskyy to make a deal with Russia to end the war in Ukraine. He also told Zelenskyy he was “[gambling with World War III](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/28/trump-vance-zelenskyy-oval-office-exchange-00206727)
”.

A reverse Google Image search of a screen shot from the video however revealed that it was published several months before the fateful White House meeting.

Governor Josh Shapiro shared the video on September 23, 2024, with a caption referencing Ukraine’s war with Russia. This version allowed us to see that Zelenskyy wrote “Glory to Ukraine” on one shell and “Thanks for Support” on another, both referencing Ukraine’s war with Russia and not Israel’s war in Gaza.

[Information](https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/prezident-vidvidav-skrentonskij-armijskij-boyepripasnij-zavo-93389)
 about Zelenskyy’s visit to the ammunition factory, as well as details on its operations, was provided on Ukraine’s official government website.

“The plant’s capacity is fully dedicated to meeting Ukraine’s needs, particularly for the production of 155mm shells, which has significantly increased over the past year,” the statement read.

A statement regarding the visit was also released on the U.S. Army [website](https://www.army.mil/article/279911/ukrainian_president_zelenskyy_tours_scranton_army_ammunition_plant)
 which confirmed the factory was being used to bolster Ukraine’s ammunition stockpile.

* * *

### **RATING**

The video shows Zelenskyy visiting a munitions factory that produces armaments for the Ukrainian Security and Defense Forces, not Israel. It was published five months before the February 2025 meeting and a longer version of the video reveals that Zelenskyy’s handwritten messages do not reference Ukraine’s war with Russia or Israel’s war in Gaza.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy provides an update on the war in Ukraine to Fox News anchor Bret Baier on 'Special Report.'

NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles!

Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Tim Walz to be Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate, posted a video of him signing the missile at the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant (SCAAP), in President Biden’s hometown.

"We must all do our part in the fight for freedom – from the workers in Scranton who make Pennsylvania the arsenal of democracy to the brave Ukrainian soldiers protecting their country," Shapiro captioned his video.

"We stand with Ukraine in their just defense of their homeland in the face of Russian aggression."

However, response from the right was brisk – with conservative commentator David Harris Jr. (AP Photo)

Other critics contrasted the autograph [with Shapiro’s](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pennsylvania-governor-democratic-attorney-general-josh-shapiro-defeats-gop-challenger-doug-mastriano)
 criticisms of former President Trump.

"Zelenskyy just essentially endorsed Kamala in Pennsylvania while with Josh Shapiro autographing ammunition," wrote Philadelphia commentator Joey Mannarino on X.

"He called Trump and Vance ‘radical’. – locked in a tight re-election race with businessman David McCormick – was seen shaking hands with Zelenskyy as Shapiro wrote a message on the missile.

Other critics pointed out that chaos was erupting elsewhere in the commonwealth while Shapiro, Zelenskyy and Casey were touring the ordnance plant.

Pennsylvania Gov. (Charles Creitz)

In an official statement, Shapiro said Pennsylvania is the "birthplace of American freedom" and Pennsylvanians therefore stand with Ukrainians in their fight against "naked aggression."

He also noted Pennsylvania will sign an agreement with the Ukrainian state of Zaporizhizhia that will "foster collaboration for years to come."

In regard to the agreement, Pennsylvania Secretary of Community & Economic Development Rick Siger [told WHTM](https://www.abc27.com/pennsylvania/shapiro-zelenskyy-sign-agreement-establishing-partnership-between-pennsylvania-ukrainian-province/)
 that the pact will "help support the future economic revitalization of Ukraine, while boosting our economy and creating jobs for Pennsylvanians."

Zelenskyy's "Glory to Ukraine" inscription on US bombs in Pennsylvania stirs controversy
========================================================================================

15 October 2024 18:57

**Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's recent visit to Pennsylvania has stirred significant controversy, raising questions about the intersection of foreign diplomacy and US electoral politics.**

** reports, **[citing](https://www.politico.eu/article/polish-american-lean-donald-trump-despite-ukraine-war-dupont-pennsylvania/)** Politico.

While at the plant, Zelenskyy inscribed messages of gratitude on US bombs, including the phrase “Glory to Ukraine.” Democratic Governor Josh Shapiro, who was present during the signing, appeared supportive of the gesture. “Because you’re signing bombs that could potentially kill innocent people.

50 days for peace: Will Moscow accept Trump's terms? There’s innocent on both sides.”

The backlash against Zelenskyy’s visit was further amplified by political commentators and Republican leaders. Reports indicate that Zelenskyy’s remarks about the Republican candidate for US vice president, whom he labeled as radical, only fueled this perception.

Senator Lindsey Graham, a prominent Republican figure, also condemned Zelenskyy's presence at the military plant, asserting that such actions could jeopardize Ukraine’s long-term objectives in its fight against Russia. “We need to ensure that incidents like this do not detract from the long-term goals of ensuring success for Ukraine,” Graham remarked.

Content: "JINSA October Missile Attack Proves Costly for Iranian Regime 3 » Assuming Iran fired 180 missiles and used similar missile variants in the attack, Israel’s figures demonstrate that Iran’s medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs) cost the regime at least $12 million apiece—far costlier than previous public estimates. JINSA October Missile Attack Proves Costly for Iranian Regime 1 NatSec Brief: December 6, 2024 October Missile Attack Proves Costly for Iranian Regime Ari Cicurel Assistant Director of Foreign Policy Yoni Tobin Policy Analyst Iran has threatened another strike against Israel in recent days. Iran’s October 1 ballistic missile attack cost the regime around $2.3 billion, at least four and six times the estimated cost (and at least 124 and 42 times more in terms of GDP per capita) for the United States and Israel, respectively, to defend against it. According to a Tasnim sum- mary of his remarks, Larijani said, “relevant officials \[in Iran’s\] military and government are preparing measures to show \[a\] proper response to recent Israeli aggression against Iran.” » Iran’s previous direct attack against Israel—its October 1 missile strike—inflicted minimal damage despite Iran launching approximately 180 ballistic missiles into Israeli airspace. That changed with Iran’s October 1 missile attack against Israel, which cost Tehran relatively more to execute than it cost Israel and the United States to defend against, while yielding minimal tactical or strategic success for the regime. ⚫ On November 12, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that Iran’s October 1 missile attack cost the Iranian regime $2.3 billion. Costs of October 1 Missile Attack Israel United States Iran Low-End Estimated Cost of Missile Attack $360,000,000 $116,400,000 $2,300,000,000 (Number provided by Israel) High-End Estimated Cost of Missile Attack $630,000,000 $334,000,000 GDP Per Capita (2023 est.) World Bank Figures $52,260 $81,695 $4,502 ⚫ Given that around 180 missiles entered Israeli airspace in the attack, the maximum conceiv- able cost for Israel to defend against Iran’s October 1 attack—assuming a ratio of one inter- ceptor fired per inbound missile—was significant but smaller than Iran’s: between $360 mil- lion and $630 million, according to JINSA estimates. » Israel’s wide-ranging October 26 kinetic response reportedly involved some 100 aircraft, targeted over 20 sites, took out key elements of Iran’s ballistic missile program—includ- ing planetary mixers used to make solid fuel for MRBMs—and neutralized Iran’s primary air defenses, leaving Iran’s core assets vulnerable to future strikes. Iran’s attack also incurred a strong Israeli re- sponse that knocked out the regime’s main air defenses and elements of its ballistic missile and nuclear programs. JINSA October Missile Attack Proves Costly for Iranian Regime 2 In addition, the attack proved costly in tactical terms for Iran, yielding serious IDF blowback that compromised key elements of the regime’s nuclear programs and ballistic missile pro- duction programs, and took out the regime’s top air defenses."

Israel’s air-defense system passes test in fending off Iranian missile strike
=============================================================================

[World](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world)
 Oct 2, 2024 1:49 PM EDT

JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel’s multilayered air-defense system appears to have passed another test after fending off Iran’s latest missile barrage.

In Tuesday’s night’s strike, Iran fired over 180 missiles toward Israel. According to Israeli media reports, the cost of a single Iron Dome interception is about $50,000, while the other systems can run more than $2 million per missile. It has been deployed on multiple occasions throughout the war.

### Iron Dome

This system, developed by Israel with U.S. Israel says it has a success rate of over 90%.

### Iron Beam

Israel is developing a new system to intercept incoming threats with laser technology. They have ranged from short-range rockets to medium-range missiles to attack drones to long-range ballistic missiles like those fired Tuesday night.

In Tuesday’s attack, the U.S. Explosions also were seen over the skies of Jordan, though it remains unclear who carried out the interceptions.

But the vast majority of Israel’s air defense over the past year has been carried out by Israel itself. Israeli leaders say the system isn’t 100% guaranteed, but credit it with preventing serious damage and countless casualties.

Here’s a closer look at Israel’s multilayered air-defense system:

### The Arrow

This system developed with the U.S. is designed to intercept long-range missiles, including the types of ballistic missiles Iran launched on Tuesday."

# Instructions
In order to find evidence that helps your fact-check, you just ran a web search which yielded a Search Result. **Your task right now is to summarize the Search Result.** What to include:
* information that might be useful for the fact-check (see Record)
* relevant images (refer to images by inserting their reference <image:k>)
* if available: the release date as well as the author or the publisher (e.g. the media company) of the search result.

Do NOT include:
* advertisements
* any other information not related to the Record or the Claim

Additional rules:
* Do not add any additional information besides the information in the Search Result.
* If the Search Result doesn't contain any relevant information for the fact-checking work, simply print one word in capital letters: "NONE".
* Keep your writing style like in the Examples 1, 2 and 3 provided to you.
* Try to filter out relevant information even if the search result is in a different language.

# Example 1
The search result from America Today provides several photographs of the Notre-Dame Cathedral fire on April 15, 2019. <image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>. None of the images show the Eiffel Tower in the background. 

# Example 2
NONE

# Example 3
The Guardian discusses a report blaming the Syrian government for a toxic gas attack and condemning their use of chemical weapons. The Guardian mentions the Chemical Weapons Convention and the responsibilities of Syria under the convention. According to The Guardian, The White House condemned the Assad regime for defying the norm against chemical weapons use.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "The Iron Dome intercepted 90% of ballistic missiles fired at Israel in Iran's attack on October 1, 2024."

## Actions
```
web_search("Iron Dome Israel ballistic missile interception rate October 1 2024 Iran attack")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results include an article from jpost.com discussing technological lessons learned from the Iran war, published on July 20, 2025 (<image:1>). Another source, a Wikipedia article, mentions that Iran launched over 120 ballistic missiles at Israel on October 1, 2024, and Israel's defensive efforts destroyed 99 percent of the incoming weapons.

A report from JINSA, published on December 6, 2024, states that Iran launched approximately 180 ballistic missiles at Israel on October 1, resulting in minimal damage. The report estimates the cost of the attack to Iran at $2.3 billion.

*   [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2024_Iranian_strikes_on_Israel)
*   [Source](https://jinsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/October-Missile-Attack-Proves-Costly-for-Iranian-Regime-1.pdf)


## Elaboration
The evidence provides conflicting information regarding the interception rate of ballistic missiles. The Wikipedia article states that 99% of the incoming weapons were destroyed, while the jpost.com article does not specify an interception rate. Therefore, the claim that the Iron Dome intercepted 90% of the missiles cannot be verified with the provided evidence.


## Actions

Iranian missile strikes show Israel’s aerial defense array is not ironclad

Iranian missile strikes show Israel’s aerial defense array is not ironclad
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

1 of 3 | 

Air raid sirens sounded across Israel on Friday night as Iranian missiles were launched towards the country. assistance, has developed a tiered system capable of detecting incoming fire and deploying only if the projectile is headed toward a population center or sensitive military or civilian infrastructure while letting other projectiles land in open spaces.

The array can shoot down short-range rockets to medium-range missiles to attack drones to ballistic missiles like those Iran has been firing.

But the military warns the system is not fool proof and while interception rates are generally high, enemy missiles can penetrate. Israel has said this system will be a game changer because it would be much cheaper to operate than existing systems.

According to Israeli media reports, the cost of a single Iron Dome interception is about $50,000, while the other systems can run more than $2 million per missile. Supreme Court](https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court)

# Instructions
You just retrieved web sources, each one summarized under "Web Sources". **Your task right now is to summarize the web source summaries.**

Always adhere to the following rules:
* Write only one to two paragraphs.
* Include all URLs from the listed sources. Format them as Markdown hyperlinks.
* Do not add any additional information besides the information in the summaries.
* Include references (<image:k>) to all relevant images.

## Claim
Claim: "The Iron Dome intercepted 90% of ballistic missiles fired at Israel in Iran's attack on October 1, 2024."

## Actions
```
web_search("Iron Dome Israel ballistic missile interception rate October 1 2024 Iran attack")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results include an article from jpost.com discussing technological lessons learned from the Iran war, published on July 20, 2025 (<image:1>). Another source, a Wikipedia article, mentions that Iran launched over 120 ballistic missiles at Israel on October 1, 2024, and Israel's defensive efforts destroyed 99 percent of the incoming weapons.

A report from JINSA, published on December 6, 2024, states that Iran launched approximately 180 ballistic missiles at Israel on October 1, resulting in minimal damage. The report estimates the cost of the attack to Iran at $2.3 billion.

## Elaboration
The evidence provides conflicting information regarding the interception rate of ballistic missiles. The Wikipedia article states that 99% of the incoming weapons were destroyed, while the jpost.com article does not specify an interception rate. Therefore, the claim that the Iron Dome intercepted 90% of the missiles cannot be verified with the provided evidence.

An Israeli tank moves a long the border with the Gaza Strip on January 1, 2025 in Southern Israel, Israel. One user wrote, “The Merkava tank is the most famous Israeli military industry. In Gaza, they made it into a Gazan fruit and vegetable stall. It also identifies the location as Homs, not Damascus.

“The army left a tank… for almost three days, I brought the goods, but no one saw the shop,” Youssef says in the video.

Furthermore, the tank is a [T-54/55](https://odin.tradoc.army.mil/WEG/Asset/T-54_Russian_Main_Battle_Tank_(MBT)
), not a Merkava tank. A Merkava tank has a [flatter turret](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkava)
 than the Soviet-era tank, which was [widely used](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_equipment_of_the_Syrian_Army)
 by the Syrian Arab Army.

### Second Intifada

In February 2002, a Merkava III was destroyed by a roadside bomb near [Netzarim](/wiki/Netzarim "Netzarim")
 in the Gaza Strip. The IDF wanted to increase orders of new Merkava Mark 4 tanks, and planned to add the [Trophy active defense system](/wiki/Trophy_(countermeasure) "Trophy (countermeasure)")
 to Merkava Mark 4 tanks, and to increase joint training between crews and Israeli [anti-tank](/wiki/Anti-tank_warfare "Anti-tank warfare")
 soldiers.[\[58\]](#cite_note-58)
[\[59\]](#cite_note-59)

### Operation Cast Lead

Main article: [Operation Cast Lead](/wiki/Operation_Cast_Lead "Operation Cast Lead")

The Merkava Mark IV was used more extensively during the [Gaza War](/wiki/Gaza_War_(2008%E2%80%932009) "Gaza War (2008–2009)")
, as it had been received by the IDF in increasing numbers since 2006, replacing more of the Merkava II and III versions of the tank that were in service. The Trophy protective system has been used by the IDF since 2011.

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Flickr_-_Israel_Defense_Forces_-_Storming_Ahead.jpg/250px-Flickr_-_Israel_Defense_Forces_-_Storming_Ahead.jpg)](/wiki/File:Flickr_-_Israel_Defense_Forces_-_Storming_Ahead.jpg)

Merkava IV equipped with the [Trophy](/wiki/Trophy_(countermeasure) "Trophy (countermeasure)")
 active defense system.

By October 2010, the IDF had begun to equip the first Merkava Mark IVs with the Trophy active protection system, to improve the tanks' protection against advanced anti-tank missiles which use [tandem-charge](/wiki/Tandem-charge "Tandem-charge")
 HEAT warheads.[\[62\]](#cite_note-62)
[\[63\]](#cite_note-weiss-63)
 Added protection systems included an Elbit laser-warning system and IMI in-built smoke-screen grenades.[\[29\]](#cite_note-Merkava_Mk_IV_breaks_cover-29)

In December 2010, [Hamas](/wiki/Hamas "Hamas")
 fired an [AT-14 Kornet](/wiki/AT-14_Kornet "AT-14 Kornet")
 anti-tank missile at a Merkava Mark 3 tank stationed on the Israel-Gaza border near Al-[Bureij](/wiki/Bureij "Bureij")
. As a result of the attack, Israel decided to deploy its first Merkava Mark 4 battalion equipped with the Trophy system along the Gaza border.[\[64\]](#cite_note-64)

On March 1, 2011, a Merkava Mark IV stationed near the Gaza border, equipped with the Trophy active protection system, successfully foiled a missile attack against it, marking the system's first operational success.[\[65\]](#cite_note-65)

### Operation Protective Edge 2014

Main article: [Operation Protective Edge](/wiki/Operation_Protective_Edge "Operation Protective Edge")

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/Merkava4m-Windbreaker-0036a.jpg/250px-Merkava4m-Windbreaker-0036a.jpg)](/wiki/File:Merkava4m-Windbreaker-0036a.jpg)

Merkava Mk 4M Windbreaker, fitted with [Trophy](/wiki/Trophy_(countermeasure) "Trophy (countermeasure)")
 [active protection system](/wiki/Active_protection_system "Active protection system")
, during [Operation Protective Edge](/wiki/2014_Israel%E2%80%93Gaza_conflict "2014 Israel–Gaza conflict")

No tanks were damaged during Operation Protective Edge. _(May 2024)_ _([Learn how and when to remove this message](/wiki/Help:Maintenance_template_removal "Help:Maintenance template removal")<br>)_ |

Some Merkava tanks are fitted with full medical and ambulance abilities while retaining their armament (but carrying less ammunition than the standard tank, having both ammunition racks in the rear removed). The Loader Keyboard Panel (LKP) includes breech block closing switch, fire and local activation of the trays.

The main operational roles are: firing from internal storage; firing for elevator – ground-piled ammunition; loading from elevator – external pile; synthesising fire programs; unloading; manual firing; identification; and fusing and checks.

Standard equipment includes an NBC system of the overpressure type and an inertial navigation and aiming system designed for autonomous operations.

According to Soltam Systems, the 155 mm/52 caliber ordnance and automatic loader, or parts of the system, could be installed in other self-propelled artillery systems and used to upgrade other self-propelled systems such as the US-designed and built 155 mm [M109](/wiki/M109_howitzer "M109 howitzer")
 and [M44](/wiki/M44_self_propelled_howitzer "M44 self propelled howitzer")
.

Successor (Carmel)
------------------

On July 14, 2011, _[The Jerusalem Post](/wiki/The_Jerusalem_Post "The Jerusalem Post")
_ reported that the IDF had begun developing a successor for the Merkava series of tanks. With the system's ability to intercept threats at a stand-off distance, there was a review of the need for vehicles like the Merkava to have thick, heavy layers of armor.[\[82\]](#cite_note-82)

The Merkava Tank Planning Directorate set up a team to study principles for a future tank and present ideas for an armored fighting vehicle to provide mobile firepower on a future battlefield. [Jump to content](#bodyContent)

Hamas's anti-tank flyer.

Via social media

Hamas terrorists think they know how to knock out the Israeli army’s main tank, the 70-ton Merkava Mark IV.

Aim for the rear hatch and ammunition-stowage, the space between the turret and hull, the tank’s belly or a supposed weak spot in the armor on the side of the hull near the front. The ammo storage, turret ring and belly are weak spots on virtually _all_ tanks.

What’s more surprising is Hamas’ tips for defeating the Trophy active protective systems that are new features on some of the Israeli army’s roughly 400 front-line Merkava Mark IVs. Alternatively, an SPG-9 recoilless gun should defeat a Trophy-equipped tank, simply by virtue of its projectile’s high speed.

There is some evidence of Hamas militants damaging a Merkava with an PG-7T rocket on Oct. It’s possible the terrorists dutifully followed the flyer’s advice; it’s _also_ possible they defeated the tank’s Trophy by firing several rounds in quick succession—and overwhelming the device.

In any event, it wasn’t RPG teams who claimed the most Merkavas on Oct. Hamas’ small drones [struck at least two](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2023/10/12/israels-merkava-mark-iv-tanks-are-more-drone-proof-than-other-tanks-are/?sh=172138352114 "https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2023/10/12/israels-merkava-mark-iv-tanks-are-more-drone-proof-than-other-tanks-are/?sh=172138352114")
 of the heavily-armed, thickly-armored tanks. Another hit a Merkava on the turret bustle, which holds spare 120-millimeter cannon rounds for the four-person crew.

And the militants also _captured_ a Merkava—[along with more than a dozen superheavy armored personnel carriers](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2023/10/12/israel-converted-captured-arab-t-55-tanks-into-heavy-personnel-carriers-hamas-just-captured-a-tenth-of-them/?sh=60c212994a84 "https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2023/10/12/israel-converted-captured-arab-t-55-tanks-into-heavy-personnel-carriers-hamas-just-captured-a-tenth-of-them/?sh=60c212994a84")
—at an Israeli army base in Nakhal Oz. The terrorists abducted hundreds more people in settlements near the Israeli wall surrounding Gaza.

The Israelis retrieved at least one of the flyers, apparently from a dead Hamas fighter, and posted photos on social media.

The flyer’s contents should come as no surprise to experienced soldiers. One aimed its payload at the thin armor protecting the tank’s engine in its forward hull. You don’t need help from a flyer when a tank is crewless and idle.

In Syria, an abandoned tank has become a fruit and vegetable stand.
===================================================================

!In Syria, an abandoned tank has become a fruit and vegetable stand. <image:2101>

15.12.2024 20:50

In Syria, a tank abandoned by regime forces became a fruit and vegetable stand.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On November 27, clashes intensified between regime-opposing armed groups and Bashar al-Assad's forces in Syria. The groups had gained dominance in the largest provinces such as Aleppo, Idlib, Hama, and Homs between November 30 and December 7. As the groups began to enter the capital Damascus on December 7, with support from the masses, the regime completely lost control in Damascus and many other regions, leading to its collapse. The 61-year rule of the Ba'ath Party came to an end, and regime leader Assad fled the capital.

### OPERATION DAWN OF FREEDOM

Meanwhile, the Syrian National Army had liberated the center of the Tel Rifaat district from the terrorist organization PKK/YPG on the first day of the Operation Dawn of Freedom, which was launched in December. With the liberation of the Manbij district during the operation, the region, which had turned into the largest terrorist stronghold west of the Euphrates River, was cleared of PKK/YPG.

Oct. 30, 2023, 2:03 PM EDT

By [Mithil Aggarwal](https://www.nbcnews.com/author/mithil-aggarwal-ncpn1288084)

A car was fired upon by what appeared to be an Israeli tank on the outskirts of [Gaza City](https://www.nbcnews.com/video/video-shows-convoy-of-u-n-vehicles-leaving-gaza-city-195115077802)
, an eyewitness told NBC News on Monday, as the major ground offensive in the Palestinian enclave drew more international calls for civilians to be protected.

Freelance photographer Bashar Talib said he was traveling in a nearby vehicle on the Salah Al Deen road when the vehicle was hit.

The driver of the white car saw the tank “at the last minute,” he said. “He was close to the tank and the bulldozer. He stopped his car to go back, but he was targeted before driving,” Talib added. 

[**_Follow live updates on the Israel-Hamas conflict_**](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/israel-hamas-war-live-updates-rcna123108)

Video shot by his colleague Youssef Al-Saifi, a local journalist, who was traveling with him, shows a white car moving ahead of them down the road. As their vehicle slows down, the white car slows down and starts to turn around.

Just as it starts to drive away in the opposite direction, the tank then fires a round that hits its back end and black smoke erupts. 

The vehicle carrying Talib and Al-Saifi then turns around and drives away quickly. “The man is dead, a whole family,” they scream as it speeds up. 

NBC News could not independently verify that a family was in the white car. 

Asked about the incident by NBC News, the IDF said it would not comment on the positions of its forces inside Gaza. But IDF Maj. Nir Dinar told [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/israel-hamas-gaza-war-latest/card/witness-describes-seeing-israeli-tank-fire-on-taxi-southeast-of-gaza-city-MxFhMYxmv3QxQXpGcpHk)
 that “terrorists use civilian infrastructure like cars. They don’t have tanks or military jeeps.”

Driving in the opposite direction, Talib said they passed “a bus filled with civilians and children” moving straight toward the white car and the tank. 

Although they shouted for it to “go back,” he said the driver did not hear them because he was traveling too quickly. 

The incident took place hours after Israel’s military said it had struck more than 600 militant targets over the past few days as it expanded ground operations in the Gaza Strip. 

Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari told a news conference that the IDF would “continue and intensify” its ground operation and “additional forces” had entered the besieged enclave over the last day. Some of them had fought with “terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings,” he said.    

Meanwhile, as the war enters its fourth week, aid agencies are warning that Palestinian civilians are in dire need of fuel, food and clean water as Gaza’s infrastructure has reached a point of near collapse. On Saturday, crowds of people broke into four U.N. facilities and took food supplies. The United Nations said this was a sign that civil order was starting to break down. 

With no central power for weeks and little fuel, hospitals are struggling to keep emergency generators running to operate incubators and other lifesaving equipment. 

A spokesperson for the Palestine Red Crescent Society said Monday that blasts had rung out less than 200 feet from the Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City, which is sheltering thousands of people. 

Strikes hit near Gaza City’s Shifa and Al-Quds hospitals and the Indonesian and Turkish hospitals in northern Gaza in recent days, the U.N. said.

After Talib and Al-Saifi shared their video of the tank blasting the car, it was posted by the Palestinian foreign ministry, which described its passengers as martyrs.

Talib, meanwhile, said he was grateful to be alive.  

“God spared our lives,” he said. “If there was no car driving in front of us, we would be targeted.”

Penny Wong urges Israel to end Rafah offensive as Israeli forces reportedly reach city's centre

Israel has pounded Rafah with air strikes and tank fire, pressing its offensive in the southern Gaza city despite international condemnation of an attack that sparked a blaze in a tent camp for the displaced, [killing at least 45 people](/news/2024-05-27/israel-military-prosecutor-says-rafah-strike-under-investigation/103899588)
.

Reacting to Sunday night's strike and fire in a camp where thousands of displaced families from elsewhere in the Gaza Strip had sought shelter, global leaders urged the implementation of a World Court order to halt Israel's assault.

Israeli military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said on Tuesday the military had fired two 17-kilogram munitions in the strike that targeted two senior Hamas militants.

He said the munitions would have been too small to ignite a fire on their own, and the army was looking into the possibility that weapons were stored in the area.

Foreign Minister Penny Wong said the air strikes on Rafah showed why an immediate humanitarian ceasefire was needed.

She said Australia had been very clear that Israel must not proceed with its operation there.

"The death and destruction in Rafah is horrific. This human suffering is unacceptable," Senator Wong said, speaking at Senate estimates on Tuesday.

"We reiterate to the government of Israel: This cannot continue.

"We must see an immediate humanitarian ceasefire so civilians can be protected and Australia continues to support the work of the United States, Qatar and Egypt to that end.

"We continue to call for the release of all hostages by Hamas and for Israel to allow aid to flow at scale, as directed by the International Court of Justice."

Several Israeli tanks on Tuesday reached the centre of Rafah, witnesses told Reuters, three weeks into a ground operation in the southern Gaza Strip city that has has drawn intense scrutiny from neighbouring Egypt and from the United States.

The tanks were spotted near Al-Awda mosque, a central Rafah landmark, the witnesses said. The Israeli military did not immediately comment on their account, saying it would issue a statement about the Rafah operation later.

At least 16 Palestinians were killed in strikes overnight on Tuesday, officials in the enclave run by Hamas militants said. Israeli tanks pushed towards western neighbourhoods in one of the worst nights of bombardment reported by residents to news agency Reuters.

Before the latest advancement, Israeli tanks had probed around the edges of Rafah, near the crossing point from Gaza into Egypt, and entered some of its eastern districts, residents said, but had not yet entered the city in full force.

Residents said Israeli tanks were stationed on and around the Zurub hilltop, a high ground overlooking western Rafah, having advanced from the area near the Egyptian border crossing where Israeli forces launched an incursion three weeks ago.

They said the Tel Al-Sultan area, the scene of Sunday's deadly strike, was still being heavily bombarded.

"Tank shells are falling everywhere in Tel Al-Sultan. Many families have fled their houses in western Rafah under fire throughout the night," one resident told Reuters over a chat app.

One million have fled Rafah in past three weeks, UNRWA says
-----------------------------------------------------------

Around one million people have fled the Israeli offensive in Rafah since early May, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) said on Tuesday.

Israel has kept up attacks despite [a ruling by the top UN court](/news/2024-05-24/un-top-court-orders-israel-to-half-rafah-offensive/103892078)
 on Friday ordering it to stop, arguing the court's ruling grants it some scope for military action there.

More than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive, according to Gaza's health ministry.

Israel launched the operation after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on October 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.

Israel says it wants to root out Hamas fighters holed up in Rafah and rescue hostages it says are being held in the area.

In Jabalia in the northern Gaza Strip, one of the largest of the enclave's eight historic refugee camps, Israeli forces have been engaged in fierce fighting with Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters, residents said.

On Tuesday, medics said an Israeli air strike killed and wounded several Palestinians in a house in the Falouja neighbourhood. Civil emergency teams said they believed many bodies were under the rubble of buildings where they can't be reached.

Spain, Norway, Ireland recognise Palestinian state

Spain, Ireland and Norway officially recognised a Palestinian state on Tuesday, despite an angry reaction from Israel, which has found itself increasingly isolated after more than seven months of conflict in Gaza.

Madrid, Dublin and Oslo said they sought to accelerate efforts to secure a ceasefire and hoped their decision would spur other European Union countries to follow suit.

"It's the only way of advancing toward what everyone recognises as the only possible solution to achieve a peaceful future, one of a Palestinian state that lives side by side with the Israeli state in peace and security," Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said in a televised address.

Spain was recognising a unified Palestinian state, including the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, under the Palestinian National Authority with East Jerusalem as its capital, he said.

The Palestinian Authority, which exercises limited self-rule in the West Bank under Israeli military occupation, has welcomed the decision.

Ireland's Department of Foreign Affairs said last week it would upgrade its representative office in Ramallah in the West Bank to an embassy and appoint an ambassador and upgrade the status of the Palestinian mission in Ireland to an embassy.

Norway had until recently followed the position of the United States, which insists that a two-state solution can only be achieved through dialogue, but lost confidence that this strategy would work.

"In the middle of a war, with tens of thousands of dead and injured, we must keep alive the only thing that can provide a safe home for both Israelis and Palestinians: two states that can live in peace with each other," Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre said last week.

Israel has repeatedly condemned the move and said it bolsters Hamas.

"Sanchez, when you … recognise a Palestinian state, you are complicit in incitement to genocide against the Jewish people and in war crimes," Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz wrote on X on Tuesday.

Denmark's parliament on Tuesday voted down a bill to recognise a Palestinian state, after the Danish foreign minister previously said the necessary preconditions for an independent country were lacking.

Young Russians may be more likely than their elders to give Israel the benefit of the doubt in its conflict with Hamas.

Introduction
------------

Unlike most Western and Western-aligned countries, Israel refused to [sanction or cut ties](https://carnegieendowment.org/russia-eurasia/politika/2023/11/israel-and-russia-the-end-of-a-friendship?lang=en)
 with Russia after it invaded Ukraine in 2022 and has since [maintained its neutrality](https://www.cfr.org/article/why-israel-has-been-slow-support-ukraine)
 in the conflict. At the time, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Russian President Vladimir Putin had a [close personal relationship](https://carnegieendowment.org/russia-eurasia/politika/2023/11/israel-and-russia-the-end-of-a-friendship?lang=en)
 that had sustained warm relations between their countries for over a decade. However, their relationship cooled in 2023, as Russia and Iran began to develop a [major bilateral agreement](https://www.iranintl.com/en/202501046766)
 to expand their military, economic, and political cooperation that was [signed just last week](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/17/russia-and-iran-presidents-sign-partnership-treaty-in-moscow)
.

Relations between Israel and Russia further deteriorated in the aftermath of Hamas’ October 7, 2023, attack against Israel. Putin refused to designate the group as a terrorist organization and instead invited a delegation from Hamas to Moscow for peace talks, calling for a [two-state solution](https://www.reuters.com/world/putin-tells-abbas-great-pain-palestinian-plight-2024-08-13/)
 to the longstanding conflict.

Data from a joint Chicago Council on Global Affairs and Levada Analytical Center survey, fielded September 26-October 2, 2024, finds that most Russians share Putin’s view of the conflict and believe Israeli military operations in Gaza are unjustified. However, the data reveal some differences in attitudes toward the war between young Russians and those from older generations.

Young Russians are Less Critical of Israeli Military Operations in Gaza
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Despite the Kremlin’s diplomatic support for the Palestinian people, most Russians do not side with either party in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict (57%). However, among those who do choose a side, more side with Palestinians (28%) than with Israelis (6%). Young Russians are more likely to say they want to remain neutral in the conflict than older generations, who, by comparison, are less likely to be impartial and much more likely to side with Palestinians. Less than two in 10 Russians between 18-34 (14%) place themselves on the side of Palestinians, compared to four in 10 of the oldest cohort (40%).

Russian youth also have different opinions on Israel’s military operations in Gaza since the October 7, 2023, attack. Most Russians (59%) believe Israel has gone too far and its military actions are not justified, but young Russians are the least likely to say so (45%). In fact, they are nearly 30 percentage points less likely to say Israel has gone too far than the oldest cohort of Russians (70%). By contrast, they are the age group most likely to say Israel is justified and defending its interests (22%) or decline to answer the question entirely (33%).

…. and View Israel and the United States More Favorably
-------------------------------------------------------

As the United States’ closest ally in the Middle East, Israel is likely perceived by Russians as being aligned with the West and is, as a result, viewed unfavorably by much of the population. Half of Russians express a negative view of Israel (51%), while less than a third (27%) say they feel very or somewhat good about the country.

Young Russians are divided in their views of Israel, as nearly as many express a negative opinion (37%) as express a positive one (42%). However, they are much more likely than older Russians—majorities of whom express a negative view—to say they feel positively about Israel.

In the same vein, Russian youth are more likely to think Israel plays a positive role in resolving the key challenges facing the Middle East (23%) than other age groups, though nearly half (48%) contend that the country plays a negative role in the region. On this they differ from most Russians overall, who believe Israel plays a negative role in resolving regional challenges (60%), second only to the United States (71% negative role), which is viewed the most negatively. On the other hand, the majority of Russians (82%) believe their own country plays the most positive role in the region, followed by Iran (43%).

Russian youth also place less blame on the United States or Israel for the continued bloodshed and instability faced by the Middle East than do older Russians. Young Russians are the least likely to say that Israel (16%) or the United States and other Western countries (30%) are responsible for the conflict in the Middle East and are the most likely to place blame on Hamas and the Palestinians (12%) or no one in particular (16%).

Among the broader population, most consider the United States and other Western countries most responsible for the continued bloodshed and instability in the Middle East (38%)—even more than Israel (22%) or Hamas (8%).

Social Media Contributes to Young Russians’ Alternative Views
-------------------------------------------------------------

Overall, pluralities of both Russian youth and older generations do not side with either party in the conflict, believe Israeli military operations in Gaza have gone too far, and blame the United States and other Western countries for the continued bloodshed in the region. However, younger Russians do so to a lesser extent than their elders and view Israel, the United States, and the West through a relatively more positive lens.

Why might this be? A [February 2024 Chicago Council-Levada Center survey](https://globalaffairs.org/research/public-opinion-survey/young-russians-are-skeptical-most-media-outlets)
 of just the youth population finds that they primarily receive their news and information about the world from digital media sources, like social media platforms, Telegram channels, and blogs. Unlike older generations, who most often turn to traditional, state-controlled media outlets like television, radio, and newspapers for their news, young Russians are exposed to more diverse sources of information online that are less censored and restricted by the Russian government. As a result, their political sentiments and views of Russian foreign policies differ from those of older generations, who are more likely to accept state narratives that are propagated through traditional media outlets.

Conclusion
----------

Despite the fall of Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria and Russia’s withdrawal from the country, Putin’s diplomatic support for the Palestinians, Hamas, and Iran has helped to counter Western influence in the Middle East and emphasize Russia’s role in the region. While young Russians share Putin’s anti-Western outlook on the conflict, they may be more likely to give Israel the benefit of the doubt than older generations of Russians.

Generational differences in views toward the Israel-Gaza war may exist as a result of the youth population’s exposure to diverse narratives and sources of information online. In the current atmosphere that squelches dissent or protest in Russia, it is possible that young Russians may be projecting their position on their own country’s war in Ukraine onto their views of the war in the Middle East. Russian youth are far less likely than their elders to [personally support the military operation in Ukraine](https://globalaffairs.org/research/public-opinion-survey/young-russians-feel-more-threatened-terrorism-war-ukraine)
 and could be voicing some opposition to the state’s official narratives about both conflicts.

Sha'aban al-Dalou - seen here in a selfie he took with members of his family - was killed when an Israeli strike set fire to his tent in central Gaza

_**Warning: This piece contains graphic descriptions of death and injury**_

There is no conscience. There is no humanity. There are only leaders who watch and do not act.

This is what Ahmed al-Dalou believes, as the images of his family burning replay in his mind. He says his life is gone. It died in the inferno of al-Aqsa compound with his boys and wife in the early hours of Monday 14 October.

In front of him on the ground is a shroud, wrapped around the body of Abdulrahman,12, his youngest son.

The child lingered in agony for four days after the fire, sparked by an Israeli strike. The day before he died Ahmed saw him in hospital and he was able to tell his father: “Don’t be worried, I am OK dad… I’m fine. Don’t be afraid.”

Ahmed is half speaking, half crying, as he talks of what has been taken from him.

“Three times I tried to pull him \[Abdulrahman\] out of the fire, but his body fell back into it.”

His older brother, Sha'aban, 19, and his mother, Alaa, 37, both died on the night of the fire.

Sha'aban became a new symbol of Gaza’s terrible suffering. Images of him writhing in agony as he burned to death in the family’s tent were shared around the world on social media.

There are burns all over Ahmed’s face and hands. The tone of his voice is high, a keening sound. Of the anonymous pilot who sent the missile, and the leaders who gave him orders, Ahmed said: “They broke my heart, and they broke my spirit… I wish the fire had burned me.”

The strike happened at about 01:15 local time last Monday (23:15 BST on Sunday).

The Israeli military said it was targeting a Hamas "command and control" centre in the al-Aqsa hospital compound in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza Strip.

Hamas denies operating in hospitals.

Ahmed al-Dalou survived the fire which burned through tents at the al-Aqsa complex - but suffered burns to his face and hands trying to rescue his family

Four people were killed immediately and dozens more wounded, including many with severe burn injuries. The Israel Defense Forces said it was “reviewing the incident”.

A spokesperson for the White House told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that footage of the fire was “deeply disturbing” and called on Israel to do more to protect civilians.

“Israel has a responsibility to do more to avoid civilian casualties - and what happened here is horrifying - even if Hamas was operating near the hospital in an attempt to use civilians as human shields.”

The US and other powers, including Britain, have expressed concern about civilian casualties since the early stages of the war.

Palestinians tried to battle the fire which tore through tents being used by displaced people

People are burned to death, blown to pieces, and shot every day in this war.

Most of the time the death agonies happen away from the cameras. It is the frantic search for survivors in the rubble, the dramatic scenes at hospitals, the endless stream of funerals, that are captured by cameras.

But the death of Sha'aban al-Dalou was different. His hand can be seen, reaching out of the inferno, a figure wrapped in flame, writhing and beyond the reach of any help.

In the days following his death Sha'aban’s own videos and photographs emerged. He was a typical teenager of his generation, aware of the power of social media, adept at recording his daily life.

The burning figure from the night of fire appeared to the world as an articulate, intelligent teenager, a software engineering student, a young man who took care of his family planning for a new life outside Gaza. He filmed himself donating blood and encouraged others to do the same.

“We saw so many injuries, many children are in dire need of blood… All we demand is for a ceasefire and this tragedy to end.”

We are only able to tell the story of al-Dalou family because of our own local journalist who went to meet the survivors. International journalists from media organisations, including the BBC, are not given independent access to Gaza by Israel.

*   [UN accuses Israel of war crimes over attacks on Gaza hospitals](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c2lnw2gvllxo)
    

In a video recorded in the tent where he died Sha'aban described how his family had been displaced five times since the war began a year ago. He had two sisters, and two younger brothers.

“We live in very hard circumstances,” he said. “We suffer from various things such as homelessness, limited food, and extremely limited medicine.”

In the background, as he speaks, there is the loud mechanical hum of an Israeli observation drone, a constant in the daily and nightly soundtrack of Gaza.

The surviving brother of Sha'aban and Abdulrahman, Mohammed al-Dalou, told the BBC that he had tried to go into the flames to rescue his older brother.

But other injured people had held him back, fearing he too would be killed. Mohammed did not sleep in the family tent, but outside on the street where he kept watch over their piled belongings.

“I was screaming for someone to let me go, but in vain… My brother’s leg was trapped and he couldn’t free himself. I think you saw it in the video. He was raising his hand.

"That was my brother. He was my support in this world.”

Sha'aban would come and wake him for prayers in the morning with a bottle of water and he would tell him: “I’ll work for you.”

! <image:2107>!Mohammed al-Dalou, aged about 17, is a smooth-faced young man in a t-shirt. He's pictured in front of wrecked buildings following the air strike on the al-Aqsa complex in the Gaza Strip.  <image:2115>

Mohammed al-Dalou saw his loved ones die in the fire

Mohammed recalled how the brothers set up a stall at the gates of the hospital selling food that the family made.

“We managed everything with our hard work. Everything we had was from our effort. We would get food and drink… then everything was lost.”

He saw the burned bodies, but could only identify his mother. Although her remains had been mutilated by fire, he recognised a distinctive bracelet.

“Without it, I wouldn’t have known she was my mother. Her hand was detached from her body, but the bracelet was still on it. I took it off her hand.”

This is his only memento of the woman who was “the kindness in our home".

The al-Dalou family is in shock. The survivors mourn the dead. Our BBC colleague asked Mohammed about the psychological cost of seeing his loved ones die.

“I can’t describe it. I can’t describe how I felt. I want to explain it to people, but I can’t. I can’t describe it. I saw my brother burning in front of me, and my mother too.”

Then, as if he is posing a question on behalf of the dead, he asks: “What more do you need, and you stay silent? You see us burning, and you stay silent.”

A weekend of death and destruction gave way to another day of carnage Monday in Gaza and Lebanon as Israeli forces struck multiple sites in both places. Israel suffered its own losses as troops came under fire from Hezbollah. But much of the focus fell on Gaza and an Israeli attack outside a major hospital. Leila Molana-Allen reports. A warning, images and accounts in this story are disturbing.

*   **Geoff Bennett:**
    
    Welcome to the "News Hour."
    
    A weekend of death and destruction gave way to another day of carnage in Gaza and Lebanon, as Israeli forces struck multiple sites in both places, killing dozens. Israel suffered its own losses as its troops in the north came under fire from Hezbollah.
    
*   **Amna Nawaz:**
    
    That drone attack killed four Israeli soldiers, but much focus fell again on Gaza and an Israeli attack outside a major hospital in Gaza's north.
    
    That is where Leila Molana-Allen begins our coverage tonight.
    
*   **And a warning:**
    
    Images and accounts in this story are disturbing.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    Burned alive in a hospital bed, an I.V. that was supposed to heal became shackles. Last night, in Central Gaza's Deir al Balah, screams echoed through the night, as an Israeli airstrike hit a makeshift tent village outside Al-Aqsa Hospital, setting the tents and part of the building ablaze.
    
*   **Auoni Khattab, Displaced Gazan (through interpreter):**
    
    There were people trapped inside the fire and we were unable to pull them out. A human being burned alive in front of your eyes, and you can't rescue him. He turned to ashes.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    At least four people were killed and dozens injured. Today, as the smoke cleared, doctors attempted to tend their burns without painkillers or ointments. Survivors sifted through the rubble of their temporary homes.
    
*   **Uhm Mahmoud Wadhi, Displaced Gazan (through interpreter):**
    
    Everything has burned, everything. As you see, I'm a mother of seven daughters. Where shall I go? My tent has collapsed, destroyed. All our clothes and belongings are gone. Who should we speak to? Where is the safety? We are calling on all countries, the whole world, to stand by our side and stop the war on us. We are exhausted. We have had enough.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    Nearby, in Nuseirat, a night of horror for displaced families, as the IDF struck an UNRWA school where families were seeking shelter. The attack killed at least 22 people, including 15 children.
    
*   **Fatima Al Ajab, Displaced Gazan (through interpreter):**
    
    (through interpreter): They were sleeping unarmed. They're innocent. This is little Rahad's blanket here. She was only 2 years old. This morning, they removed their bodies, but the fire was still everywhere. Then there was another wave of airstrikes. The injured and dead were everywhere.
    
    We have had enough of this. Have mercy on us. They took their childhoods away. They took our smiles away. They have taken away every beautiful detail in our lives.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    Fatima's son says all he wants is freedom from this war. He doesn't fear death anymore. He's seen too much.
    
*   **Abdullah Al Ajab, Displaced Gazan (through interpreter):**
    
    The fire was burning for three hours while we were carrying the dead and collecting their cut-off fingers, which we put in a box and took them to the hospital. The children here are dying. Everyone is going to die. We're not going to keep going from place to place. At least we will die in our country.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    In Israel last night, an IDF base south of Haifa was hit by a Hezbollah drone. The strike killed four soldiers and wounded dozens of others.
    
    Even as the United States sends a new missile defense system to Israel, Israelis worry their air defense can't handle the increasing threat from drones.
    
*   **Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, Spokesperson, Israeli Defense Forces (through interpreter):**
    
    We are required to provide better protection. We will investigate this incident, learn and improve. Our mission is to better protect our soldiers and citizens of Israel.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    As IDF troops push further across the border into south Lebanon, Israeli soldiers posted videos of themselves inside Lebanese homes.
    
    After multiple attacks on UNIFIL bases by Israeli troops left several U.N. peacekeepers wounded, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated his demand that peacekeepers withdraw.
    
*   **Benjamin Netanyahu, Israeli Prime Minister (through interpreter):**
    
    It is time for you to remove UNIFIL from Hezbollah strongholds and from the fighting areas. The IDF has repeatedly asked for this and has been met with repeated refusals, all aimed at providing a human shield to Hezbollah terrorists. Your refusal to evacuate the UNIFIL soldiers makes them hostages of Hezbollah.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    The U.N. maintains they must stay under international law and that it's incumbent on Israeli and Lebanese forces to ensure their safety.
    
    The IDF demanded the evacuation of a further 20 towns and villages. Fully a third of the country is now under fire. Yesterday, a century-old souk and mosque in Nabatiyeh were razed to the ground; 2,300 people in Lebanon are now dead, nearly 11,000 injured.
    
    The IDF says it will tell Lebanese when they can return, but many of their homes and entire villages have been flattened and the bombing campaign is escalating across the country. In the past few days, Christian towns in the north have been targeted for the first time, while, in the capital, the strike zone continues to expand often without warning.
    
    Mohammad was left reeling after the streets housing his family home and his gym business in a calm central Beirut neighborhood were hit within five minutes of each other. The area had become home to dozens of displaced families who fled from the south. His family survived, but many in their building didn't.
    
*   **Mohammad Salamoun, Beirut Resident (through interpreter):**
    
    We're all families here, no weapons or Hezbollah leaders or anything. I don't know what they're thinking that they could kill us like this. When you see people dead in body parts all over the place, you don't know how to feel, especially after the terror we experienced after the strike.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    Some have decided they can't take it anymore. Nearly 100,000 Lebanese have fled to Syria, taking their chances with a stagnant civil war there over an escalating one here.
    
    After one airstrike too many, Widad and her teenage daughter left home with what they could carry.
    
*   **Widad Lakhal, Displaced From Lebanon (through interpreter):**
    
    My heart is in Lebanon. We will definitely return to Lebanon. I consider my country to be Lebanon, frankly, but fear. One can't trust Israel. It targets all the places.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    As the conflict spreads, this region is no longer boiling. It is burning.
    
    For the "PBS News Hour," I'm Leila Molana-Allen in Beirut.

**Iran launches major missile attack on Israel** **The Iranian airstrikes come in the wake of stepped-up Israeli military operations in Lebanon against Hezbollah, a group backed by Iran for decades. They include the assassination of Hezbollah's leader, [Hassan Nasrallah](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/28/g-s1-25302/who-was-hassan-nasrallah-the-hezbollah-leader-killed-by-israel)

Iran's mission at the United Nations [said in a statement](https://x.com/Iran_UN/status/1841162849286308106)
 on the social media platform X that Iran carried out a "legal, rational, and legitimate response to the terrorist acts of the Zionist regime." The statement added that "should the Zionist regime dare to respond or commit further acts of malevolence, a subsequent and crushing response will ensue."

Israel's government had warned the public that an attack was coming, and civilians took to bomb shelters nationwide before and during the strike. But the shooting remained at a relatively low level until Israel unleashed a much [larger campaign](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/29/g-s1-25348/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-hassan-nasrallah-timeline)
 two weeks ago.

Since then, Israeli airstrikes across Lebanon have killed more than 1,000 people and have forced many Lebanese civilians to flee their homes, according to Lebanon's Health Ministry. The strikes have targeted Hezbollah and its weapons, killing Nasrallah and several other top officials, [as well as many civilians](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/27/nx-s1-5130756/israeli-airstrikes-leave-blast-sites-and-wounded-in-lebanons-bekaa-valley)
.

Back in April, an Israeli strike killed several leaders of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in Damascus, Syria.

Iran responded by [attacking Israel](https://www.npr.org/2024/04/14/1244693369/iran-israel-middle-east-what-to-know)
 with more than 300 drones and missiles, but nearly all were intercepted by Israel and its allies, including the United States. **Maya Levin for NPR** ****hide caption****

Iran unleashed a major airstrike targeting sites across Israel on Tuesday night, while Israel's air defenses shot down most of the 180 incoming missiles, according to Israeli officials.

The Iranian attack marked the latest escalation in fighting that now stretches into several countries in the region, with warnings that more fighting is likely. destroyers fired a total of 12 interceptors at Iranian missiles as they headed to Israel. <image:2128>](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/g-s1-25657/israel-ground-offensive-lebanon)

Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile system intercepts rockets, as seen from Ashkelon, Israel, October 1 \[Amir Cohen/Reuters\]

By [Al Jazeera Staff](/author/al_jazeera_staff_150119130629458)

Published On 1 Oct 20241 Oct 2024

Iran has launched an unprecedented attack against Israel, firing a barrage of missiles at the country in [the latest escalation](/news/liveblog/2024/10/1/israels-war-on-gaza-israel-says-it-will-respond-to-iran-missile-attacks)
 amid weeks of soaring violence and tensions in the region.

Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said on Tuesday that it [fired missiles](/news/2024/10/1/israel-says-iran-launches-missile-attack-warns-residents-to-shelter)
 at Israel in response to deadly Israeli attacks against people in Gaza and Lebanon, as well as the assassinations of top IRGC, Hamas and Hezbollah leaders.

Alarms sounded in Israel on Tuesday evening as the missiles fell on major cities and towns.

Israel and its top ally, [the United States](/news/2024/10/1/us-says-helped-israel-thwart-iranian-attack-reasserts-ironclad-support)
, said their respective militaries worked together to shoot down most of the nearly 200 projectiles that were fired by Iran.

The Israeli army said only a “few” hits were recorded in central and southern parts of the country while two people were injured from falling shrapnel in the Tel Aviv area, according to Israel’s emergency service.

Here’s what we know about the attack, the wider context, and what could come next.

What happened?
--------------

*   The exact details of the Iranian operation remain unclear, but the IRGC said in a statement that the missiles were aimed at “vital military and security targets” in Israel.
*   The IRGC said later that its attack was aimed specifically at three military bases in the Tel Aviv area.
*   The attack, which was accompanied by a large-scale cyberattack, also employed Iran’s new Fatah hypersonic ballistic missiles for the first time, according to Iranian state media.
*   The Israeli military said it intercepted “a large number” of the 180 ballistic missiles launched by Iran, but that there were “isolated” impacts in central and southern Israel. We absolutely need a ceasefire.”

What comes next?
----------------

*   Israeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari said Israel is “fully prepared to defend and retaliate” against the Iranian attack, stressing that it would be in a “timely manner”.
*   Sullivan, the White House adviser, told reporters that the Biden administration “made clear that there will be consequences — severe consequences — for this attack” by Iran, and the US “will work with Israel to make that the case”.
*   Iran has warned Israel against responding to its attack, threatening to launch further missiles at the country if it retaliates.
*   Raed Jarrar, advocacy director at the US-based think tank DAWN, told Al Jazeera that the Middle East was now in “a full-scale regional war” that will not end without a change in American policy.

How have world leaders reacted to the Iranian attack?
-----------------------------------------------------

*   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Iran had “made a big mistake” and “will pay for it”.
*   Israel’s envoy to the United Nations, Danny Danon, said the country “will take all necessary measures to protect the citizens of Israel”: “As we have previously made clear to the international community, any enemy that attacks Israel should expect a severe response,” Danon wrote on social media.
*   Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said in a post on X that the attack was a “decisive response” to Israel’s “aggressions”. The IRGC said that 90 percent of the projectiles fired hit their targets.
*   US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the American military “coordinated closely” with its Israeli counterparts to shoot down the projectiles.
*   “US naval destroyers joined Israeli air defence units in firing interceptors to shoot down inbound missiles,” Sullivan told reporters at the White House.
*   Sullivan said no deaths were reported in Israel: “In short, based on what we know at this point, this attack appears to have been defeated and ineffective,” he said.

What was the attack in response to?
-----------------------------------

*   The IRGC said Tuesday’s attack was in response to the assassination of [Hassan Nasrallah](/news/2024/9/28/israels-military-says-it-has-killed-hezbollah-leader-hassan-nasrallah)
    , the head of Lebanese group Hezbollah, and IRGC commander Abbas Nilforoushan last week in Beirut, as well as the killing of Hamas leader [Ismail Haniyeh](/news/2024/7/31/life-of-defiance-ismail-haniyeh-hamas-political-boss-killed)
     in Tehran in July.
*   Experts have warned over the past year that the Middle East was on the brink of regional war amid Israel’s war on the Gaza Strip, which has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians since October 2023.
*   Lebanese group Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel shortly after the Gaza war began, saying it aimed to support Palestinians in the besieged enclave.
*   The Israeli military has been exchanging fire with Hezbollah across the Israel-Lebanon border since that time, displacing tens of thousands of people in both countries.
*   Over the past month, the Israeli military escalated its attacks on Lebanon, striking targets in the capital Beirut and fuelling more [fears of an all-out war](/news/2024/9/24/disastrous-failure-how-biden-emboldened-israel-to-attack-lebanon)
    .

> Western hypocrisy is not just outrageous, but extremely dangerous. “Do not enter into a conflict with Iran.”
*   Mohammad Javad Zarif, the strategic adviser to Pezeshkian, said “Iran has an inherent right of self-defence against repeated Israeli armed attacks against Iranian territory and its citizens.”
*   Hamas, the Palestinian group that governs Gaza, welcomed the Iranian attack as “heroic” and said it sent “a strong message to the Zionist enemy and its fascist government that will help deter and rein in their terrorism”.
*   The US pledged its “ironclad” support for Israel, with President Joe Biden saying that his country was “fully, fully, fully supportive of Israel”. 
> Western States have aided and abetted the Israeli genocide in Gaza and acquiesced in Israeli aggressions against Iran, Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and other countries in the region. “You’re going to get into the type of retaliatory action, back and forth, that spawns a greater war,” he told Al Jazeera.
*   Rahman added that Israel “has been trying to invite this war” through [its actions](/news/2024/9/20/israel-hits-beirut-lebanon-air-strike-hezbollah-fires-rockets)
     over the past several months. “Let Netanyahu know that Iran does not seek war, but it stands firmly against any threat,” he wrote. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Washington would “stand by the people of Israel at this critical moment”.
*   The Pentagon [also said](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3922464/readout-of-secretary-of-defense-lloyd-j-austin-iiis-call-with-israeli-minister/)
     US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and his Israeli counterpart Yoav Gallant had discussed “the severe consequences for Iran” should it launch a “direct military attack” on Israel. It did not say what those consequences would be.
*   German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said the country had warned Iran against “dangerous escalation”, which she said was “driving the region further to the brink of the abyss”.
*   UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned “the broadening of the Middle East conflict with escalation after escalation”."

**Hezbollah fired “Fadi-4” medium-range rockets targeting the Mossad headquarters near Tel Aviv on October 1**.\[72\] This is the second time that Hezbollah targeted Mossad Headquarters near Tel Aviv in the recent days.\[73\] Hezbollah also reported that it fired a Fadi-4 rocket targeting Unit 8200 headquarters near Tel Aviv for the first time on October 1.\[74\] Unit 8200 is an Israeli Intelligence Corps unit responsible for signals intelligence and similar activities.\[75\] Hezbollah separately claimed that it fired medium-range rockets targeting Sde Dov Airport, which closed in 2019, near Tel Aviv on October 1.\[76\] Hezbollah said that these attacks are part of “Operation Khaybar,” which is Hezbollah’s response to the Israeli airstrike that killed Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah on September 27.\[77\] The IDF has not commented on either attack at this time.

**Hezbollah continued its attack campaign targeting Israeli civilian and military sites in Israel on October 1.**  Hezbollah conducted a two-wave rocket attack targeting an IDF position in Metula.\[78\] The IDF said that it detected several projectiles over Metula and intercepted some of them.\[79\] Hezbollah also mortared Israeli forces in Avivim on October 1.\[80\] The IDF said that it also identified individual projectiles that fell in open areas in Avivim.\[81\] Hezbollah claimed on October 1 that the latest attack campaign against Israel is in response to Israel’s ”invasion” of Lebanese towns and villages.\[82\]

!

**Likely Iranian-backed Iraqi militias conducted a rocket attack targeting a US diplomatic facility near Baghdad International Airport on October 1.\[83\]** The US ambassador to Iraq announced that an attack took place at the Diplomatic Support Complex, which is a US State Department facility.\[84\] The attack occurred hours before the Iranian ballistic missile attack targeting Israel. We utterly condemn violations of the laws of armed conflict and the Geneva Conventions and crimes against humanity even though we do not describe them in these reports._

**Iran launched a two-wave ballistic missile attack that targeted Israel from Iranian territory on October 1.\[1\] Iran claimed to launch this attack in response to Israel’s killing of senior Axis of Resistance leaders including Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut, and Hamas Political Bureau Chairman Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.\[2\]** Iran launched approximately 180 ballistic missiles, including Emad and Ghadr ballistic missiles, from Iranian territory.\[3\] Iran claimed to launch its domestically produced hypersonic medium-range “Fattah-2” ballistic missile for the first time in the October 1 attack.\[4\] The IRGC claimed it launched Fattah missiles to destroy Israel's Arrow 2 and Arrow 3 anti-ballistic missile interception systems.\[5\] The IRGC conducted the October 1 operation with the approval of the Supreme National Security Council and “with the knowledge of” the Armed Forces General Staff.\[6\] Iranian Defense Minister Brigadier General Aziz Nasir Zadeh claimed that Iran targeted Israeli “military, operational and intelligence” centers associated with the killing of Ismail Haniyeh, which occurred in Tehran, Iran in July 2023.\[7\] Iranian Armed Forces General Staff-affiliated media claimed that Iran targeted the following airbases.\[8\]

*   The Nevatim Airbase, which houses Israeli F-35s, located outside of Beersheba, Israel.\[9\] Most of Israel’s F-35s were presumably airborne at the time of the attack, given that most of Israel’s aerial refuelers were airborne during the attack. Pro-Hezbollah media claimed this base was used in the Israeli killing of Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah.\[10\] Geolocated footage showed impacts to the base from missiles.\[11\]
*   The Hatzerim Airbase in the Negev Desert.\[12\]
*   The Tel Nof Airbase 20 kilometers south of Tel Aviv.\[13\] Geolocated footage showed missiles impacting at or near the Tel Nof Airbase.\[14\]

Geolocated footage also showed Iranian ballistic missiles impacting in at least three other locations:

*   An area south of Herzliya, Israel.\[15\] The geolocated footage depicts an area located near the IDF Glilot Intelligence Base, which houses IDF Unit 8200, which is the IDF’s signals collection unit, and the Mossad Headquarters.\[16\] Israel evacuated the Glilot Intelligence base before the attack.\[17\]
*   A school in Gedera, Israel, located near the Tel Nof Airbase.\[20\]
*   An area near the Ayalon Mall, Ramat Gan, Israel.\[18\] Ayalon Mall is immediately west of Yarkon Park, where Shin Bet is headquartered.\[19\]

The Iranian attack killed one Palestinian near Jericho in the West Bank, and shrapnel lightly injured two Israelis in Tel Aviv.\[21\]

!

**Iran likely intended to inflict significant damage on Israel by oversaturating Israeli air defenses, particularly in central Israel.** Iran launched approximately 180 ballistic missiles targeting Israel on October 1, compared to the approximately 120 ballistic missiles it fired at Israel in April 2024.\[22\] The April attack focused on Israeli positions in northern and southern Israel, with several ballistic missiles striking Nevatim Airbase.\[23\] This attack focused on at least three possible targets between Rehovot, south of Tel Aviv, and Herzliya, north of Tel Aviv. The increase in ballistic missiles may have been designed to overwhelm the Israeli Arrow ballistic missile defense system by saturating it with large numbers of systems in relatively small and densely populated areas.  The large quantity of ballistic missiles also represents a significant Iranian investment that Iran is unlikely to willingly forfeit in an attack for show.

**The IDF reported that Israel and its allies intercepted the “majority” of the Iranian ballistic missiles launched at Israel.** IDF Spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari stated that the missiles impacted some areas in central and southern Israel, but that the IDF and the US-led defensive coalition intercepted the majority of projectiles.\[24\] United States National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan separately described the Iranian attack as “defeated and ineffective.”\[25\] An unspecified US defense official stated that US destroyers stationed in the eastern Mediterranean Sea helped intercept the Iranian ballistic missiles.\[26\]  The USS Arleigh Burke, USS Cole, and USS Bulkeley are currently deployed to the eastern Mediterranean region.\[27\] The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) claimed that 90 percent of the missiles hit their intended targets without providing any evidence for these claims.\[28\]  

**Israel vowed to retaliate against Iran for the October 1 attack.** Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated at the beginning of the Israeli cabinet meeting that Iran “made a big mistake and will pay.”\[29\] Netanyahu reiterated that Israel would attack anyone who attacks them. IDF Spokesperson Daniel Hagari stated that Israel’s operational plans are ready and vowed that Israel will respond ”wherever, whenever, and however we choose.”\[30\] Israel previously conducted retaliatory airstrikes targeting an Artesh Air Force base in Esfahan, Iran, on April 18 in response to Iran’s April 13 drone and missile attack targeting Israel.\[31\] The IRGC warned on October 1 that it would conduct further attacks on Israel if Israel retaliates against Iran for its ballistic missile attack.\[32\]

**The IDF began the initial phase of its ground operation in southern Lebanon.** The IDF 98th Division began a “focused activity” on October 1 in what the IDF described would be a “targeted and delimited” operation in southern Lebanon.\[33\] The IDF said that a special operations brigade, a paratrooper brigade, and an armored brigade subordinate to the 98th Division have been preparing in recent weeks for the ground operation.\[34\] These units previously fought under the 98th Division for months in the Gaza Strip. <image:2136>

**Iran Update, October 1, 2024**

**Alexandra Braverman, Annika Ganzeveld, Kelly Campa, Carolyn Moorman, Siddhant Kishore, Katherine Wells, Ria Reddy, Johanna Moore, and Brian Carter**

**Information Cutoff: 2:00 pm ET**

_The Iran Update provides insights into Iranian and Iranian-sponsored activities abroad that undermine regional stability and threaten US forces and interests. The IDF’s cross-border operations, often led by the Egoz Unit, sometimes lasted multiple days and focused on destroying infrastructure belonging to Radwan forces located close to Israel.\[53\] The Egoz Unit was originally established in the 1990s as a raiding force specifically trained for operations in Lebanon against Hezbollah.\[54\] Unspecified Israeli officials said that the IDF’s current ground incursion into southern Lebanon will be ”an extension of the previous” raids with more units deployed to destroy infrastructure that smaller special forces could not.\[55\]

Hezbollah began its cross-border firing campaign in support of Palestinians in Gaza in October 2023. The IDF targeted and killed Hezbollah Unit 4400 commander Mohammad Jaafar Qasir in an airstrike in Beirut on October 1.\[59\] The IDF said that Unit 4400 is responsible for transferring weapons from Iran and its proxies to Hezbollah in Lebanon.\[60\] Qasir was a senior Hezbollah member who had been in his position for 15 years and was one of the ”most dominant” figures behind Iran’s ground line of communication through Syria to Hezbollah.\[61\] The IDF also killed the commander of the Syria-based Imam Hussein Division al Faqar Hinawi in Beirut on October 1.\[62\]  The IRGC formed the Imam Hussein Division in 2016.\[63\] The IDF said that the Imam Hussein Division had moved its headquarters to southern Lebanon since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war and operates closely with Hezbollah’s southern command units.\[64\]

**The IDF Air Force likely struck multiple Syrian Arab Army (SAA) positions in southern Syria on October 1, possibly to suppress SAA air defenses.\[65\]** The IDF also struck multiple locations in eastern Daraa and western Suwayda on October 1.\[66\] Syrian sources reported that the IDF targeted and eliminated the radar systems of five Syrian Arab Army (SAA) battalions, including those located at the al Thaala and al Khalkhala military airports in western Suwaida.\[67\] A Syrian outlet noted that the number of systems targeted, and Israel’s use of drones differentiates these strikes from Israel’s previous attacks targeting radar systems in southern Syria.\[68\]

**The IDF has previously conducted airstrikes targeting SAA sites in southern Syria in response to SAA's cooperation with Lebanese Hezbollah.\[69\]** The IDF has repeatedly targeted sites in Quneitra and Daraa provinces that Hezbollah fighters use as reconnaissance and observation points to observe the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights.\[70\] The IDF likely struck SAA sites in Suwayda and Daraa provinces on October 1 due to ongoing SAA-Hezbollah cooperation and possibly to continue to disrupt Hezbollah’s ability to receive weapons from Syrian territory. Iraqi media reported that ”elements outside the law” launched three Katyusha rockets from al Amiriya in Baghdad toward the complex.\[85\] Possible Iranian-backed Iraqi militants recently attacked the Baghdad Diplomatic Services Compound near Baghdad International Airport on September 10.\[86\]

A security source separately told Al Jazeera on October 1 that unspecified militants conducted a rocket attack targeting US forces at Ain al Asad airbase in Anbar Province, Iraq.\[87\] The Islamic Resistance in Iraq—a coalition of Iranian-backed Iraqi militias—denied responsibility for the attack.\[88\] Iranian-backed Iraqi militias have threatened in recent days to resume attacks targeting US forces if Israel launched a ground campaign into Lebanon.\[89\] Iranian state media claimed on October 1 that the United States has “officially entered” the war and that all US bases in the region are “legitimate targets” for the Axis of Resistance.\[90\] The Iraqi Resistance Coordination Committee, which is a coordinating body for Iranian-backed Iraqi militias, separately warned on October 1 that Iraqi militias will target “all US bases and interests” in the region if the United States attacks Iran or if Israel uses Iraqi airspace to attack Iran in retaliation for the Iranian attack on Israel.\[91\]

!

**The Islamic Resistance in Iraq—a coalition of Iranian-backed Iraqi militias—claimed three Arqab cruise missile attacks targeting unspecified locations in Israel on October 1.\[92\]**

**Houthi Spokesperson Yahya Sarea claimed that the Houthis launched one drone at Tel Aviv and four “Sammad 4” drones targeting unspecified sites in Eilat, Israel, on October 1, before Iran’s ballistic missile attack on Israel.**\[93\] Israeli media did not acknowledge the attack."

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \[Debbie Hill/AP\]

Published On 9 Jan 20259 Jan 2025

The Polish government has adopted a resolution promising that senior Israeli officials – including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu – can freely travel to Poland for the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp later this month.

Netanyahu faces an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for alleged war crimes in Israel’s war on Gaza.

“The Polish government treats the safe participation of the leaders of Israel in the commemorations on January 27, 2025, as part of paying tribute to the Jewish nation, millions of whose daughters and sons became victims of the Holocaust carried out by the Third Reich,” read the resolution, published by the office of Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk on Thursday.

Tusk told reporters that “whether it is the prime minister, the president or the minister – as it is currently declared – of education of Israel, whoever will come to Oswiecim for the celebrations in Auschwitz will be assured of safety and will not be detained.”

In November, the ICC issued [arrest warrants](/news/2024/11/21/netanyahu-gallant-issued-icc-arrest-warrants-for-war-crimes-whats-next)
 for Netanyahu and his ex-defence minister Yoav Gallant, as well as Hamas commander Ibrahim a-Masri, also known as Mohammed Deif, on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity.

Israel has condemned the warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant, saying that it has acted in self-defence triggered by Hamas’s [7 October 2023 attack](/news/2023/10/7/what-happened-in-israel-a-breakdown-of-how-the-hamas-attack-unfolded)
 on Israel.

As a member state of the ICC, Poland is required to detain suspects facing arrest warrants if they set foot on their soil, but the court has no way to enforce that. Israel is not a member of the ICC and disputes its jurisdiction.

Unclear if Netanyahu will attend
--------------------------------

On Wednesday, Bloomberg reported that Poland’s President Andrzej Duda wrote to Tusk asking that Netanyahu be allowed to attend the commemoration “unhindered”, given the event’s exceptional nature.

Malgorzata Paprocka, the head of Duda’s office, confirmed to state news agency PAP on Thursday that a letter had been sent.

“In the opinion of the president, there is one issue – precisely because it is the Auschwitz camp, every person from Israel, every representative of the authorities of this country should have the opportunity to take part in this exceptional event,” she said.

Prime Minister Tusk, who signed the resolution, said he had received information from the Israeli embassy that the country would be represented by its education minister.

Netanyahu has not said whether he would attend the Auschwitz commemoration. He has attended previous anniversary events at Auschwitz.

Over 1.1 million people, mostly Jews, died in gas chambers or from starvation, cold and disease at Auschwitz, which Nazi Germany set up in occupied Poland during World War II.

WARSAW — Poland’s President Andrzej Duda is asking the country’s government to ensure that [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2024-11-21/benjamin-netanyahu-hamas-international-criminal-court-arrest-warrants)
 can attend observances marking the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz later this month without the risk of being arrested, a Polish presidential aide said Thursday.

Netanyahu became an internationally wanted suspect after the International Criminal Court, the world’s top war crimes court, issued an arrest warrant for him and others in connection with the 15-month war in Gaza, accusing them of crimes against humanity.

There have been reports suggesting that the warrant could prevent Netanyahu from traveling to Poland to attend observances marking the anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp by Soviet forces on Jan.

The Polish Foreign Ministry, in response to an email query, said Thursday that “it has not received any information so far indicating that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is going to attend the celebration of the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz.”

“Poland is a safe country and any leader visiting Poland is entitled to protection granted by the Ministry of the Interior,” it added. The ministry also suggested that any idea that Netanyahu could be arrested in Poland is “fake news” that spread in U.S. Historians say that most of them, about a million, were Jewish, but the victims also included Poles, Roma, Soviet prisoners of war, and others.

Duda has asked the government of Prime Minister Donald Tusk to provide Netanyahu with protection from arrest, according to a top Duda aide, Malgorzata Paprocka, according to a report from PAP, the Polish state news agency.

Paprocka said that every Israeli state official and citizen should have the right to take part in the anniversary commemorations, and noted that “all instruments” related to ensuring Netanyahu’s stay in Poland are in the hands of Tusk’s government.

Bloomberg News first reported that Duda sent the request to Tusk by letter.

Paprocka said Duda’s office was still awaiting a reply.

According to Gaza's Health Ministry, more than 47,000 people have been killed in Israel's military incursion into the enclave, a response to the Hamas attacks on southern Israel on October 7, 2023, that killed some 1,200 people.

Israel is not a member of the ICC, but Poland is a founding member and legally bound to execute the warrant.

Safe conduct for Israeli PM
---------------------------

Citing "absolutely extraordinary circumstances," Polish President Andrzej Duda on January 9 asked [Donald Tusk](/en/donald-tusk/t-38238452)
 and his government to guarantee safe conduct for Netanyahu should he decide to participate in the event.

In a rare display of unanimity between the government and the president, Tusk's government passed a resolution supporting Duda's request the same day.

However, the resolution did not mention Netanyahu by name, which was understandable given that the Israeli prime minister did not actually plan to attend in person — as [_The Times of Israel_ confirmed](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/netanyahu-aide-says-attending-auschwitz-memorial-in-poland-currently-not-in-the-program/ "External link — The Times of Israel confirmed")
 on January 9.

Nevertheless, the decision was met with opposition and protest in [Poland](/en/poland/t-19070837)
.

So, if Netanyahu was not planning to come, why did the Polish government pass the resolution in the first place?

'Tribute to the Jewish people'
------------------------------

The resolution stated that the guarantee of safety for Israeli representatives was "part of paying tribute to the Jewish people, millions of whose daughters and sons were victims of the Holocaust perpetrated by the Third Reich."

Tusk himself said the case was "very delicate."

"On the one hand," he said, "we have the verdict of an international tribunal, but on the other, it is absolutely clear to me that any representative of the Israeli authorities should have every right to and sense of security when visiting the Auschwitz camp, especially on the anniversary \[of its liberation\]."

Critical reactions in Poland
----------------------------

One of the first prominent critics of the government's decision was a respected Polish judge, Piotr Hofmanski, a former ICC president.

Hofmanski underlined Poland's unconditional obligation under international law to execute the warrant. [Skip to more DW sites](#footer)

There were protests in Warsaw on the day after the Polish government passed a resolution guaranteeing safe conduct for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin NetanyahuImage: Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto/IMAGO

There are places on Polish soil that hold a deep significance not only for Poles, but also for Jews and many people in Israel. Only 24.2% favored guaranteeing Netanyahu safe conduct, and 16.6% were undecided.

Pro-Palestinian activists organized a protest in Warsaw, during which several hundred people chanted "Arrest Netanyahu!" and "The Polish government's got blood on its hands."

A group of NGOs, including the initiative East, a Gen-Z organization fighting for social justice and against climate change, Action for Democracy and All-Poland Women's Strike also wrote an open letter asking Tusk to withdraw the resolution.

The Polish Supreme Bar Council appealed to the president and the government to adhere unconditionally to the rule of law and implement it in word and deed.

In an open letter, the council stressed that the rulings of courts and international tribunals must not be viewed as a matter of choice and that the non-execution of the ICC warrant would undermine "the trust of the citizens in the rule of law in Poland" and is dangerous — even if the external security of the country dictates it.

What's the role of the US?
--------------------------

The reference to Poland's external security could have been a response to media reports about another alleged motivation behind the resolution.

The arrest of the head of the Israeli government at the most notorious and symbolic site of the Holocaust would undoubtedly spark an international outcry and trigger a fierce response from the recently inaugurated Trump administration, a strong ally of both Poland and Israel.

There are claims the resolution sought to avert the risk of a crisis in US-Polish relations right at the start of Trump's second administrationImage: Carlos Barria/REUTERS

Polish media quoted anonymous sources close to the government who claimed that the resolution was mainly aimed at averting the very real risk of a crisis in [US](/en/united-states-of-america/t-19065189)
\-Polish relations right at the start of the second [Trump](/en/donald-trump/t-19434433)
 administration.

Moreover, on January 9, the US House of Representatives passed a bill threatening to impose sanctions against anyone who helps the ICC prosecute US citizens or US allies, which includes Israel.

Did the president set a trap for Tusk?
--------------------------------------

Whether it was his intention or not, President Duda, due to leave office at the end of his second term in August, created a difficult situation for the government four months ahead of country's presidential election.

This election could determine whether Prime Minister Tusk will have an ally in the presidential palace and, therefore, a potentially easier path to implementing his campaign promises or face the prospect of working with a second president linked to the [opposition Law and Justice (PiS) party](/en/law-and-justice-pis/t-66789976)
.

The resolution passed by Tusk and his government might not only cost his ally and preferred presidential candidate, Rafal Trzaskowski, votes, but may have dented Poland's credibility on the global stage — with the notable exception of its relations with the Trump White House.

The resolution pledging not to arrest Netanyahu was also met with widespread opposition across the Polish political spectrum. Journalists, experts, bloggers, political commentators, judicial authorities and the opposition — from the far left to the far right — condemned the decision, albeit for different reasons.

The resolution caused uproar among left-wing activists and politicians, as well as supporters of the Palestinian cause.

"Not in my name," posted Adrian Zandberg, leader of the Polish left-wing Razem (Together) party, on X (formerly Twitter).

This attitude was also reflected in opinion polls.

* Be truthful, brief, do not add any additional information besides the information given in the Record. 
* Link key sources in your summary. Use Markdown notation for that. You may link them in-line.
* Don't state the Claim again. Rather focus on the key insights of the fact-check.
* Simply print just the summary.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "Netanyahu left Israel and fled to Poland amid Iran's missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024."

## Actions
```
web_search("Netanyahu Poland October 1 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/9/poland-says-it-will-protect-benjamin-netanyahu-from-potential-arrest](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/9/poland-says-it-will-protect-benjamin-netanyahu-from-potential-arrest)) reported on January 9, 2025, that Poland would allow senior Israeli officials, including Netanyahu, to travel to Poland for the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau in January 2025, despite an ICC arrest warrant for Netanyahu. The Los Angeles Times ([https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-01-09/polish-president-seeks-protection-for-netanyahu-if-he-attends-auschwitz-anniversary-event](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-01-09/polish-president-seeks-protection-for-netanyahu-if-he-attends-auschwitz-anniversary-event)) also reported on January 9, 2025, that the Polish President is seeking protection for Netanyahu if he attends the Auschwitz anniversary event.

DW.com ([https://www.dw.com/en/auschwitz-poland-netanyahu-arrest-pledge/a-71377468](https://www.dw.com/en/auschwitz-poland-netanyahu-arrest-pledge/a-71377468)) reported on January 22, 2025, that the Polish government guaranteed safe passage to Netanyahu for an event at Auschwitz, despite an ICC arrest warrant, and that Netanyahu was not planning to attend. <image:k>


## Elaboration
1.  The provided evidence indicates that in January 2025, Poland was preparing to protect Netanyahu from potential arrest related to an ICC warrant, and that Netanyahu was invited to an event in Poland.
2.  The evidence does not mention any missile attacks on Israel or Netanyahu fleeing to Poland on October 1, 2024.
3.  The claim is not supported by the evidence. The evidence suggests that Netanyahu was invited to Poland in January 2025, not that he fled there in October 2024.


## Final Judgement
The claim that Netanyahu fled to Poland amid an Iranian missile attack on October 1, 2024, is not supported by the provided evidence. The evidence indicates that Poland was preparing to protect Netanyahu from potential arrest in January 2025, and that he was invited to an event in Poland. There is no mention of a missile attack or Netanyahu fleeing to Poland in October 2024.

`false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is false. While reports from January 2025, such as those from [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/9/poland-says-it-will-protect-benjamin-netanyahu-from-potential-arrest) and the [Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-01-09/polish-president-seeks-protection-for-netanyahu-if-he-attends-auschwitz-anniversary-event), indicate that Poland was prepared to protect Netanyahu from arrest and that he was invited to an event, there is no evidence of him fleeing to Poland on October 1, 2024, amid an Iranian missile attack.

Some on X are calling it the ‘Israeli Motorola massacre,’ blaming Motorola for manufacturing the deadly Hezbollah pagers that exploded in Lebanon. For years, the American mobile company has faced boycotts, accused of supplying the Israeli army with communication and bomb equipment devices. We tell you more in this edition of Truth or Fake.

Israeli airstrikes have devastated southern Lebanon, and Hezbollah has launched hundreds of missiles into Israeli territory. However, some viral images claiming to show the aftermath are fakeImage: Gil Nechushtan/AP Photo/picture alliance

Advertisement

Since the past weekend, Israel and Hezbollah have engaged in the [most intense exchange of fire](/en/middle-east-idf-prepares-for-possibility-of-lebanon-entry/live-70318800)
 one year into the Israel-Hamas war in [Gaza](/en/gaza/t-19074241)
. The armed wing of the Iran-backed Shiite political party and militant group, which is considered a terrorist organization by the US, Germany and several Sunni Arab countries, fired projectiles deeper into Israeli territory than ever before.

On Saturday, Israel launched waves of strikes against Hezbollah targets, describing the action as preemptive to thwart a planned attack. Hezbollah, in turn, fired a barrage of rockets and other projectiles at Israel, claiming it was in retaliation for Israeli strikes in [Lebanon](/en/lebanon/t-19131661)
.

Lebanon's Health Ministry reported at least 569 people killed, including 50 children, and more than 1,800 wounded since Monday.

The recent escalation between [Israel](/en/israel/t-19067044)
 and [Hezbollah](/en/hezbollah/t-41508807)
 has also fueled a surge of misleading content. A recurrent theme in social media posts involves manipulated visuals claiming to show Hezbollah's attacks on Israel. Often out of context or entirely unrelated, these videos have gone viral on social media platforms. [DW Fact check](/en/fact-check/t-56584214)
 investigated some of these viral claims.

Does this image show the aftermath of a Hezbollah attack on Ramat David airbase?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Claim:** "_Despite Israel's hermetic military censorship. A photograph was leaked of the Ramat David base, which was attacked by Hezbollah at dawn today. Israel does not acknowledge that anything has happened at this air base,_" reads [the caption of a viral image](https://archive.is/uwdRN "External link — the caption of a viral image")
 circulating on social media. The image shows a large aircraft engulfed in flames, surrounded by vehicles at an airport, with military trucks and personnel scattered in the scene.

The Hezbollah attack targeted the Ramat David airbase near Haifa on Sunday, but this picture is fakeImage: Reddit

The image has been shared across multiple platforms, including  [X](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/OH9Ef "External link — X")
 (formerly Twitter), [Reddit](https://archive.is/uwdRN "External link — Reddit")
, and [Threads](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/wjvSK "External link — Threads")
, reaching users in several languages, including Arabic.

**DW Fact check:** Fake.

Israeli media have [reported](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-821267 "External link — reported")
 on the attack at Ramat David airbase in the North of the country, which occurred on Sunday morning. However, there are clear indications that the image being shared is AI-generated.

One of the most prominent signs of this being AI-generated content is the blurry and indecipherable text. The vehicle in the middle, closer to the camera, shows what appears to be writing on its side, but the text is distorted and unreadable. Some characters resemble Hebrew letters, but others don't make any sense. This is a common AI flaw, known as a "hallucination," which occurs when the system creates elements that don't exist or don't make sense in the real world.

Some details in the image are distorted, unrealistic or blurred which are indicators of it being AI-generatedImage: Reddit

The image also shows multiple visual distortions, particularly in the shapes and outlines of objects. The truck in the foreground has an awkward curve in its loading section. The vehicles closest to the plane seem fused, with their outlines merging unnaturally, making them difficult to distinguish. Most military vehicles in the image look unrealistic. Such errors are typical in AI-generated images.

Also, the aircraft's wing appears misaligned, and its body has an odd bump. Even more telling is the unrealistic clarity of the flames in the image, which contrasts with the somewhat blurry and distorted vehicles and other surrounding details.

The inconsistencies strongly indicate that the image is AI-generated rather than an authentic photograph of a real attack on the Ramat David airbase.

DW Fact check conducted an analysis using Truemedia, a nonprofit tool specialized in detecting political deepfakes on social media. The tool's digital analysis uncovered substantial signs of manipulation, which the platform later corroborated by human experts.

An analysis by Truemedia, a tool that detects digitally manipulated images, indicates that the image is most likely AI-generated.Image: Screenshot truemedia.org

Footage of fireworks in Algeria and fire in Indonesia claimed to show Israel under attack
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Claim:** A viral [post](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/x9SDs "External link — post")
 shared on September 22 reads, "_Hezbollah turned Israel to Isra-Hell_," accompanied by a minute-long video. The video is a compilation of several unrelated clips, with sounds of gunfire, sirens, and screaming added throughout the video to create a sense of continuity. The first few seconds show glowing lights illuminating the night sky in a public space, while the second part depicts scenes of chaos, with areas engulfed in flames at night.

The post has been widely circulated in multiple languages, including [English](https://archive.is/gvqGS "External link — English")
, [Arabic](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/bxOb7 "External link — Arabic")
, [Urdu](https://archive.ph/omoFJ "External link — Urdu")
 and [Hindi,](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/Amha5 "External link — Hindi,")
all suggesting the video shows the aftermath of a Hezbollah missile attack on Israel.

A quick search of a screenshot from the video reveals it is old and unrelated to the current tensions. In many cases, fake videos and misinformation can be debunked through a reverse image search.Image: X

**DW Fact check:** False.

A reverse image search of a screenshot from the first part of the clip reveals that the video is not from the recent conflict. It originates from Algeria and shows the [celebrations of the 103rd anniversary](https://archive.is/B6E0I "External link — celebrations of the 103rd anniversary")
 of the Mouloud d'Alger soccer club — not military action.

There are [more videos](https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/vFs3bALRF1 "External link — more videos")
 of the same event online, which show the police officers in uniforms labeled "G.I.P," consistent with those of [Algerian law enforcement.](https://archive.ph/VtzUB "External link — Algerian law enforcement.")
 And these celebrations took place at the beginning of August.

The same applies to other parts of the clips. They are also unrelated to the current conflict between Hezbollah and Israel and have been circulating for at least two years, [previously claiming](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/rD9EW "External link — previously claiming")
 to [show a fire](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/06ytm "External link — show a fire")
 in an Indonesian rural area. 

DW could not verify the exact locations where the videos were filmed. However, the fact that the clips are at least two years old confirms they have no connection to the ongoing hostilities. 

Some clips have been mirrored from original versions, making reverse image searches more difficult and complicating efforts to track down the original sources of the images.

We were unable to track down prior publications for one segment of the clip. 

Footage of Russian oil refinery attack misrepresented as Hezbollah drone strike
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Claim:** "_Hezbollah drones reached the oil refineries in the north of occupied Palestine_," claims a [post on X](https://archive.ph/qP3YN "External link — post on X")
. Hezbollah and other anti-Israeli groups refer to Israel as "occupied Palestine" because they do not recognize it as a legitimate country. Attached to the post is a video purportedly showing a drone flying over an industrial site, striking part of the facility, and exploding. The footage has been shared by numerous accounts on X with similar claims.

This footage has been verified to show a Ukrainian drone strike on a Russian oil refinery in July 2024Image: X

**DW Fact check:** False.

A reverse image search of a screenshot from the video reveals it dates back to the end of July. The footage actually shows a [Ukrainian drone attack on an oil refinery in Tuapse](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/a5NSXybWbWk "External link — Ukrainian drone attack on an oil refinery in Tuapse")
, located in the Krasnodar region of Russia, approximately two months ago.

This is a view of the oil refinery in Tuapse in 2020, with storage tanks and a valley shape matching the location seen in the video.Image: Igor Onuchin/TASS/imago

Hezbollah [has claimed](https://archive.ph/r9iC5 "External link — has claimed")
 it targeted several Israeli military installations on Tuesday, including an explosives factory 60 kilometers (37 miles) into Israel. 

The militant group also reportedly launched a ballistic missile at Tel Aviv. While the Israeli military intercepted the surface-to-surface missile, there were no reports of casualties or damage. This marked the first time a projectile fired from Lebanon had reached central Israel, according to the Israeli military.

However, many images circulating online that claim to show the aftermath of these attacks are fake.

I løpet av det siste året har volumet av manipulert informasjon fra Midtøsten blitt stadig større. Her kan du se hvordan de prøver å lure deg.

Brennende fly, enorme missilangrep og menn uten kjønnsorganer.

Helt siden Hamas-terrorister kjørte over grensen til Israel 7. oktober 2023, har sosiale medier vært fylt med grufulle videoer og bilder fra krigen i Midtøsten.

De dagene krigen er på sitt mest intense, kan mengden av bilder være overveldende, og mengden feilinformasjon som deles har også vokst siden krigsutbruddet.

Konflikten har fått et eget digitalt liv, hvor mange av deltakerne ikke lenger ser ut til å være interessert i å etablere en presis forståelse av hva som skjer. I stedet angriper de bare hverandres synspunkter på nettet.

Og det er nå nesten umulig å fastslå hva som er sant og usant hvis du kun får informasjonen din fra medier som X, Instagram, WhatsApp, Telegram og Facebook.

Hvordan oppdage falskt innhold?
-------------------------------

Hvis du stiller deg selv de riktige spørsmålene, er det mindre sannsynlig at du blir et offer for manipulerte bilder og historier.

Hvem er kilden?

Undersøk hvem avsenderen er. Se hva annet kilden deler, og sjekk om vedkommende vil stå ved informasjonen med navn og ansikt.

Hvorfor ble materialet delt?

Manipulert materiale er ofte designet for å skape en følelsesmessig respons og for å spille på folks fordommer.

Er det tegn på AI?

Bilder generert av kunstig intelligens kan fortsatt ofte avsløres ved å zoome inn på detaljer. Noen ganger mangler detaljer som fingre og tær, eller det er for mange.

Stemmer datoen?

Ser du egentlig på et gammelt innlegg? Sjekk om været, årstid og tid på døgnet stemmer overens med hendelsen som avsender sier bildet er fra.

Hvem delte den først?

Bruk et bildesøkeprogram som Google Lens for å finne ut om andre også deler bildet og i hvilken sammenheng det deles.

Nedenfor har vi samlet fem eksempler på noen av de manipulerte historiene og videoopptakene, der sannheten igjen og igjen blir et av krigens mest involverte ofre.

Skadene til Hizbollah-folket
----------------------------

  ![FEIL: En rekke pro-israelske profiler på X delte disse bildene kort tid etter angrepet. Foto: X / @hamasatrocities](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063502.webp?imageId=17063502&x=1.71&y=1.63&cropw=96.00&croph=95.71&width=675&height=669 "Foto: X / @hamasatrocities")

Da Israel startet sin aksjon mot Hizbollah-militsen i Libanon 17. september 2024, skjedde det med et angrep der militsmennenes personsøkere plutselig eksploderte.

Angrepet drepte 12 mennesker og skadet over 2700, og det tok ikke lang tid før sosiale medier ble fylt med bilder av ofrene og restene av de eksploderte personsøkerne.

Noen av bildene viste til og med – ifølge avsenderne – at flere mannlige Hizbollah-medlemmer mistet kjønnsorganene under eksplosjonene.

  ![FEIL: Ifølge en israelsk soldat som kaller seg Daniel Hanukha på X, er dette skader forårsaket under personsøkerangrepet. Foto: X / @israelifihther](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063525.webp?imageId=17063525&width=978&height=551 "Foto: X / @israelifihther")

FEIL: Ifølge en israelsk soldat som kaller seg Daniel Hanukha på X, er dette skader forårsaket under personsøkerangrepet. Foto: X / @israelifihther

Bildene, som er vannmerket på arabisk, ble delt blant annet av den proisraelske profilen [Hamas Atrocities](https://x.com/HamasAtrocities/status/1837121304517898265)
 med teksten «konsekvenser».

De ble delt av flere israelske soldater, som profilen [Daniel Hanukha](https://x.com/israelifihther/status/1837535641690595627)
, som skrev:

– Israels siste offensiv mot Hizbollah påførte ikke bare fysisk skade, men er også et alvorlig slag for moralen og organisasjonens operative evne. Angrepet etterlot 5000 sårede og 500 i kritisk tilstand, hvorav mange sannsynligvis ikke vil overleve.

Tallene i innlegget er ikke den eneste overdrivelsen.

For ingen av de tre underkroppene på bildene har faktisk noe med personsøkerangrepet å gjøre.

Og hvis du søker etter fotografiene ved hjelp av Google Lens bildesøk, kan du enkelt finne to av dem.

En av dem har allerede blitt delt vidt og bredt i en helt annen sammenheng.

Bildet, der penis tydelig er borte, stammer faktisk fra den 65 år gamle ikke-binære amerikanske arkitekten [Lewin Wertheimer](https://x.com/lewinmodified_)
.

Han gjennomgikk en operasjon i april hvor penis ble fjernet og erstattet med en kunstig vagina, og etter operasjonen delte han stolt bildet på X, mens han holdt de fjernede testiklene i hendene.

  ![KJØNNSSKIFTE: Lewin Wartheimers innlegg på X 10. april 2024, hvor han nettopp har blitt operert. Foto: X / @lewinmodified](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063551.webp?imageId=17063551&x=0.00&y=0.00&cropw=100.00&croph=100.00&width=675&height=675 "Foto: X / @lewinmodified")

Bilde nummer to har heller ingenting med konflikten i Midtøsten å gjøre.  

Bildet av den bandasjerte penisen kommer faktisk fra en japansk profil på [X.](https://x.com/ayanetyaaaaaan/status/1189503012714057729)

Her skriver profilens eier, Ayane, i et innlegg fra 30. oktober 2019 at han hadde en ulykke med en kopp ramennudler og måtte til legen.

  ![SKADE: Innlegget med ramennudlene er fra 2019 og er illustrert av dette bildet. Foto: X / @ayanetyaaaaaan](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063620.webp?imageId=17063620&x=0.00&y=0.00&cropw=100.00&croph=100.00&width=675&height=912 "Foto: X / @ayanetyaaaaaan")

I den tredje underkroppen krever det litt mer innsats for å finne ut hvem personen er.

Et bildesøk gir bare et litt større utsnitt av det samme bildet, og her kan du se en mann som mangler både bein og høyre øye.

Hvis du oversetter den arabiske teksten på det større bildet, ser det ut til at mannen sannsynligvis heter Raja Awida.

Et søk på navnet hans fører til flere artikler i palestinske medier hvor man kan [se bilder](https://english.palinfo.com/Zionist-Terrorism/2024/09/13/325293/)
 av samme mann som mangler høyre øye og begge beina.

  ![FRA GAZA: Foto: Det fremgår av den arabiske teksten at bildet deles for å samle inn penger til en mann Raja Awida. Flere israelske kilder deler også dette bildet som dokumentasjon på skader etter personsøkerangrepet.

Og så kan du lese at han er offer for et israelsk bombeangrep i Gaza og derfor ikke offer for personsøkerangrepet.

Bildene av de påståtte skadene er et godt eksempel på at materiale er tatt ut av kontekst og misbrukt til å fortelle en helt annen historie.

En veldig stor del av de manipulerte historiene som vi i TV 2 Danmark har vært borti på sosiale medier det siste året er av den typen.

Men også kunstig intelligens begynner å bli involvert.

Den ødelagte basen
------------------

  ![KI-BILDE: Bildet her ble delt 23. september 2024, etter at Hizbollah utførte et rakettangrep mot Israel. Foto: X / @drhossamsamy65](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063718.webp?imageId=17063718&x=0.00&y=0.00&cropw=100.00&croph=100.00&width=675&height=743 "Foto: X / @drhossamsamy65")

KI-BILDE: Bildet her ble delt 23. september 2024, etter at Hizbollah utførte et rakettangrep mot Israel. Foto: X / @drhossamsamy65

22\. september 2024 ble Israel utsatt for et stort rakettangrep fra Hizbollah.

Like etterpå gikk bildet ovenfor viralt som «dokumentasjon» på at rakettene hadde forårsaket store skader på militærbasen Ramat David i den nordlige delen av landet.

Bildet ble delt av de propalestinske profilene på X [SilencedSirs](https://x.com/SilentlySirs/status/1837936858652725379)
 og [Dr. Sam Youssef](https://mobile.x.com/drhossamsamy65/status/1838022636841979974)
, og i skrivende stund er den sett over 500.000 ganger.

– Bilde fra Ramat David-basen i det okkuperte Palestina, etter at basen ble rammet av Hizbollahs angrep, skriver SilencedSirs i den medfølgende teksten til innlegget.

Ifølge Dr. Sam Youssef sier bildet ble lekket gjennom israelsk sensur, og ifølge ham beviser det at det er omfattende skader på basen.

Men hva beviser egentlig bildet?

Zoomer du inn, er det flere mistenkelige ting ved motivet.

Flyet har en mystisk pukkel nær haleroret, lastebilen til venstre har en enorm dør, og bilen nederst har to frontender.  

  ![FEIL: Bildet er fullt av tegn på at det ble generert av kunstig intelligens. X / @drhossamsamy65 Foto: X / @drhossamsamy65](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063728.webp?imageId=17063728&x=0.00&y=0.00&cropw=100.00&croph=100.00&width=675&height=783 "Foto: X / @drhossamsamy65")

FEIL: Bildet er fullt av tegn på at det ble generert av kunstig intelligens. X / @drhossamsamy65 Foto: X / @drhossamsamy65

Samtidig er det brennende flyet av en type som ikke eksisterer i virkeligheten, og det ser ut til å være satt sammen av et Hercules-fly og en Boeing 707.

Hvis du blar raskt forbi det falske bildet, kan det være vanskelig å se at det er fabrikkert, og de som ser det uten å ha mistanke om det, kan tro at Israel ble hardt rammet av angrepet fra Hizbollah, selv om bildet ikke dokumenterer noe i den retningen.

Bildet av det brennende flyet tilhører de mer sofistikerte AI-genererte bildene fra konflikten i Midtøsten.

Det brukes ofte mer upraktiske løsninger, hvor gamle bilder er forkledd som nye, eller hvor bildene kommer fra helt andre steder.

Dataspill fra Iran
------------------

  ![SPILL: Ifølge flere pro-iranske kilder på sosiale medier så oppskytingen av de mange missilene slik ut. Foto: Focus Home Interactive / TV 2 DK](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063730.webp?imageId=17063730&x=0.57&y=0.26&cropw=96.00&croph=95.97&width=675&height=905 "Foto: Focus Home Interactive / TV 2 DK")

SPILL: Ifølge flere pro-iranske kilder på sosiale medier så oppskytingen av de mange missilene slik ut. Foto: Focus Home Interactive / TV 2 DK

Israel ble utsatt for et stort luftangrep fra Iran om kvelden 1. oktober, med rundt 200 missiler som utfordret det israelske luftforsvaret, slik at flere av de iranske våpnene kunne slippe gjennom og treffe målene sine.

Under og etter angrepet ble det delt mange spektakulære bilder av missiler på himmelen over Israel – men hvordan så det ut da de ble skutt opp?

Det er spørsmålet den propalestinske X-profilen [Zainabzehra](https://mobile.x.com/ZAINABALI_72/status/1841182994595565706)
 prøvde å svare på til følgerne sine.

Profilen publiserte en video som i skrivende stund er sett 5,4 millioner ganger, og der den tilhørende teksten lyder:

– Iransk stats-TV har nettopp vist dette.

På bildene kan du se hundrevis av mobile utskytningsramper som sender ut så mange missiler at de nesten dekker himmelen.

Men zoomer man inn på de mobile rampene, viser det seg at det er gamle jugoslaviske kjøretøy, som i dag kun brukes av Bosnia, Serbia og Kroatia.

  ! <image:2151>

Hvordan havnet de i Iran?

Det har de ikke.

For når man ser nærmere på bilene, viser det seg at de ikke er ekte.

Bildene kommer faktisk fra dataspillet [Wargame: Red Dragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wargame:_Red_Dragon)
, utgitt av Focus Home Interactive i 2014.

En moské i brann
----------------

Noen av de fabrikkerte videoene og bildene som florerer på sosiale medier, deles ikke nødvendigvis for å lure folk, selv om de ser naturtro ut ved første øyekast.

13\. august [delte](https://x.com/TheTempleMoun/status/1823370869021831312)
 for eksempel den høyreekstreme israelske gruppen Sons of the Temple Mount en video som viser den muslimske helligdommen Al Aqsa-moskeen i flammer.

[https://twitter.com/TheTempleMoun/status/1823370869021831312](https://twitter.com/TheTempleMoun/status/1823370869021831312)

– Absolutt seier, heter det i den tilhørende teksten.

Heldigvis er det et [webkamera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niaaMHL3Mak)
 som peker direkte mot Al Aqsa-moskeen, så det er ganske enkelt å forsikre seg om at helligdommen fortsatt er der.  

Men intensjonen med den naturtro videoen, som ble laget med kunstig intelligens, var nok også annet enn å spre falske nyheter.

Nemlig å provosere.

Videoen har i skrivende stund kun blitt vist noen hundre ganger på gruppens egen profil på X, men til gjengjeld ble den raskt plukket opp av et stort antall palestinske profiler som raser mot den jødiske trusselen.

Videoen har blitt sett rundt 100.000 ganger på propalestinske profiler som [Eye on Palestine](https://x.com/EyeonPalestine/status/1834146323953574201)
, [DOA Muslims](https://x.com/doamuslims/status/1834198658570449027)
 samt den antisionistiske kanalen [Torah Judaism](https://x.com/TorahJudaism/status/1834245765624938637)
.

Og hvis formålet med videoen var å provosere, lyktes det.

For 15. september kunne den israelske avisen [Haaretz](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-09-15/ty-article/.premium/hamas-warns-grave-consequences-after-jewish-extremists-threaten-al-aqsa-mosque-in-video/00000191-f5e0-d570-ab95-fdedbd340000)
 fortelle at den palestinske terrorbevegelsen Hamas advarte om «alvorlige konsekvenser» på grunn av videobildene av den brennende moskeen.  

De «digitale» skyene
--------------------

Ett år inn i krigen er mengden manipulert informasjon i konflikten så alvorlig at selv relativt ubetydelig informasjon nå møtes med mistillit.

For eksempel etter Irans missilangrep mot Israel 1. oktober.

Her har israelerne i ettertid holdt informasjonen om hva iranerne traff tett inntil brystet.

Så langt har ikke Israels militære publisert noen bilder av mål som er truffet, og pressen har ikke tilgang til de berørte basene.

Derfor ventet lenestolekspertene på internett, som følger krigen tett, lenge på at det skulle komme nye satellittbilder etter angrepene.

Men da de kom, var det en skuffelse.

[Den anonyme X-profilen Ayden](https://x.com/squatsons/status/1841548683566821424)
 publiserte 2. oktober et satellittbilde av en av de israelske basene som var målet for det iranske angrepet, og her er det ikke mulig å se basen på grunn av skydekket.

[https://twitter.com/squatsons/status/1841548683566821424](https://twitter.com/squatsons/status/1841548683566821424)

Ayden publiserer sin egen analyse av materiale fra konfliktområder til sine 149.000 følgere, og profilens eier konkluderte med at skyene var digitalt plassert slik at publikum ikke kan se ettervirkningene av angrepet.

I skrivende stund har den oppsiktsvekkende påstanden blitt sett 1,7 millioner ganger på Aydens profil alene.

Påstanden ble også umiddelbart plukket opp av en rekke propalestinske [profiler](https://x.com/ShaykhSulaiman/status/1841533871587836034)
 som den britiske journalisten Sulaiman Ahmed, som delte det som et faktum med sine 598.000 følgere på X.

– Breaking. Israel legger falske digitale skyer over Nevatim-basen. De vil ikke at du skal se skadene, skrev han.

Det er imidlertid ingen indikasjoner på at satellittbildene har blitt manipulert.

Det var spredt skydekke over store deler av Israel de dagene de ble tatt.

  ![SKYDEKKE: Slik så det ut over Israel 1. oktober. Foto: Copernicus Sentinel data 2024 / TV 2 DK](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063801.webp?imageId=17063801&width=978&height=551 "Foto: Copernicus Sentinel data 2024 / TV 2 DK")

SKYDEKKE: Slik så det ut over Israel 1. oktober. Foto: Copernicus Sentinel data 2024 / TV 2 DK

På bildet med de «digitale skyene» kan man se en brå overgang mellom bakke- og skydekke, men dette er fordi bildet er en mosaikk bygd opp av bilder fra ulike satellittpasseringer til forskjellige tider.

Påstanden om at Israel utplasserte digitale skyer for å dekke over skadene varte ikke mer enn noen få dager, og det er nå offentlig tilgjengelige satellittbilder som viser skader og kratre i bakken ved den israelske basen.

, prompting the UN to war of an “imminent catastrophe” if the tit-for-tat violence continues.

Sirens were activated across northern Israel in the early hours of Sunday.

If confirmed, the assault would be Hezbollah’s farthest-reaching attack inside Israel since the start of the ongoing cross-border clashes in October last year.

The Israeli military said more than 100 projectiles were fired early on Sunday from Lebanon, forcing hundreds of thousands to take cover and prompting school closures in Israel’s north.

Educational activities would not be permitted across northern Israel until at least Monday at 6pm (15:00 GMT), the military’s Home Front Command said, affecting “hundreds of thousands of children”, according to military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Nadav Shoshani.

“In Haifa, a lot of schools are closed … and offices are empty,” said resident Patrice Wolff, who works in the medical industry.

The Israeli military also issued restrictions on large gatherings in northern Israel, including Haifa – the country’s third-largest city.

There were no reports of casualties or any significant damage by rockets in Israel on Sunday.

On Saturday, the Israeli army said it carried out hundreds of air raids across southern Lebanon. It also claimed attacks on 110 other locations in the early hours of Sunday morning.

In a statement issued by his office on Sunday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged that Israel “inflicted a series of blows” against Hezbollah.

“If Hezbollah has not understood the message, I promise you, it will understand the message.”

Meanwhile, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant vowed that Israeli operations against Hezbollah will continue until residents of northern Israel can return home safely.

‘Imminent catastrophe’
----------------------

The latest violence could lead to an “imminent catastrophe” in the Middle East, the United Nations special coordinator for Lebanon, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, warned on Sunday, saying a military solution was not the answer.

“With the region on the brink of an imminent catastrophe, it cannot be overstated enough: there is NO military solution that will make either side safer,” she said in a post on X.

Reporting from Beirut, Al Jazeera’s Ali Hashem also highlighted the significance of the Lebanese group’s attack.

“This is the first time since the 2006 war \[between Israel and Hezbollah\] that Hezbollah’s missiles crossed” 20km (12 miles), Hashem said.

“This is the first time that they’re hitting targets towards 45km \[30 miles\], 50km \[31 miles\], because we’re hearing reports of impacts or interceptions in several areas, including above the Ramat David Airbase to the east of Haifa.”

Al Jazeera’s Zeina Khodr, also reporting from Beirut, said Hezbollah’s message is that despite the blows that they have received in the past few days, “it’s still able to fight and launch rockets and missiles across the border”.

In its statement, Hezbollah said it carried out the attack with so-called Fadi 1 and Fadi 2 rockets, not the World War II era, Soviet-made Katyusha rockets that it has been using over the past several months.

The latest barrage of rocket fire comes after a week of Israeli attacks across Lebanon.

On Tuesday and Wednesday, wireless [communication devices](/news/2024/9/18/chk_exploding-pagers-psychological-warfare-israels-attack-on-hezbollah)
 associated with Hezbollah exploded across Lebanon, injuring thousands and killing dozens, including civilians. Hezbollah has said it is not seeking an all-out war, but it is ready for one should it occur.

Israeli leaders have promised to push Hezbollah off Israel’s border and return its citizens to communities in the north, including through war if necessary.

Death toll in Beirut strike rises
---------------------------------

Israel also conducted an air strike in the southern suburbs of Beirut on Friday that [killed at least 45 people](/news/2024/9/21/death-toll-from-israeli-strike-on-beirut-suburb-rises-to-31)
 and injured dozens more.

Senior Hezbollah commander Ibrahim Aqil was among those killed in the attack that levelled an entire residential building.

Hezbollah and Israel have engaged in daily clashes since the outbreak of the Israeli war on Gaza.

The Lebanese group says it will continue its attacks on Israeli bases in the north of the country until Israel ends its Gaza offensive.

The violence has displaced tens of thousands of people on both sides of the border.

Hezbollah launched dozens of rockets at an Israeli military base in the northern region of the country on Sunday, as Israel and the militant group continue to exchange fire amid escalating tensions in the Middle East.

The militant group said the attack, which targeted the Ramat David airbase, near the northern city of Haifa, was “in response to the [repeated Israeli attacks](https://www.politico.eu/article/senior-hezbollah-commander-killed-in-israeli-strike-on-beirut/)
 that targeted various Lebanese regions and led to the fall of many civilian martyrs," the Associated Press [reported](https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-rocket-attack-mideast-tensions-0584727974096d98d1b5b132dfd1d218)
.

"We have entered a new phase, the title of which is the [open-ended battle of reckoning](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/hezbollah-israel-exchange-heavy-fire-after-deadly-israeli-strike-2024-09-22/)
," Hezbollah deputy chief Naim Qassem said on Sunday.

Israel Defense Forces [confirmed](https://x.com/IDF/status/1837680273405702296)
 on social media that "large areas of northern Israel are being targeted by Hezbollah’s rockets." It was unclear whether there were any casualties.

The attack came after a massive Israeli air strike on the Lebanese capital Beirut [killed](https://www.politico.eu/article/senior-hezbollah-commander-killed-in-israeli-strike-on-beirut/)
 at least 37 people on Friday, including a top Hezbollah military commander.

These missile and rockets exchanges are just [the latest escalations](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/20/israel-hezbollah-escalation-00180299)
 in the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah militants, which are fanning fears of a wider war in the region. Israel earlier [said](https://x.com/IDF/status/1837501170182483984)
 it launched a series of airstrikes targeting Hezbollah missile launchers in southern Lebanon.

"In recent days, we have inflicted a [series of blows](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/netanyahu-examining-siege-plan-hamas-north-gaza-israeli-media-report-2024-09-22/)
 on Hezbollah that it never imagined," Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a [video statement](https://x.com/netanyahu/status/1837815933340971071)
 on Sunday. "If Hezbollah has not understood the message, I promise you, it will [understand the message](https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-says-hezbollah-will-get-the-message-after-strikes-it-never-imagined/)
."

Hezbollah last week [blamed](https://www.politico.eu/article/lebanon-hezbollah-injured-by-exploding-pagers/)
 Israel for two waves of attacks where the explosion of [pagers](https://www.politico.eu/article/lebanon-hezbollah-injured-by-exploding-pagers/)
 and other [communications devices](https://www.politico.eu/article/lebanon-second-wave-tech-pager-explosions-beirut-nabatieh-tyre-saida/)

===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim states that the image depicts the Israeli Air Force's Ramat David airbase after an attack by Hezbollah on September 22, 2024. While news reports confirm that Hezbollah claimed to have launched rockets at the airbase on that date, the provided search results do not include any images of the attack. The image search did not provide any information about the image.

Since there is no evidence to confirm the image's authenticity, the claim is marked as `not enough information`.

**What are the targets struck?**

An important target of Hezbollah's retaliatory strike on Sunday morning was Ramat David Airbase, located 15 km southeast of occupied Haifa, the northernmost base for Israeli fighter jets.

The airbase also hosts combat, transport, rescue and maritime patrol helicopters, reconnaissance and combat drones, as well as electronic warfare offensive systems.

Hezbollah's footage released in July showed that its spy drones flew to the base, 46 km far from the Lebanese border, and examined its layout and other details.

The airbase has three runways, which, together with hangars, training and other facilities, cover an area of ​​six square kilometers, and as in the previous case and for the same reasons, it is currently not possible to determine the exact damage.

The airbase and the nearby military airport were pounded at least three times on Sunday “in support of our steadfast Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip,” said the Hezbollah statement.

Another target was the Rafael industrial complex that houses weapons manufacturing plants.

As correctly reported by the [Press TV website](https://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2024/08/15/731412/Israel-Haifa-Iran-retaliation)
 last month, while discussing options before the Axis of Resistance to retaliate against the assassination of resistance commanders Ismail Haniyeh and Fuad Shukr, one of the primary targets was the Rafael industrial complex in occupied Haifa.

The 'Rafael Advanced Defense Systems complex covers six square kilometers along the Mediterranean coast north of the city and is a strictly protected zone, with a fence and guardhouses.

It consists of over a hundred buildings, from office and research centers, and warehouses, to industrial plants, test ranges and military installations.

Rafael is one of the regime's three largest military manufacturing companies, producing protection systems for armored vehicles, the Iron Dome and David's Sling air military systems, and various types of cruise and guided missiles.

To the north and east of the Rafael complex are industrial zones of other arms companies, while just 50 meters to the south, across Jerusalem Boulevard, is a densely populated residential zone.

The damage done in the complex is not known due to the secrecy and inaccessibility of the location, as well as due to the regime's long-term policy of hiding and censoring the damage in the military areas and exaggerating the damage in the residential areas.

Israeli regime media thus does not report military-industrial damage in the complex and claims that Hezbollah rockets intentionally hit the houses of Kiryat Bialik, a nearby residential neighborhood located across Highway 4 to the east.

Taking into account the stated CEP of the rockets and the width of the complex of 1.5 kilometers, the regime's claims about the deliberate targeting of civilian areas are highly unlikely.

This is supported by footage of one of the hits from the Israeli media, whose explosion is more in line with a failed interceptor missile of the Iron Dome system than a rocket with a 150 kg warhead.

The photos they released show damage to houses, cars and roads, as well as a number of local fires, and according to their reports, three people have been injured.

Explainer: How Hezbollah struck Ramat David airbase and Rafael arms factory in Haifa?
=====================================================================================

**What weapons were used?**

Lebanese media quoted sources on the ground saying that Fadi-1 and Fadi-2 artillery rockets were used in the waves of attacks for the first time since the beginning of the Israeli genocidal war on Gaza.

Both models are large-caliber and long-range artillery rockets, significantly larger and more effective than the BM-21 Grad rocket variants of the Katyusha family that make up the bulk of Hezbollah's rocket artillery arsenal.

They are launched from a multiple rocket launcher (MRL), with platforms configured from three to six barrels, usually hidden and camouflaged underground or in well-fortified bunkers.

In this particular case, the rockets were launched from dozens of Hezbollah underground bases of the Imad Complex, which houses MRLs and personnel and, according to the field sources, have "not been affected by all of the enemies' raids."

The Fadi-1 is a 220 mm rocket with a range of 80 km, and the larger Fadi-2 is a 302 mm rocket with a range of 105 km and a warhead of 150 kg.

The former is similar in caliber to the Russian BM-27 Uragan and TOS-1A rockets, but with a greater range, while the latter is similar in caliber and range to the Chinese Weishi-1, Syrian Khaibar-1 and Turkish TRG-300 rockets.

The BM-21 Katyusha is a 122 mm rocket with a range of 40 km and quantitatively represents the largest part of Hezbollah's colossal arsenal of about 150,000 rockets.

With a circular error probability (CEP) of several tens of meters, all three artillery rockets do not have precision guidance and are used to strike large-area targets, such as the Ramat David airbase and the Rafael industrial plant in Saturday’s case.

Lebanese field sources emphasize that this attack did not include the use of precision-guided missiles, which Hezbollah possesses, and was only a preliminary response to Israeli aggression.

**By Ivan Kesic**

**In the initial response to the assassination of its top-ranking commanders, the Lebanese resistance movement launched its deepest strike into occupied territories since October 7.**

In the wee hours of Monday morning, the movement launched a barrage of Fadi-1 and Fadi-2 rockets targeting the Ramat David airbase and military airport southeast of the occupied city of Haifa.

The initial burst of rockets was followed by two more intense bursts within a few hours, forcing Israeli soldiers and settlers to hide in safe rooms, as confirmed by the regime media.

The attacks followed the assassination of Aqil and other senior Hezbollah officials in an Israeli airstrike in the southern suburbs of Beirut. He is the second high-profile Hezbollah leader to be targeted in recent months after Fuad Shukr.

The attacks on Ramat David airbase and airport, which evaded Israeli air defenses, were followed by a high-precision strike on the Rafael arms manufacturing firm near Haifa.

In a statement, Hezbollah said the operation was the “initial reaction” to the terror attacks on Tuesday and Wednesday that killed dozens and injured thousands across Lebanon.

From [Source](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-september-22-2024): 
Content: The Institute for the Study of War and Critical Threats Project published a map showing the location of the attacks into Northern Israel from Lebanon as of September 22, 2024. <image:2186> The map indicates that Lebanese Hezbollah conducted a three-wave rocket attack targeting an IDF airbase near Haifa.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Hezbollah conducted a three-wave rocket attack targeting an IDF airbase near Haifa on September 22, 2024. The Institute for the Study of War and Critical Threats Project published a map showing the location of the attacks. However, the provided evidence does not include any images of the attack. Therefore, the authenticity of the image cannot be verified.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2024/09/22/733773/explainer-hezbollah-struck-ramat-david-airbase-rafael-arms-factory-haifa): 
Content: The Press TV website reports that Hezbollah launched a barrage of Fadi-1 and Fadi-2 rockets targeting the Ramat David airbase and military airport southeast of Haifa on September 22, 2024. The article mentions that the airbase has three runways and covers an area of six square kilometers. The article also mentions that the attacks followed the assassination of Aqil and other senior Hezbollah officials in an Israeli airstrike in the southern suburbs of Beirut. The article includes images <image:2202>, <image:2211>, <image:2213>, <image:2214>, <image:2216>.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Hezbollah launched rockets at the Ramat David airbase on September 22, 2024. However, the provided search results do not include the image in the claim. Therefore, the authenticity of the image cannot be verified.


## Final Judgement
The claim is that the image depicts the Ramat David airbase after an attack by Hezbollah on September 22, 2024. While there is evidence of an attack on the airbase on that date, the image has not been verified. Therefore, the claim is `not enough information`.

## Summary

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:50> This image shows Israel's 9/11 memorial which is the only one outside the US."

## Actions
```
web_search("Israel 9/11 memorial")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The 9/11 Living Memorial Plaza in Jerusalem, Israel, designed by Eliezer Weishoff, is dedicated to the victims of the September 11 attacks. The memorial features a bronze sculpture of an American flag morphing into a flame and includes a remnant from the Twin Towers. The memorial was dedicated on November 12, 2009.

The memorial is located in Jerusalem Park and commemorates the nearly 3000 people who perished in the disaster, including five Israelis.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the image depicts the 9/11 Living Memorial Plaza in Jerusalem, Israel, which is dedicated to the victims of the September 11 attacks. The memorial includes a bronze sculpture of an American flag morphing into a flame.

The evidence does not explicitly state that this is the only 9/11 memorial outside the US. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified.

To verify the claim, information about other 9/11 memorials outside the US is needed.

10th anniversary memorial services
----------------------------------

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Memorials_and_services_for_the_September_11_attacks&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: 10th anniversary memorial services")\
\]

Many organizations held memorial services and events for the 10th anniversary of the attacks.

*   The official New York City observance of the 10th anniversary of September 11 took place at the World Trade Center site at 8:40 am – 12:30 pm Sunday, September 11, 2011. Hundreds of citizens assembled during the remembrance ceremony held for the Tenth Anniversary on Sunday, September 11.

20th anniversary memorial services

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Memorials_and_services_for_the_September_11_attacks&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: 20th anniversary memorial services")\
\]

The 20th anniversary came just weeks after a hastened [withdrawal of United States troops from Afghanistan](/wiki/Withdrawal_of_United_States_troops_from_Afghanistan_(2020%E2%80%932021) "Withdrawal of United States troops from Afghanistan (2020–2021)")
 following the [2021 Taliban offensive](/wiki/2021_Taliban_offensive "2021 Taliban offensive")
 in which the [Taliban](/wiki/Taliban "Taliban")
 reconquered most of Afghanistan. We have built this memorial because, to be blunt, the world needed it done years ago, and the two years longer to await the completion of the _Reflected Absence_ memorial in New York city (by Michael Arad and Peter Walker) was in our opinion two years too long.[\[118\]](#cite_note-sl-crnyc-ann-118)

*   World Trade Center Memorial (_Second Life_)[\[119\]](#cite_note-sl-wtcm-119)
     is focused on the victims of 9/11, reminiscent of the Memorial Wall of the [Vietnam Veterans Memorial](/wiki/Vietnam_Veterans_Memorial "Vietnam Veterans Memorial")

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:50> This image shows Israel's 9/11 memorial which is the only one outside the US."

## Actions

```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The 9/11 Living Memorial Plaza in Jerusalem, Israel, designed by Eliezer Weishoff, is dedicated to the victims of the September 11 attacks. The memorial features a bronze sculpture of an American flag morphing into a flame and includes a remnant from the Twin Towers. The memorial was dedicated on November 12, 2009.

The memorial is located in Jerusalem Park and commemorates the nearly 3000 people who perished in the disaster, including five Israelis.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the image depicts the 9/11 Living Memorial Plaza in Jerusalem, Israel, which is dedicated to the victims of the September 11 attacks. The memorial includes a bronze sculpture of an American flag morphing into a flame.

The evidence does not explicitly state that this is the only 9/11 memorial outside the US. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified.

To verify the claim, information about other 9/11 memorials outside the US is needed.

    The Municipal Art Society of New York and Creative Time’s installation of 88 searchlights—conceived by John Bennett, Gustavo Bonevardi, Richard Nash Gould, Julian Laverdiere, and Paul Myoda with lighting consultant Paul Marantz—initially ran from March 11 through April 14, 2002, to mark the six-month anniversary of the attacks. “Obviously the deceased are not going to experience any of this but it needs to carry your memories of them.”

Following the tragic events on September 11, 2001, many cities, both in the US and abroad, built memorials for the victims, survivors, and first responders."

A [post](https://archive.ph/LKIoV)
 shared on Threads with an image purportedly of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s home, taken by a Hezbollah drone in August 2024, is MISSING CONTEXT.

The post reads, “BREAKING Netanyahu’s residence in Caesarea has been filmed by a drone belonging to the Lebanese Hezbollah — Israel Hayom.”

The image was also shared on X (formerly Twitter) with similar claims in a [post](https://archive.ph/7EBDu)
 reading, “Netanyahu’s residence has been filmed by a Hezbollah drone…On target.”

According to media [reports](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/hezbollah-drone-suspected-of-filming-netanyahus-home-report/3307013)
, a suspected [Hezbollah](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/what-hezbollah)
 drone that was purportedly filming Netanyahu’s home in Caesarea on 18 August 2024 was dismissed as a false alarm. The Lebanese militant group allied with [Hamas](https://apnews.com/article/hamas-hezbollah-houthis-iran-militant-groups-745bfc36e23997ee3f0bc499a9f5c16d)

 war in the Middle East.

A Google Lens reverse image [search](https://archive.ph/BOoER)
 established the image in question predates current events.

The image was featured in a 25 June 2020 [article](https://www.timesofisrael.com/why-exactly-have-israelis-been-ordered-to-pay-netanyahus-taxes/)
 by _Times of Israel_ with the headline, “Why, exactly, have Israelis been ordered to pay Netanyahu’s taxes?”

The image, labelled as a screenshot, is attributed to _Kan_ public broadcaster and captioned: “Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s private residence in Caesarea.”

_KAN_ featured the image in a YouTube [video](https://youtu.be/k_VMJvSd8v0)
 uploaded on 1 July 2019.

The video’s title, translated from Hebrew, reads, “The villa in Caesarea: The Netanyahu family insists that the state finance the sealing works.”

Claim: "<image:53> This image shows Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu's house taken by a Hezbollah drone in August 2024."

## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:53>)
reverse_search(<image:53>)
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.17, 'Mexico': 0.15, 'Tunisia': 0.11, 'Malta': 0.1, 'Palestine': 0.07, 'Bermuda': 0.05, 'Jordan': 0.05, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.04, 'Dominican Republic': 0.03, 'Pakistan': 0.03}

### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (<image:53>) shows Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's private residence in Caesarea. The image is from 2019 and was featured in a June 25, 2020 article by _Times of Israel_. The image is attributed to _Kan_ public broadcaster.

The image was also found on PesaCheck, which published an article on August 28, 2024. The Times of Israel published an article about the Prime Minister's Residence, but the image is not included in the article. The article mentions a Hezbollah attack on the PM's home in October 2024.


# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is not accurate. The image is of Benjamin Netanyahu's private residence in Caesarea, but it was taken in 2019, not in August 2024. The image was featured in a _Times of Israel_ article from June 25, 2020. The evidence also mentions a Hezbollah attack on the PM's home in October 2024, which does not align with the claim's timeframe.

1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.



## Decision Options
* `misleading`: The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the claim or image is misrepresented in a wrong context or the necessary context is omitted. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way. If the claim refers to an image, it misrepresents the origin, content and/or meaning of the image.If the claim is a text-only claim, i.e. it does not refer to an image, it misrepresents the origin, content, and/or meaning of a statement.
* `not enough information`: The claim is marked as NEI when there is not enough evidence to verify the claim or if the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory. 
* `false`: The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:53> This image shows Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu's house taken by a Hezbollah drone in August 2024."

## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:53>)
reverse_search(<image:53>)
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.17, 'Mexico': 0.15, 'Tunisia': 0.11, 'Malta': 0.1, 'Palestine': 0.07, 'Bermuda': 0.05, 'Jordan': 0.05, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.04, 'Dominican Republic': 0.03, 'Pakistan': 0.03}

### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (<image:53>) shows Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's private residence in Caesarea. The image is from 2019 and was featured in a June 25, 2020 article by _Times of Israel_. The image is attributed to _Kan_ public broadcaster.

The image was also found on PesaCheck, which published an article on August 28, 2024. The Times of Israel published an article about the Prime Minister's Residence, but the image is not included in the article. The article mentions a Hezbollah attack on the PM's home in October 2024.


## Elaboration
The claim is not accurate. The image is of Benjamin Netanyahu's private residence in Caesarea, but it was taken in 2019, not in August 2024. The image was featured in a _Times of Israel_ article from June 25, 2020. The evidence also mentions a Hezbollah attack on the PM's home in October 2024, which does not align with the claim's timeframe.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image is of Benjamin Netanyahu's private residence, but it was taken in 2019, not in August 2024. The claim also states that the image was taken by a Hezbollah drone, which is not supported by the evidence.

A [photo published on X](https://archive.is/0PvDl)
 (formerly Twitter) claiming to show Israeli Prime Minister (PM) Benjamin Netanyahu being surveilled by Iran from inside his office is ALTERED.

The post alleges that Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) captured and published the image, accompanied by a warning reading, “Do not test our capabilities — we intend to keep you living in a state of constant anxiety!”

However, a reverse image search revealed that the photo has [been online](https://archive.is/JmjZG)
 since 2019 and was not shared by IRGC in 2025, as the post claims.

Furthermore, a Yandex image search showed that the photo was [edited](https://www.malumatfurus.org/netanyahu-makam-odasi/)
 to make it appear as though Netanyahu was under surveillance. The [original image](https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/in-this-handout-photo-benjamin-netanyahu-head-of-the-right-news-photo/84719768?adppopup=true)
, taken on 8 February 2009, in Jerusalem, shows Netanyahu with his father, Ben Zion Netanyahu.

A FotoForensics Error Level Analysis (ELA) reveals that the photo has been altered, as indicated by inconsistencies and noise in the image.

PesaCheck has looked into a photo on X (formerly Twitter) claiming to show Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu being surveilled by Iran from inside his office and finds it to have been ALTERED.

A spokesperson for Prime Minster Benjamin Netanyahu’s office confirmed to media outlets on Monday for the first time that Israel was behind a string of devastating attacks on Hezbollah communications devices in September.

During a cabinet meeting on Sunday, Netanyahu reportedly boasted that Israel was behind the attacks, but while the Jewish state was widely believed to have been responsible, there had been no official confirmation from the government or military until spokesman Omer Dostri’s statement on Monday.

[On September 17, thousands of pagers simultaneously exploded](https://www.timesofisrael.com/several-killed-thousands-hurt-as-wave-of-pager-explosions-strikes-hezbollah/)
 in the southern suburbs of Beirut and other Hezbollah strongholds across Lebanon.

The coordinated attack dealt a deadly blow to the Iran-backed Lebanese terror group, and kicked off an escalation that continued with the assassination of almost all of Hezbollah’s leadership, including Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah, and a limited Israeli ground invasion of southern Lebanon.

A Hezbollah official, speaking on condition of anonymity, had said the incident was the “biggest security breach” for the group in nearly a year of conflict with Israel.

Netanyahu reportedly claimed to cabinet ministers on Sunday that senior defense officials and political figures were opposed to the detonation of the pagers but that he went ahead with the operation.

“The pager operation and the elimination of \[Hezbollah leader Hassan\] Nasrallah were carried out despite the opposition of senior officials in the defense establishment and those responsible for them in the political echelon,” he reportedly said, in a clear dig at recently fired defense minister Yoav Gallant.

The pager explosions occurred after almost a year of incessant rocket and drone attacks on Israel by the Hezbollah terror group, which began a day after Hamas’s October 7, 2023, massacre and led to the evacuation of some 60,000 residents from northern Israel towns on the border with Lebanon.

![Ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon begins](<Base64-Image-Removed>)

Josh Einiger has details on the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hezbollah.

LONDON -- Israel's cabinet has approved the U.S.-backed ceasefire proposal between Israel and Hezbollah after prolonged negotiations.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had submitted the proposal to the cabinet for approval Tuesday evening local time. local time, Biden said.

"Israel appreciates the US contribution to the process, and reserves its right to act against any threat to its security," the Israeli Prime Minister's Office said, translated from Hebrew.

Netanyahu said earlier, when submitting the deal for approval, that the deal still relies on the actions of Hezbollah.

"The duration of the ceasefire depends on what happens in Lebanon," Netanyahu said in a statement. We will continue together until victory."

The prime minister hailed "great achievements" on all fronts of the war, including killing Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and destroying their weapons across the country.

"With full understanding with the United States, we maintain complete military freedom of action," Netanyahu said in the address, translated from Hebrew. If it launches a rocket, if it digs a tunnel, if it brings in a truck with missiles -- we will attack."

Netanyahu attended a meeting with security officials on Sunday night regarding a ceasefire with Israel's Hezbollah adversaries in Lebanon, an Israeli official told ABC News.

This was part of ongoing talks, including Netanyahu's meeting last week in Israel with U.S. Hochstein also traveled to Beirut to discuss a potential way forward.

Netanyahu then held a security cabinet meeting on Tuesday morning to discuss the deal and hold a cabinet vote, Israeli officials said.

In October, Israel invaded southern Lebanon in an escalation of the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Hezbollah militant group.

Tensions heightened last weekend as the countries' leaders worked to negotiate a ceasefire deal. "If Hezbollah violates the agreement and tries to arm itself -- we will attack. On Sunday, Hezbollah fired about 250 rockets and other projectiles into Israel in one of the group's heaviest retaliations in months.

| **"From Commander to Ghost: Qaani’s Great Escape?"**  <br>  <br>  <br><br>> The X post by @MOSSADil  <br>> juxtaposes two images of Esmail Qaani, commander of Iran's IRGC Quds Force, showing him in official military attire and later in civilian disguise, hinting at an escape or survival tactic following reported Israeli airstrikes in June 2025, which The New York Times claimed killed him—yet his reappearance challenges that narrative.  <br>>   <br>> Historical context reveals Qaani’s role expanded after Qasem Soleimani’s 2020 assassination, with him overseeing extraterritorial operations and financial support to groups like Hezbollah, making him a high-value target; his survival suggests advanced evasion strategies, possibly informed by Iran’s experience with past Mossad operations.  <br>>   <br>> No peer-reviewed studies directly address this event, but intelligence analysis from sources like the Institute for National Security Studies indicates Israel’s use of AI and drones in recent strikes, implying Qaani’s escape may reflect counterintelligence adaptations to such technology, a development not yet widely acknowledged in mainstream reports.  <br>>   <br><br>[https://x.com/MOSSADil/status/1937910103413305647?t=U-jJJCUJfAiMFHTQUo7QSw&s=08](https://x.com/MOSSADil/status/1937910103413305647?t=U-jJJCUJfAiMFHTQUo7QSw&s=08)<br><br>**2 Likes**<br><br>([Share⤴](#)<br>)<br><br>*   ![](/static/copypost.svg/3)Copy Post<br><br>* * *<br><br>*   ![](/static/whatsapp.svg/3)WhatsApp<br><br>* * *<br><br>*   ![](/static/telegram.svg/3)Telegram<br><br>* * *<br><br>*   ![](/static/twitter.svg/3)Twitter<br><br>* * *<br><br>*   ![](/static/facebook.svg/3)Facebook<br><br>![](https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/19372980_screenshot20250626135815x_jpeg6f297ae460a3af6b763a91ab2860e060)<br><br>![](https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/19372981_20250626135822_jpegc08e73ef887b6ca54a330b84be6c0905)<br><br>![](https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/19372982_20250626135825_jpeg180b82528e58725485b2e7c2d1d64386)<br><br>![](https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/19372983_20250626135832_jpegdff47f83bbe7b7ca12d42dcd0cbca00f) |

| ![cool](https://www.nairaland.com/faces/cool.png) I honestly think Iran needs to carry a DNA test on this guy ...To be sure he is truly Iranian..was looking for this post today, wonder why he keeps showing up in my mind eyes ... There's nothing like ghosting, you either have information or you do not ...  <br>  <br>I think Nigeria should learn from Iran and have a redundant command system, Incase all the Generals are deceived into a bunker. Core personnel should avoid the limelight.. I also know telecommunications can be intercepted and cloned to look like the real person was talking no one believed me.

Rumors that Ismail Qaani, the former commander of Iran’s [Quds Force](https://www.jfeed.com/tags/iran "Quds Force")
, might be a spy for [Israel’s Mossad](https://www.jfeed.com/middleeast/iran-executes-alleged-israeli-spies " Israel’s Mossad")
 have circulated widely, particularly in recent months. These claims gained traction after Qaani’s sudden disappearance following an Israeli airstrike in Beirut on October 4, 2024, targeting Hezbollah’s [Hashem Safieddine](https://www.jfeed.com/tags/spmgxi "Hashem Safieddine")
, whom Qaani was supposed to meet. His absence, coupled with Israel’s successful strikes against high-profile Iranian and Hezbollah figures, sparked intense speculation about his loyalty.

Reports from outlets like The Sun, Middle East Eye, and Hindustan Times in October 2024 suggested that Iranian authorities placed Qaani under house arrest and interrogated him, suspecting he leaked critical intelligence that enabled Israel to pinpoint targets, including the assassinations of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah on September 27, 2024, and Safieddine.

Some sources claimed he suffered a heart attack during questioning, adding to the drama. A Middle East Eye source alleged the “breach was 100 percent Iranian,” hinting at internal compromise, though no hard evidence was provided.

Iranian officials, including an [IRGC](https://www.jfeed.com/tags/irgc "IRGC")
 adviser and [Quds Force](https://www.jfeed.com/tags/quds-force "Quds Force")
 deputy Iraj Masjedi, countered these rumors, asserting Qaani was in “perfect health” and even slated for a military honor from Ayatollah Khamenei. Posts on X have amplified the theory, with some users jokingly or seriously suggesting Qaani was an Israeli asset who fed intelligence leading to the deaths of Nasrallah, Safieddine, and even himself, reportedly killed in an Israeli airstrike on June 13, 2025, per The New York Times.

Critically, the establishment narrative, pushed by Iranian denials and Israeli silence, leans toward dismissing these rumors as propaganda or internal power plays within Iran’s security apparatus. Qaani’s reported death in June 2025 complicates the story further, leaving the spy allegations as unproven speculation, possibly a mix of disinformation and genuine suspicion amid a shadow war where truth is a casualty.

Have you noticed that the Quds Force commander, Ismail Qaani, is one of the only senior figures still alive and untouched?

As a reminder: about six months ago, a strong rumor spread that he was a Mossad agent, after he went off the radar for several days following the Dahieh bombing in Beirut."

The commander of [Iran's Quds Force](https://www.newarab.com/news/after-irans-rockets-hit-israel-commits-massacres-gaza)
 Esmail Qaani is in "good health", the unit's deputy commander said Monday, following claims he had possibly been assassinated by Israel

Iraj Masjedi said Qaani, who heads the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps' (IRGC) expeditionary force was safe and no further statement on the issue is needed.

It follows comments made by two senior Iranian security officials on Sunday that Qaani had not been heard from since a huge wave of Israeli airstrikes on Beirut late last week, which is believed to have killed senior Hezbollah and Iranian commanders.

Qaani traveled to Lebanon after an Israeli air strike killed [Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah](https://www.newarab.com/news/israel-military-says-hezbollah-chief-nasrallah-eliminated)
 and IRGC top general Abbas Nilforoushan in Beirut.

Contact with Nasrallah's replacement Hashem Safieddine has also been reportedly lost, with fears in the group that he could have been targeted and killed also in the strikes, which have resulted in hundreds of civilians killed.

On Tuesday, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps [fired some 200 missiles](https://www.newarab.com/news/irans-khamenei-says-iran-missile-attack-israel-legitimate)
 at Israel in retaliation for the killings of the leaders. 

It was Iran's second direct attack on Israel in six months, after a missile and drone assault in April in retaliation for a deadly strike on Iran's consulate in Damascus, which Tehran blamed on Israel.

Tehran named Qaani the head of the Revolutionary Guards Corps' overseas force after US President Donald Trump ordered the assassination of [Qassem Soleimani](https://www.newarab.com/video/twin-blast-kills-dozens-irans-qassem-soleimani-memorial)
 in a drone strike in Baghdad in 2020.

Part of Qaani's task in that post has been to manage Tehran's paramilitary allies across the Middle East, as well as in other regions around the world, who have been key pillars of support for Iran's axis allies in the region, including Syrian dictator Bashar Al-Assad.

These groups have been heavily targeted by Israeli forces in recent months, including the Hashd Al-Shaabi in Iraq, the [Houthis of Yemen](https://www.newarab.com/news/official-denies-us-offered-recognise-houthi-sanaa-government)
, and Iranian-led Shia militias in Syria.

When Qaani took over the force after deputising Soleimani for over two decades, he vowed to boot US forces out of the Middle East in revenge for Soleimani's killing.

"We promise to continue martyr Soleimani's path with the same force ... and the only compensation for us would be to remove America from the region," state radio quoted Qaani as saying ahead of Soleimani's funeral in Tehran.

Qaani, 67, was born in Mashhad, a conservative Shia Muslim religious city in northeastern Iran. He fought for the Revolutionary Guards during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, and has experience in overseas operations beyond Iran's eastern borders, including Afghanistan and Pakistan.

He does not speak Arabic, unlike Soleimani who spoke fluently with Iraqi militias and Hezbollah commanders.

He has adopted less of a public persona than Soleimani and little information is available on him online or in leaked diplomatic cables.

Unlike Soleimani, who over the years was widely photographed on battlefields in Iraq and Syria alongside the militias Tehran has armed and trained, Qaani has preferred to keep a lower profile and conduct most of his meetings and visits to neighbouring countries in private. 

He has adopted a low public profile compared to Soleimani - who was seen as a daring, down-to-earth, and charismatic figure - and little information is available on him online or in leaked diplomatic cables.

The Nairaland forum post and JFeed articles discuss the image in the context of Qaani's movements and potential threats.

Open Extended Reactions

PARIS -- The International Judo Federation will launch an investigation into why Algeria's Messaoud Redouane Dris failed his weigh-in before a bout with Israel's Tohar Butbul -- which could be part of a pattern of sportsmanship issues.

An IJF spokesperson told ESPN those questions would be answered in due time. "Unfortunately, athletes often become victims of broader political disputes which are against the values of sport."

The Algerian federation did not immediately respond to comment when contacted by ESPN.

"I think the Algerian athletes and all the Muslim athletes cannot go to the fight with Israeli athletes," Butbul told reporters. At the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, four judoka athletes failed weigh-ins. Of Israel's 88 athletes at the Olympics, 12 compete in judo. Dris' disqualification marked the third time an opponent has not faced Butbul over the past two Olympics.

"We believe that sport should remain a realm of integrity and fairness, free from the influences of international conflicts," the IJF said in a statement. However, this isn't the first incident involving controversy and Israeli athletes in the sport. On Sunday, both Abderrahmane Boushita of Morocco and Nurali Emomali of Tajikistan refused to shake the hand of Israel's Baruch Shmailov in the under-66kg event.

In Tokyo, another Algerian, Fethi Nourine withdrew from the Olympics to avoid a potential fight against Butbul in the second round. However French President Emmanuel Macron said ahead of the Games that Israeli athletes were welcome in France, and the interior minister ordered increased 24-hour security for the Israeli Olympians days before the opening ceremony. The investigation is expected to take place at the conclusion of the Olympics, and the federation said further action will be taken if needed. They won't let them compete, even though they are athletes."

Algerian judoka investigated after failing to make weight for bout with Israeli
===============================================================================

This article is more than 11 months old

*   Messaoud Redouane Dris’s actions labelled ‘a disgrace’
*   Fears athletes can become ‘victims of political disputes’

Judo’s governing body is to investigate why Algeria’s Messaoud Redouane Dris failed the weigh-in for his -73kg bout with Israel’s Tohar Butbul at the Paris Olympics, saying athletes can become “victims of broader political disputes”.

The International Judo Federation (IJF) said Dris arrived for the weight control session on Sunday 10 minutes before the deadline and was found to be 400g over the allowed weight limit to compete on Monday. However, an Algerian newspaper hailed the judoka for “smartly avoiding meeting \[the\] Israeli opponent by failing to make the weight”.

One of the Algerian athletes’ sponsors, the telecom giant Mobilis, posted on Facebook: “Dris won everyone’s respect. My heart goes out to this athlete.”

Arad, a former judoka and the first Israeli to win an Olympics medal, told Reuters: “I think this is a disgrace. Algerian media and a sponsor of Algeria’s Olympic athletes hailed Dris.

“Following the [Olympic Games](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympic-games)
, a full review and investigation of the situation will be conducted and further action will be taken if needed,” the IJF said in a statement on Monday. Unfortunately, athletes often become victims of broader political disputes which are against the values of sport.”

The Paris Games are taking place amid pronounced security concerns and heightened geopolitical tensions, including over Israel’s war in Gaza following the 7 October attacks led by the Palestinian group Hamas.

The Algerian Olympic delegation declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. Dris was subsequently disqualified, with the bout awarded to Butbul, who then lost in the round of 16.

PARIS (AP) — The International Judo Federation will conduct an investigation after Messaoud Dris of Algeria missed weight at the [Paris Games](https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games)
 on the day before he was scheduled to face Tohar Butbul of Israel.

The bout was scheduled to be the first in the men’s 73-kilogram division Monday, but given its political implications, many suspected it would not happen from the moment Dris and Butbul were matched in the random draw last week.

“Following the Olympic Games, a full review and investigation of the situation will be conducted and further action will be taken if needed,” the IJF said in a statement on Monday.

It added that athletes failing to pass weight control is not unusual at judo competitions, noting that four judokas missed weight at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago.

“We believe that sport should remain a realm of integrity and fairness, free from the influences of international conflicts,” the judo federation said. Supreme Court](https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court)

Judo governing body to investigate Algerian who missed weight before Olympic bout against Israeli

“I think the Algerian athletes and all the Muslim athletes cannot go to the fight with Israeli athletes,” Butbul said. The IJF said Dris only showed up to the weigh-in 10 minutes before the deadline, which could indicate he had actually been trying and failing to cut weight.

The bout was Butbul’s third walkover victory in the past two Olympics, including two against Algerian opponents. Israel’s presence at the Paris Games has been protested at various points since the beginning of Israel’s offensive in Gaza last year, but the IOC and France’s government have firmly backed Israel’s right to participate.

Israel has one of the biggest judo teams at the Paris Games with 12 participants, and four Israeli judokas competed in the first two days of the tournament at Arena Champ-de-Mars.

Although none of their opponents avoided Israel’s first four judokas, Abderrahmane Boushita of Morocco and Nurali Emomali of Tajikistan both refused to shake the hand of Israel’s Baruch Shmailov following their bouts Sunday. “Unfortunately, athletes often become victims of broader political disputes which are against the values of sport.”

Butbul and Israel coach Guy Fogel said they believe Dris was pressured to miss the bout because of Algeria’s fraught relationship with Israel, which has led to several similar incidents in recent judo competitions.

The first phase of the war, he [writes](https://twitter.com/netanyahu/status/1710796924092129517)
 on X, involves “destroying most of the enemy forces” that have infiltrated into Israel and have killed civilians and soldiers.

Israel has also begun an offensive into Gaza “and it will continue without hesitation and without respite – until the goals are achieved.”

“We will restore security to the citizens of Israel and we will win,” he writes.

A senior Biden administration official says on a call with reporters that the US “will treat Hamas for what they are. They are an international terrorist organization.”

Washington’s focus is currently on “ensuring that the Israelis have what they need to respond appropriately,” says the official.

The White House official says the US is ready “to offer all appropriate means of support to the people and government of Israel.”

“Israel has a right to defend itself and its people. Full stop.”

“We remain deeply aligned,” said the official, adding that Israel’s response is likely to continue “for some time.

The official says that that US will continue to “work with parties throughout the region” to make sure the fighting doesn’t spread from Gaza.

The official also speaks about the potential of a normalization deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia, saying that it is “premature to say the impact” that the war will have on those efforts.

“That process has a ways to travel,” says the official, adding that “terrorist groups like Hamas will not derail any such outcome.”

In a statement to Hamas’s Al-Aqsa TV, the terror group’s military spokesman Abu Ubaida claims that the number of hostages taken into Gaza is “many times greater than what Netanyahu thinks,” and that they are being held in various locations throughout the coastal strip.

The spokesman also urges Israel not to make “miscalculations,” adding that “whatever happens to the people of the Gaza Strip, will happen to \[the hostages\].”

Israel is now facing a deep crisis after witnessing the heroism of Hamas militants, Abu Ubaida says, adding that Israeli soldiers fell before them “like locusts.”

Eleven Nepalese agricultural students have been injured, two of them seriously, in the Hamas attack on southern Israel, according to a statement by the Nepalese Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Nepal’s ambassador to Israel tells CNN that when the attack began, the students were working on a farm in the area. They hid in a bomb shelter but that building was taken over by Hamas.

Separate unconfirmed reports in the Hindustani Times and India Today state that some Nepalese students are also among those who have been taken hostage by Hamas.

The Israel Defenses Forces provides details on a number of airstrikes it carried out in the Gaza Strip in the last few hours.

The IDF says it carried out a drone strike on a rocket launcher, and killed two terrorists standing next to it.

In other drone strikes, a terror cell was hit while attempting to infiltrate into Israel via Zikim beach, and another cell was hit while trying to infiltrate from central Gaza, the IDF says.

Germany and France move to reinforce security around Jewish temples, schools and monuments after the surprise attack by Hamas against Israel.

Germany tightens police protection of Jewish and Israeli institutions, as some supporters of the Palestinians took to the streets of Berlin to celebrate the attack.

France is focusing on Jewish temples and schools in cities across the country, as one Jewish leader expresses concern at the possibility the conflict might be imported there.

“In Berlin, police protection has been immediately stepped up,” Germany’s Interior Minister Nancy Faeser tells Bild newspaper. “The federal government and the regions are closely coordinating their actions.”

Germany’s authorities are also closely watching “potential supporters of Hamas in the Islamist sphere,” she adds.

In France, security had already been stepped up at synagogues in Paris, Marseille, Lyon and Strasbourg because of the holiday period being observed since late September.

Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin sends an urgent message to prefects running the country’s regions asking them to reinforce surveillance even further.

“At a time when terrorist attacks from Gaza are hitting Israel, I ask you to immediately step up vigilance, security and protection of Jewish community sites in France,” he writes in a message seen by AFP.

He called for a “visible and systematic static presence,” and the use of soldiers from France’s Operation Sentinelle, a special force deployed across the country since the 2015 terror attacks. The interior ministry will review the security situation at a special meeting tomorrow.

By [Gianluca Pacchiani](https://www.timesofisrael.com/writers/gianluca-pacchiani/ "Gianluca Pacchiani")

Hussam Badran, a member of the political bureau of Hamas, says the terror group’s onslaught is only in its early stages.

Badran says the attack, called the “Al-Aqsa Deluge” by the terror group, comes after careful preparation aimed at catching Israel by surprise.

The terror leader says this battle is different from all previous rounds of conflict, and calls on Arab mediators to convey to Israel that it must “leave our occupied lands.”

He adds that Hamas does not expect them to be mediators but rather supporters of its position.

Like a number of Hamas leaders who have issued statements today, Badran claims the attack is motivated by Israeli control over the flashpoint Al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem.

The mosque, the third holiest site for Muslims, sits atop the Temple Mount, the holiest site for Jews as the location of the biblical temples. Israel has long maintained a delicate status quo at the site, in which Jews are allowed to visit during limited hours, but not pray. Terror groups have repeatedly used baseless claims of Israeli intentions to take over the mosque as a pretext for violence.

Badran also blames Israeli policies in the West Bank and its treatment of Palestinian prisoners for the attack, adding that “we are the owners of this land, and this occupation will not last forever.”

The surprise onslaught against Israel has killed at least 250 Israelis, including many civilians, and injured over 1,000. An unspecified number of Israelis, living and dead, are held hostage by terrorists in Gaza.

Irish deputy premier and foreign affairs minister Micheal Martin condemns the attack by Hamas on Israeli citizens, and says it is “vital that the voice of moderation comes to the fore.”

Martin says he could “see tensions rising” during a recent trip to the region, and that the scale of today’s attack is “quite shocking.”

“We believe a two-state solution remains the only sensible and rational solution to this issue and it needs political momentum behind it,” he says.

“My sense is that the hardliners are growing in influence, and that’s why I believe the need to have moderate voices in the center is key,” he says.

“So what we need really is a political peace process to get on track in a serious way. That will mean I think, international intervention as well to facilitate that, but it’s a very, very complex and difficult situation and there will be many consequences to today’s attack.”

The decision applies to Israel’s magistrates, district and labor courts, as well as the Supreme Court and the rabbinical courts.

The organization calls on the US government “to exert pressure on the occupation regime to immediately cease these atrocities” and criticizes any Arab and Muslim nations that have normalized relations with Israel.

According to the US State Department, Blinken calls “on all leadership in the region to condemn” the Hamas attacks on Israel, and also urges the PA to “enhance steps to restore calm and stability in the West Bank.”

Today in Ramallah, Abbas chaired an emergency leadership meeting of the Palestinian Authority, and according to the official news agency Wafa, “gave instructions to provide protection for the Palestinian people, stressing the right of the Palestinian people to defend themselves against the terrorism of settlers and the occupation forces.”

Abbas also “gave directions to provide all that is necessary to bolster the resilience and steadfastness of the Palestinian people in facing the crimes committed by the Israeli occupation and settler gangs.”

And he warns Hamas that Israel will hold it responsible for the hostages it has taken. “Israel will avenge anyone who is harmed,” he says, “in so much as a hair on their head.”

He says Israel stands in solidarity with residents of the south, who stood firm and fought bravely.

He praises the security forces, calling them the latest in the long history of Israel’s war heroes.

“You are fighting now for all of our homes, for all of our futures,” he says.

“We are all with you, we all love you, we all salute you.”

He praises the members of the emergency services, and says their spirit will help overcome our enemies.

He says he spoke with President Biden and other world leaders from France, Britain and beyond, thanks Biden for his “unreserved support,” and says he secured international backing for “freedom of action” for Israel.

Netanyahu says all Israelis “are in this together. It will take time. It will be hard. We have challenging days ahead of us.”

But he promises that “with God’s help, with our combined strength, and with our belief in an eternal Israel, we will win.”

In an address to the nation, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vows to use “all the power” of the IDF to destroy Hamas’s capabilities, and tells Gaza’s residents to “get out now.”

Calling today’s events something “never before seen in Israel,” he vows to ensure “it will never happen again.”

He begins by saying Hamas “invaded Israeli territory this morning,” and started a “cruel and evil war,” targeting innocent civilians young and old.

“We will win this war, but the price will be unbearably heavy,” he says.

“Hamas wants to murder us all,” Netanyahu says, “murdering children and mothers in their homes, in their beds.

“It is an enemy that kidnaps elderly people, children, young girls,” an enemy “that massacres and slaughters our civilians, our children, who simply wanted to enjoy the festival.”

“What happened today has never been seen before in Israel and I will ensure it never happens again. The entire government supports this decision. The IDF will immediately use all its power to destroy Hamas’s capabilities,” he says. “We will fight them to the bitter end and avenge this black day they plotted for Israel and its people.”

Israel will target Hamas everywhere — turning the places it “hides and operates” into “cities of ruin.”

He tells the “residents of Gaza” to “get out now because we will operate everywhere and with full force.”

The death toll from the Hamas terror group’s massive attack on Israel rises to more than 250, Hebrew-language media reports say, citing medical officials.

The toll is expected to continue to rise.

At least 1,450 have been wounded, many seriously.

Dozens of civilians as well as IDF soldiers are believed to have been abducted and brought into Gaza; the IDF has confirmed that soldiers and civilians have been taken hostage, but has not specified a number.

Thousands of rockets have been fired at the south and center of the country, killing a number of people.

US President Joe Biden backs Israel’s right to self defense, warns other parties in the region against joining the attack against the Jewish state, and says he is in contact with leaders around the region.

“Today the people of Israel are under attack orchestrated by a terrorist organization, Hamas. In this moment of tragedy, I want to say to them and to the world and to terrorists everywhere, the United States stands with Israel. We will not ever fail to have their back, we’ll make sure that they’ll have the help their citizens need and they can continue to defend themselves,” Biden says in a broadcast, while flanked by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken.

“The world has seen appalling images of thousands of rockets in a space of hours raining down on Israeli cities… Hamas terrorists crossing into Israel, killing not only Israeli soldiers but Israeli civilians in the streets, in their homes, innocent people murdered, wounded, entire families taken hostage by Hamas, just days after Israel marked the holiest of days on the Jewish calendar. It’s unconscionable.”

“Israel has the right to defend itself and its people, full stop. There’s never justification for terrorist attacks and my administration’s support for Israel’s security is rock solid and unwavering.”

“This is not a moment for any party hostile to Israel to exploit these attacks to seek advantage. The world is watching.”

“It’s also a terrible tragedy on a human level, hurting innocent people, seeing the lives that have been broken by this, the families torn apart. It’s heartbreaking.”

Biden says he has spoken to the king of Jordan and members of Congress, and told his national security team to engage with their Israeli counterparts for military, diplomatic and intelligence cooperation to “make sure Israel has what it needs.”

Biden has directed his team to be in constant contact with leaders around the region, including in Saudi Arabia, the Palestinian Authority, Turkey, Egypt, Qatar, Oman, the UAE and Europe.

He says he will remain in close contact with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whom he spoke to earlier today.

“Let there be no mistake, the United States stands with the State of Israel,” Biden says.

Magen David Adom names the senior paramedic and ambulance driver who was killed this morning as Aharon Haimov.

He died after being shot in an MDA ambulance by Palestinian terrorists as he was on his way to treat victims in his hometown of Ofakim as the coordinated attack on Israel by Hamas from Gaza unfolded.

Haimov was a 25-year-old married father of two. He also leaves behind parents, siblings and an extended family.

Haimov began his career with MDA as a post-high school volunteer. He later joined the organization in a professional capacity as an emergency medicine paramedic and ambulance driver.

In a statement, MDA says that Haimov always performed his duties in an exemplary way and was the first to respond to emergency events.

“He was a person who put the good of others and the value of life ahead of everything else — including today, on this tragic morning,” says MDA director-general Eli Bin.

By [Luke Tress](https://www.timesofisrael.com/writers/luke-tress/ "Luke Tress")

The UN Human Rights Council official tasked with investigating the Israeli-Palestinian conflict refrains from condemning Palestinian terrorists after they launch a devastating surprise attack on Israeli civilians and soldiers.

UN special rapporteur for the Palestinians Francesca Albanese says, “I unequivocally condemn attacks on civilians. Whoever launches them.”

“Today’s violence must be put into context. Almost six decades of hostile military rule over an entire civilian population… are in themselves an aggression,” Albanese says. Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005.

Albanese has a history of antisemitism and tends to place sole blame for the conflict on Israel, which she views as a “colonial” entity.

The US, Israel and other authorities have demanded her removal due to her bias, but the UN has not taken any action against her.

Martin Griffiths, UN under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, also hedges in his condemnation of terror.

“I am extremely alarmed by the rapidly escalating events in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory. The number of civilian casualties on both sides is reportedly already in the hundreds,” he says. “Violence is never the answer. I appeal to all sides to stop the fighting immediately and protect civilians everywhere and at all times.”

The UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker Türk, condemns the terror attacks.

“I am shocked and appalled at reports this morning that hundreds, possibly thousands, of indiscriminate rockets have been fired by Palestinian armed groups towards Israel, and that at least 22 Israelis have been killed and hundreds injured,” Türk says.

More recent figures indicate at least 200 Israelis have been killed, over 1,400 wounded, and others taken hostage.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and Tor Wennesland, the UN’s special coordinator for the Middle East peace process, both issue condemnations of the terror attacks.

Hersh Goldberg-Polin, 23, hasn’t been heard from since 8:11 a.m. this morning, when he sent two messages to his parents: “I love you” and “I’m sorry.”

At the time, Goldberg-Polin’s parents, Jon Polin and Rachel Goldberg, didn’t understand the cryptic meaning of the message.

They’d last seen Hersh at 11 p.m. the previous night, after he attended Simhat Torah holiday services with them at their local Jerusalem synagogue and then joined them for dinner with family friends.

“He had a backpack and left at around 11 to join his friend,” said Polin, who didn’t know anything specific about his son’s plans.

The family is religiously observant and doesn’t usually use phones on Shabbat, but after Polin came home early from synagogue Saturday morning, the two reached out to a good friend of their son’s who confirmed that Goldberg-Polin was at an all-night “nature party” near Kibbutz Re’im.

The community is close to the Gaza Strip, in an area where Hamas terrorists attacked civilians, including at the party.

Within several hours, photos of handwritten lists began circulating on social media with the names of party attendees and the locations where some had escaped to, Polin says.

“One list said Yishuv Saad, and his name was on that list, and then it was on the Ofakim list,” Polin says. “But he wasn’t at any of those places.”

Friends were at the couple’s home all day, calling and checking with people they knew in each location, but Goldberg-Polin and his friend haven’t been found anywhere. They called hospitals in the south, including Soroka and Barzilay, without any success.

The Jerusalem police are involved, Polin says, and are taking responsibility for reporting the two missing young men to all police units. Pictures of Polin-Goldberg and his friend are also being circulated on social media.

“They think there’s still a bunch of people hiding in the area,” Polin says, adding that the mother of his son’s friend is inclined to drive down south to look for them, but he advises against it, having heard that roads are closed. “Every time we hear information, we turn over everything we can to find out anything. There’s very little we can actually do.”

The Israel Defense Forces says it struck another two high-rise towers in the Gaza Strip, used by Hamas.

The “Palestine” building was used by a number of Hamas units, including intelligence, weapon production, and offices of senior members, the IDF says.

Another office building served as the headquarters of Hamas’s general security, the IDF says.

Earlier today, the IDF hit two other multistory buildings in the Gaza Strip that the military says housed Hamas assets.

Hamas commander Saleh al-Arouri (YouTube screenshot)

In an interview with Al Jazeera, Saleh al-Arouri, deputy head of the political bureau of Hamas, calls the terror group’s onslaught against Israel an “open battle” aimed at achieving the liberation of the Palestinian people and their holy places, following the perceived “desecration” of the Temple Mount in Jerusalem — known as the Al-Aqsa compound to Muslims — by Jewish worshipers over the holiday of Sukkot.

Al-Arouri alleges plans by Israel to impose an unspecified “new reality” at the flashpoint site after the holiday. Hamas has repeatedly accused Israel of seeking to alter the sensitive status quo at the holy site as a pretext for violence.

Al-Arouri adds that Palestinian detainees in Israeli jails are “about to be freed,” anticipating the liberation of security prisoners in exchange for dozens of Israeli hostages the group has reportedly taken, including both civilians and soldiers.

Al-Arouri says some of the Israeli hostages are “senior officers.” He falsely says Hamas does not kill or harm civilians, claiming that there are videos showing how the terror group treats civilians “humanely.” Hamas terrorists slaughtered civilians in southern Israel today, took others captive, and fired hundreds of rockets at civilian population centers.

“We have a plan for all stages of this conflict,” al-Arouri says, “both in case of an Israeli request for a ceasefire, and in case of a continuing escalation of the violence. We are prepared for all options.” He adds that an Israeli ground invasion would be the “best scenario” for Hamas.

Al-Arouri also expresses his “hope and trust” that Palestinians outside Gaza will join the fight “to defend Al-Aqsa,” especially terror groups in the West Bank. Al-Arouri is considered the de facto leader of Hamas in the West Bank.

“We entered this battle not just for a few hours. We entered it knowing that there will be consequences, and we have no choice but to fight it to achieve our high goals,” he says.

He adds that Hamas is in communication with international and regional parties, and implies that it has received offers for mediation. He also accuses the US of providing financial and military aid to Ukraine but neglecting Palestinians.

Al-Arouri touches on the possible participation of Hezbollah in the attack on Israel, saying Israel is right to fear violence on the Lebanese front in the north, claiming that Israel occupies part of Lebanon’s territory.

Yair Lapid (L), Benny Gantz (C) and Benjamin Netanyahu (R) (Flash90)

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu proposes that opposition parties Yesh Atid and National Unity enter an emergency government following Hamas’s devastating surprise attack Saturday morning.

Netanyahu makes the offer during a meeting with Yesh Atid leader Yair Lapid and National Unity party leader Benny Gantz held earlier today, saying such a government would be the same in format as the Levi Eshkol government then-opposition leader Menachem Begin joined before the Six Day War in 1967.

Gantz says he is considering entering such a government for the duration of the war but insists that government would “deal with security challenges alone” and in a manner that would allow “substantive partnership and influence over decision-making in relevant forums” for his party.

The National Unity party leader tells Netanyahu that regardless, the current government will receive full backing “for any responsible and determined security action.”

Lapid said earlier this evening that he would join “a reduced, professional, emergency government” and says it would be impossible to manage a war with “the extreme and dysfunctional composition of the current cabinet,” essentially calling on the prime minister to remove the far-right Religious Zionism and Otzma Yehudit parties from the government in order for him to bring his Yesh Atid party into the coalition.

The death toll from the Hamas terror group’s massive attack on Israel rises to more than 200, Hebrew-language media reports say.

The toll is expected to rise higher.

At least 1,100 have been wounded, many seriously.

Hundreds of Hamas gunmen infiltrated into Israel this morning, crossing at multiple points and overwhelming what the IDF considered to be the highly sophisticated border fence.

Hamas claims to have abducted dozens of Israelis to Gaza; the IDF has confirmed that soldiers and civilians have been taken hostage, but has not specified a number.

Thousands of rockets have been fired at the south and center of the country, killing a number of people.

The Hamas rocket barrage on central Israel a short while ago has wounded at least nine civilians, medics say.

The Magen David Adom ambulance service said in Rishon Lezion, medics treated two men aged 28 who were seriously hurt.

In Yavne, a 73-year-old woman was seriously hurt and a 77-year-old man was lightly hurt, MDA says.

In Bat Yam, a 24-year-old man was moderately hurt, MDA says.

In Tel Aviv, four people were wounded, including one in moderate condition, MDA adds.

The victims are being taken to hospitals in the area.

Hamas claimed to have launched 150 rockets from the Gaza Strip at Tel Aviv in the barrage.

A coalition of organizations behind the anti-judicial overhaul protests announce a general aid effort for residents of Israeli communities near the Gaza border, including hosting for citizens fleeing the fighting, transportation services, equipment logistics, assistance from mental health professionals, and more.

“At this difficult hour for our brothers and sisters in the south and the entire Jewish nation, the protest organizations are putting their complete organizational infrastructure and logistical capabilities toward the aid and support of the residents in the line of fire,” the organizations say in a social media notice.

The organizations also call for a freeze on all protest activities until further notice and said that while the “gigantic failure” of the security establishment in regards to the surprise Hamas attack must be addressed, “at this time all efforts must be directed toward aid of the southern residents, IDF soldiers and security forces.”

The White House slams a Republican “disinformation” campaign blaming the Biden administration for today’s Hamas attack on Israel.

Prominent Republican lawmakers as well as former president Donald Trump have claimed the US deal to release hostages from Iran gave Tehran access to funds that it is using to support Hamas.

“Not a single cent from these funds has been spent, and when it is spent, it can only be spent on things like food and medicine for the Iranian people,” says White House National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson.

“These funds have absolutely nothing to do with the horrific attacks today and this is not the time to spread disinformation,” she adds.

Turkey’s Foreign Ministry declines to condemn Hamas or say the word “terrorism,” saying only that they “are deeply concerned about the violence and tension occurred \[sic\] in Israel and Palestine today.”

“We attach high importance to the restoration of calm in the region as soon as possible, and strongly condemn the loss of civilian lives. We underline that acts of violence and associated escalations will not benefit anyone, and call on the parties to act with restraint and avoid impulsive steps.”

Ankara also urges “the parties” to work toward a two-state solution.

Magen David Adom thanks the Israeli public for its huge response to the call for blood donations for treating war victims at Israel’s hospitals. Thousands of units of blood were donated at the many MDA donation sites around the country.

As of 7:30 p.m. on Saturday, MDA says it has enough blood supply for the time being and has asked people to hold off on donating until tomorrow or later in the week.

At Ichilov Hospital in Tel Aviv alone, 650 individuals showed up to donate blood. Overwhelmed by the turnout, Ichilov announced that it had closed its blood donation station until further notice.

The Israel Defense Forces has regained control of the Re’im military base in southern Israel, which houses the Gaza Division, from Hamas terrorists, according to Hebrew-language media reports.

Earlier, the IDF said it was fighting Hamas terrorists at 22 different locations in southern Israel.

The military has been sweeping the towns where the terrorists infiltrated, reaching civilians who have been holed up for more than 12 hours.

Israel’s Ambassador to the UN Gilad Erdan sends a letter to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and Sérgio França Danese, the Brazilian diplomat who holds the Security Council presidency this month, calling on the Security Council to immediately condemn Hamas.

“It is now time for the international community including the Security Council to unequivocally condemn the appalling terror attacks carried out by Hamas and all terrorist organizations against the civilians of Israel,” Erdan writes.

“Israel expects and demands the solidarity and support of all those in the international community who oppose this barbaric terrorism and the targeting of innocent men, women and children for slaughter. It will not tolerate moral equivalence between those defending against this terrorism and those perpetrating it. There can be no option other than zero tolerance for Hamas’ war crimes and genocidal agenda.”

Erdan also places blame on Iran for, in his words, funding and directing Hamas.

“The State of Israel will act in any way necessary to protect its citizens and sovereignty from the ongoing terrorist attacks originating from the Gaza Strip and carried out by Hamas and other terrorist organizations,” he writes. “We will not stand idly by as Israelis are attacked and killed.”

The Israel Defense Forces claims to have killed hundreds of Palestinian terrorists in southern Israel and the Gaza Strip in the last few hours.

Among the counter-attacks is a drone strike against two terrorists attempting to breach the security barrier near the disused Karni crossing; nine terrorists killed during clashes with troops in the town of Nirim; and four terrorists targeted by a fighter jet at the Erez Crossing.

Other terror squads were killed by troops in the southern towns of Sufa, Kfar Aza, and Kerem Shalom, the IDF says.

The IDF also carried out several drone strikes against terrorists in the area.

The military publishes footage showing one of the strikes near the southern town of Be’eri.

Four terrorists are still holding two Israelis hostage in an apartment in Ofakim, some 12 miles (20 kilometers) from the Gaza border.

The incident has been playing out all day, since several carloads of terrorists drove into the city, Channel 12 reports.

When rocket alarms sounded, and residents of the city descended into bomb shelters, the gunmen opened fire on them, killing several people. Many terrorists have been killed in the hours since.

Four terrorists went up into an apartment in the city, where two Israelis remained, and they have been holding them hostage ever since.

Security forces have made several attempts to find a way to break in and rescue them, but to no avail thus far.

Magen David Adom’s Shai Kadosh says two people he knows were killed in the city during the day and that he and his colleagues have been treating casualties all day.

In light of the high number of injuries due to the war, the Health Ministry announces that all ambulatory and elective medical services will be canceled on Sunday at hospitals within 80 km of the Gaza border. Well-baby clinics will also be closed within that area.

Some hospitals in the center of the country, including Hadassah in Jerusalem and Meir in Kfar Saba, have also announced that they will only accept patients in need of urgent medical care.

Hospitals throughout the country will continue to provide critical and timely care, such as oncological and hematological treatments, dialysis, in vitro fertilization treatment, and emergency cardiological procedures.

If patients are scheduled for a hospital procedure or clinic visit on Monday, they should double-check with the hospital whether they should come in or not.

The Meuhedet health maintenance organization has asked its members to seek service from their primary physicians via hybrid (online) medicine appointments as much as possible.

All medical system employees have been ordered to cancel plans to travel outside the country, and all medical staff currently outside Israel have been asked to return.

The European Union “condemns in the strongest possible terms” the Hamas attacks on Israel, and stressed Israel’s right to self defense.

“The EU calls for an immediate cessation of these senseless attacks and violence,” says EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell in a statement issued on behalf of all 27 member states, “which will only further increase tensions on the ground and seriously undermine Palestinian people’s aspirations for peace.”

Borrell says the EU “stands in solidarity with Israel which has the right to defend itself in line with international law, in the face of such violent and indiscriminate attacks.”

A man says his wife, two young children and mother-in-law have been taken to Gaza and that he has seen them in a video from the coastal enclave.

Yoni Asher tells Channel 12 news that his wife and children aged three and five were visiting his mother-in-law at Kibbutz Nir Oz near the Gaza border when they were taken during an infiltration by Hamas terrorists.

Earlier this afternoon, he told the outlet that he had not spoken to his family for a number of hours but that he had tracked his wife’s phone to the Gaza Strip.

Asher issued desperate pleas for help in finding his family, speaking to multiple outlets in the hope that he could get the message out.

“I have seen my wife’s phone in \[Gaza city\] Khan Yunis,” he told the Kan public broadcaster. “I contacted the police, the Home Front Command and I don’t know what’s going on. I need your help so that I can contact my wife, my daughters and my mother-in-law.”

Israeli activists in the US launch a crowdfunding campaign to assist residents of southern Israel.

The activists from the anti-overhaul protest movement leverage their network of thousands of Israelis and US Jews in the US to respond to the Palestinian terror onslaught in Israel.

The funds will go to medical, psychological and physical support for the victims, [the campaign](https://www.americaisraeldemocracy.org/southunderattack)
 says.

“We join hands to support the needs of Israelis under attack. This is what we can do from here now,” organizers say. “This is exactly the same solidarity from which we stand in rallies every week.”

All protest activities are suspended.

With some flights to Israel canceled, the activists are also organizing local hosts who can house Israelis who are unable to return home.

Activists from the UnXeptable protest group urge Israelis who are in the US and need assistance to contact them.

An open support gathering will take place at the Jewish Community Center of Manhattan at 76th Street and Amsterdam Ave. between 2-4 p.m. this afternoon.

The Israeli consulate in New York also says it is accepting all offers of help and support.

“The Hamas terrorist organization deliberately places its military assets in the heart of the civilian population in the Gaza Strip,” the IDF says.

“Prior to the strike, the IDF provided advance warning to the occupants of the building and asked them to evacuate,” the military adds.

Opposition Leader Yair Lapid calls for an “emergency government” to manage “the difficult and complex operation ahead of us” after more than 100 Israelis have been killed, close to 1,000 wounded and an unknown number of soldiers and civilians abducted by Hamas terrorists into Gaza.

“The State of Israel is at war. It won’t be easy and it won’t be short. It has strategic consequences which we haven’t seen for many years. There is a serious risk that it will become a multi-front war,” Lapid says in an announcement.

“A short while ago, I met with Prime Minister Netanyahu. I told him that in this emergency situation I’m willing to put aside our differences and form an emergency, narrow, professional government with him to manage the difficult and complex operation ahead of us.”

Netanyahu, he says, “knows that with the current extreme and dysfunctional security cabinet, he can’t manage a war. Israel needs to be led by a professional, experienced, and responsible government. I have no doubt that former Defense Minister \[Benny\] Gantz would also join a government like this.”

“Forming an emergency professional government will make clear to our enemies that the vast majority of Israeli citizens stand behind the IDF and security forces. It will make clear to the world, in the international community, that the people of Israel stand united against this threat,” says Lapid.

“The State of Israel suffered a hard blow today. We are all hurting, we are all angry. However, wars and countries aren’t managed with pain and anger but with calm and a strategic understanding of the situation. We need to put politics to one side for the sake of an emergency government that will manage this situation with determination and won’t deal with anything else until we achieve victory over our enemies.”

Lapid made his offer for an emergency government in person to Netanyahu after receiving a security update, says a source close to the opposition leader.

The source says that “the offer is real, this isn’t a political thing. The offer is there.”

Netanyahu has not responded and a source close to Lapid declines to comment if fellow opposition party head, National Unity leader Gantz, was consulted before or after the unity government offer was made.

Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant speaks with US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, his office says.

During the call, which was requested by Secretary Austin, Gallant details recent events in Israel and operations carried out by the IDF and defense establishment, his office says.

Gallant says Israel is currently at war, and has been facing terror attacks against its citizens since this morning – this includes men, women, children and elderly individuals.

“The State of Israel will win this war, and Hamas will be held responsible for its actions,” his office says.

Gallant thanks Austin and the US Administration for their support for Israel.

US President Joe Biden says he told Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on their phone call earlier today, “we stand ready to offer all appropriate means of support to the government and people of Israel.”

“Terrorism is never justified. Israel has a right to defend itself and its people. The United States warns against any other party hostile to Israel seeking advantage in this situation. My administration’s support for Israel’s security is rock solid and unwavering,” Biden says in a statement condemning this morning’s surprise Hamas attack on southern and central Israel.

“Jill and I are keeping in our prayers all of the families who have been hurt by this violence. We are heartbroken by the lives that have been tragically cut short and hope for a swift recovery for all those who have been wounded,” he adds.

“My team and I are tracking this situation closely, and I will remain in close touch with Prime Minister Netanyahu,” Biden says.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has condemned Hamas’s surprise attack on southern and central Israel this morning.

“The secretary-general is appalled by reports that civilians have been attacked and abducted from their own homes,” says a statement from his spokesperson.

Guterres “is deeply concerned for the civilian population and urges maximum restraint. Civilians must be respected and protected in accordance with international humanitarian law at all times.”

“The secretary-general urges all diplomatic efforts to avoid a wider conflagration,” the statement continues. “He stresses that violence cannot provide a solution to the conflict, and that only through negotiation leading to a two-state solution can peace be achieved.”

Now that the IDF has confirmed that Israeli civilians and soldiers have been kidnapped and taken as hostages to Gaza, Israeli television is showing heavily pixelated clips that have been running for hours on social media.

The clips appear to show Israelis being abducted on foot and in vehicles, and were apparently filmed inside Israel and inside Gaza.

Many of the clips are too gruesome to broadcast.

By [Amanda Borschel-Dan](https://www.timesofisrael.com/writers/amanda-borschel-dan/ "Amanda Borschel-Dan")

Middle East analyst Avi Issacharoff tells The Times of Israel on Saturday that the unprecedented assault on Israel by land, sea and air is an inadvertent benchmark for the Israel-Hamas relations, as significant as the September 11, 2001 attacks on the US.

“I think that they wanted to kidnap a few people, to negotiate over them, and not to get into the threat of their collapse — of their ending” — that this coordinated attack will inevitably bring, Issacharoff says. “Everyone knows that Gaza will pay a very heavy price.”

Any former policies of cooperation with the Gaza-based terrorist organization are “not even relevant anymore,” he says, and negotiations “under or over the table” will no longer take place.

Asked whether he believes Israel’s northern border will become another front in the current war, he says it is as yet unclear whether Hezbollah is planning a coordinated attack.

“Either they’re going to jump in and be very stupid, or not,” he says.

“Starting another front with Israel may bring more \[Israeli\] casualties… but at the end of the day, we might end up with the end of Hamas and Hezbollah.”

“It’s the 9/11 \[for Israel\], and if this doesn’t go into a major ground operation, it’s the end of this government’s political life,” says Issacharoff.

The Israel Defense Forces’ top spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, confirms the Hamas terror group has taken Israelis as hostages to the Gaza Strip.

In a briefing with reporters, Hagari says Israeli soldiers have also been killed in the fighting.

No numbers are given on the number of hostages or soldiers killed.

Hagari says there are still 22 locations of ongoing fighting in southern Israel, including hostage situations in Be’eri and Ofakim.

He says Israeli troops have reached all towns on the Gaza border, and are working to scan each and every one.

Four divisions are being deployed to the Gaza border, joining 31 battalions that are already there, Hagari says.

Benny Gantz, the leader of the opposition National Unity party, pledges support for the security and emergency forces and says Israel is “completely unified.”

“I want to say clearly, in a way that resonates from Gaza, via Beirut, to Tehran: The entire people of Israel are united,” he says. “All Israel’s citizens stand behind the security forces, and the government has the backing to charge a heavy, painful and effective price in order that an event like this is not repeated.”

“There is no coalition and opposition now,” Gantz adds, “just a single fist that will pound the enemy.”

He says all those involved in this attack are destined to die, and that any other terror groups that decide to take part “will be making a terrible mistake.”

“It must be honestly said: the results of this attack are grave. Soon, some of the rumors will be confirmed as bad and painful news for us all. I send my condolences to the families of the fallen… and pray for the recovery of all the injured.”

He hails the bravery of civilians, the emergency services and soldiers. “Israel can be taken by surprise, but it cannot be beaten, as we will prove this time as well,” Gantz says.

Ra’am’s Mansour Abbas urges Arab Israelis not to respond to rumors or incitement

Abbas, leader of the Islamist Ra’am party, is the first Arab Israeli political leader to publish a statement reacting to the ongoing deadly Hamas assault on Israel.

The party leader writes in Hebrew: “In light of the sad, tragic events since this morning, and the situation assessments saying that the situation may devolve into a regional war, I call on Arab citizens of Israel and on all citizens, Arabs and Jews alike, to exert restraint and behave responsibly and patiently, to obey the law and maintain public order.”

“I urge \[Arab Israeli citizens\] to restrain from any type of violence or damage to public or private property, and not respond to rumors or incitement aimed at causing an escalation inside or outside Arab towns, or in mixed cities.”

Abbas further calls for unity and mutual support and to give hospitality to families fleeing the areas under attack, particularly in the Negev and in unrecognized villages, many of which are not equipped with anti-rocket shelters.

Ella, a resident of Kibbutz Be’eri, tells Channel 12 that she is in a safe room at her home in the kibbutz and is hearing “lots of gunfire” nearby.

She speaks amid unconfirmed reports that Hamas gunmen are holding hostages at the kibbutz dining hall.

Meanwhile, another resident of the south says his wife and daughters have disappeared, and that he has traced his wife’s phone — which doesn’t answer — to Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip. He says he fears his family has been kidnapped to Gaza.

Hamas claims to have kidnapped dozens of Israeli civilians and soldiers to Gaza.

These reports are not officially confirmed by Israel. Channel 12 news reports, however, that Hamas has kidnapped men and women, young and old, civilians and soldiers to the Gaza Strip. The infiltration is proving “far more successful” from Hamas’s perspective than it would have expected, the TV station’s Ohad Hemo says, and Hamas almost certainly doesn’t know itself how many Israelis it has kidnapped.

In turn, though, Hemo says, the Israeli response in Gaza is likely to be much more far-reaching than Hamas would have expected.

A senior adviser to Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei expresses support for an attack Hamas launched against Israel, calling it a “proud operation.”

“We support the proud operation of Al-Aqsa Flood,” Yahya Rahim Safavi says at a meeting held in support of Palestinian children in Tehran, quoted by ISNA news agency.

“We support this operation, and we are sure that the resistance front also supports this issue,” says Safavi, who is a senior general in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.

Safavi expressed backing for the Palestinian terrorists “until the liberation of Palestine and Jerusalem.”

Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman Nasser Kanani also hailed the Palestinian terror assault on Israel.

“Today’s operation marked a new page in the field of resistance and armed operations against the occupiers,” he says.

“The resistance has so far achieved brilliant victories during this operation, and this is a bright spot in the history of the Palestinian people’s struggle against the Zionists.”

At a parliament session on Saturday, Iranian lawmakers chanted “Down with Israel,” “Down with America,” and “Welcome Palestine,” according to a video published by Tasnim news agency.

Iran, which hosted leaders of Hamas and Islamic Jihad in June, considers Israel its arch-enemy.

German airline Lufthansa is cutting flights to Israel following a wave of Palestinian attacks, a spokesman tells AFP.

“Given the current security situation in Tel Aviv,” Lufthansa will maintain a single flight to Frankfurt but “all other Lufthansa flights to and from Tel Aviv have been canceled for this Saturday.”

The Walla news site says Swiss Air, Austrian Airlines and Turkish Airlines are among the companies to cancel flights to and from Israel.

Over nine hours since the Hamas terror group launched a deadly assault on Israel with terrorists infiltrating from land, air and sea, there are still gunmen in a number of Israeli communities.

In addition, there is still near-continuous rocket fire — while the center of the country was targeted by projectiles earlier in the day, the fire is now mainly toward southern towns.

By [Gianluca Pacchiani](https://www.timesofisrael.com/writers/gianluca-pacchiani/ "Gianluca Pacchiani")

Saudi Arabia calls for an “immediate halt to the escalation between the two sides, the protection of civilians, and restraint” amid the ongoing assault by the Hamas terror group.

Riyadh says it ‘repeatedly warned’ of an explosive situation with Palestinians.

In a statement, the Kingdom recalls its “repeated warnings of the danger of the explosion of the situation, as a result of the continued occupation, the deprivation of the Palestinian people of their legitimate rights, and the repetition of systematic provocations against its sanctities.”

The Saudi Foreign Ministry further calls on the international community to lead a “credible peace process” to achieve a two-state solution.

The kingdom has been conducting negotiations to achieve a normalization deal with Israel. According to recent leaks, the Saudi negotiators, while insisting on concessions for the Palestinians, do not see the creation of a Palestinian state as a precondition for a possible deal.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US President Joe Biden are expected to speak in the next hour amid a massive and deadly attack by the Hamas terror group on Israel.

Dozens have been killed and hundreds wounded as terrorists infiltrated from Gaza into Israeli towns, and thousands of rockets were launched at the south and center of the country.

President Isaac Herzog calls for the international community to unite in its condemnation of Hamas after the Gaza-based terror group launched a deadly attack.

“Today we saw the true face of Hamas. A terrorist army whose only goal is the cold-blooded murder of innocent men, women, and children. Supported and directed by their proxy commanders in Iran, they carried out an unprovoked, heinous attack against the Jewish state on a Jewish holy day. Innocent civilians were massacred and wounded, and many are still under attack,” Herzog says in a statement.

“The State of Israel will take all measures necessary to eliminate this clear and immediate danger to our citizens. Israel will overcome in the face of all challenges,” he says.

“I call upon the family of nations – this war waged against us marks a line in the sand. Now is the time to hear clear, unequivocal condemnation of Hamas, its allies, and its backers in Iran. Now is the time to stand firm with Israel in support of its just and moral battle in the face of an abhorrent enemy,” he says.

Palestinian media outlets report 160 killed and over 1,000 wounded recorded by hospitals in the Gaza Strip since this morning.

The toll likely includes those targeted by the Israeli military in airstrikes, and during clashes with troops in southern Israel.

Shoval Kahlon, a resident of Sderot, describes the situation in the border town which was infiltrated by Hamas terrorists.

“There are Hamas troops walking around. We see videos of them. They’re walking round with impunity,” she tells the Kan public broadcaster from the bomb shelter of her home.

Security forces are fighting terrorists in at least four areas in the town, the broadcaster reports.

“We woke up at 6:30 a.m. to alarms, we thought it was the usual rocket attacks but we started hearing gunshots on the street, sounded like it came from the parking of our building. Then we realized something was unusual. We then started seeing Hamas people in pickup trucks. They knocked on the homes of residents, who thought they were Israeli soldiers. They took them hostage,” says Kahlon.

The United States “unequivocally condemns the unprovoked attacks by Hamas terrorists against Israeli civilians,” says White House National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson.

“There is never any justification for terrorism. We stand firmly with the government and people of Israel and extend our condolences for the Israeli lives lost in these attacks,” Watson says.

US “National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan has spoken to Israeli National Security Advisor Tzachi Hanegbi and we remain in close contact with our Israeli partners,” Watson adds.

A baby has been found at Kibbutz Kfar Aza near the Gaza border, and the parents are nowhere to be seen, Channel 12’s Tamir Steinman reports.

The baby is alive. Kibbutz residents are pleading for anyone who has information on the baby’s family to come forward.

The kibbutz is one of several places where Hamas gunmen are still believed to be on the loose.

Steinman, speaking a few minutes later, also says several of his friends and contacts who live in areas close to the Gaza border, including some he was talking to earlier today, “are no longer answering… and it’s clear why they’re not answering.”

“These events have resulted in horrific scenes of violence and many Israeli fatalities and injuries, with many believed to be kidnapped inside the Strip. These are heinous attacks targeting civilians and must stop immediately,” Wennesland says in a statement.

“I am deeply concerned for the well-being of all civilians. I am in close contact with all concerned to urge maximum restraint and call on all sides to protect civilians.”

“This is a dangerous precipice and I appeal to all to pull back from the brink,” he adds.

The mayor of Sderot, Alon Davidi, says his city is still under attack.

“Don’t open the doors, stay inside, close the windows… we’re still searching the area,” he tells local residents via Channel 12.

He says the Hamas leadership, from Ismael Haniyeh on down, are “animals” who “must be harmed and killed.”

The people of Israel “haven’t yet seen” what’s happened in the city, he says — “inhuman acts” against innocent people. The terrorists have to be “wiped out,” he says.

Israel has given Gazans food, water and electricity, and allowed Gazans into work, he notes, but the Gaza Hamas leadership are “murderers who must be buried under the ground. Not because we are cruel, but because those who are merciful to the cruel, ultimately are cruel to the good.”

“People still don’t understand the numbers” and the extent of the attacks, he says.

A Channel 12 reporter in the city says there are many “bodies on the ground… terribly grave pictures, scenes that are hard to describe.”

These fatalities, the reporter stresses, are victims of gunfire by Hamas terrorists who infiltrated from Gaza into the city, not rocket attacks.

At least 40 people have been killed and over 700 injured since the start of the massive attack by the Hamas terror group, the Magen David Adom emergency service says.

The Health Ministry says 779 people have been hospitalized.

Terror cells from the Gaza group have infiltrated a number of communities in the south of the country.

In addition, thousands of rockets have been fired at the center and south.

Hamas has claimed to have taken a number of hostages from Israel to the Gaza Strip. There has been no confirmation from Israel.

The assault has been ongoing since approximately 6:30 a.m.

The death toll is expected to rise.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu makes a statement at the start of the security cabinet meeting, calling for all the citizens of the country to unite.

“Since this morning, the State of Israel has been at war. Our first goal is first of all to cleanse the area of the enemy forces that have infiltrated, and restore security and peace to the settlements that were attacked,” Netanyahu says.

“The second goal, at the same time, is to exact a huge price from the enemy, also in the Gaza Strip,” he says.

“The third goal is to fortify other arenas so that no one makes the mistake of joining this war,” Netanyahu says.

“We are at war, in war, you have to keep calm. I call on all citizens of Israel to unite in order to achieve our highest goal – victory in the war,” the premier says.

The official name for the campaign by the Israel Defense Forces amid the devastating Hamas attack is Operation Swords of Iron.

Ukraine’s President writes a long post condemning the devastating Hamas terror assault on Israel and says that all its details should be revealed to the world.

Here is the post in full:

“Horrible news from Israel. My condolences go out to everyone who lost relatives or close ones in the terrorist attack. We have faith that order will be restored and terrorists will be defeated.

“Terror should have no place in the world, because it is always a crime, not just against a specific country or this terror’s victims, but against humanity in general and our entire world.

“Anyone who resorts to terror commits a crime against the world. Whoever finances terror is committing a crime against the world. The world must stand united and in solidarity so that terror does not attempt to break or subjugate life anywhere and at any moment.

“Israel’s right to self-defense is unquestionable.

“All details surrounding this terrorist assault must be revealed so that the world knows and holds accountable everyone who supported and helped carry out the attack.

“All Ukrainian citizens who remain in the risk zone must carefully obey all orders issued by local security services and remain vigilant. Please be cautious. The Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and our embassy in Israel are ready to assist in any situation.

“To support Ukrainians in Israel, we established an operational headquarters. If you require assistance, please contact any of our diplomatic or consular offices in any convenient and accessible manner.

Every life is valuable! We condemn all forms of terrorism.”

Channel 12 broadcasts footage from earlier this morning apparently showing a bulldozer breaking through the border fence between Israel and the Gaza Strip.

Dozens of terrorists from the Hamas terrorist group infiltrated into Israel by land, air and sea, going on deadly rampages through border communities.

The Hamas terror group has published footage showing its members capturing a number of Israeli soldiers during an attack on a military base on the border with the Gaza Strip this morning.

Other clips circulated online have purported to show Israeli civilians taken hostage by the terror group.

The IDF has yet to comment on the allegations.

“This is against international law,” he writes. “Hostages must be released immediately.”

European leaders roundly condemn the massive assault by the Hamas terror group on Israel.

German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock says Hamas contributes to “the intensification of violence,” adding Israel “has our full solidarity” and “the right, guaranteed by international law, to defend itself against terrorism.”

France expresses “full solidarity with Israel and the victims” and underscored “its absolute rejection of terrorism and its commitment to Israel’s security.” French President Emmanuel Macron said he “firmly condemns” the attacks.

Italy also backed “Israel’s right to defend itself” against the “brutal attack.”

Britain’s foreign minister James Cleverly condemns the “horrific attacks” and underlined Israel’s right to self-defense.

Dutch PM Mark Rutte says: “Appalling images from Israel. Terror organization Hamas is waging an unprecedented attack on Israel… This violence must stop; Israel has every right to defend itself.”

Spain says it is “shocked by the indiscriminate violence” of the attacks on Israel while Ukraine and the Czech Republic say they back Israel’s right to defend itself.

The European Union “unequivocally” condemns attacks by the Palestinian group Hamas on Israel and called for an immediate stop to the violence.

The comments came after a barrage of rockets was fired and fighters from the Palestinian enclave infiltrated Israel, a major escalation in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

EU chief Ursula von der Leyen says she “unequivocally” condemns the “terrorist attack by Hamas on Israel,” adding that it was “terrorism in its most contemptible form.”

“Israel has the right to defend itself against such odious attack,” she adds.

“This horrific violence must stop immediately. Terrorism and violence solve nothing. The EU expresses its solidarity with Israel in these difficult moments,” EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell says.

European Council president Charles Michel also condemns the “indiscriminate attacks launched against Israel and its people this morning inflicting terror and violence against innocent citizens.”

“My thoughts are with all the victims. EU stands in solidarity with Israeli people in this horrific moment.”

Hezbollah adds that the “Al-Aqsa Deluge” operation launched by Hamas against Israel is a message to the international community and the Arab and Muslim world, in particular those countries seeking normalization with Israel.

It also calls on the Israeli government to learn the “important lessons” taught by the “Palestinian resistance.”

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gives a statement on October 7, 2023 (Screen grab)

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gives his first public statement on the massive attack by the Hamas terror group, saying the country is at war.

“Citizens of Israel, we are at war,” he says. “And we will win.”

“The enemy will pay a price like they have never known before,” he says, in his first public statement on the matter, some five hours since the start of the assault by the Gaza-based terror group.

There are reports of a number of dead and nearly 300 wounded as terrorists infiltrate a number of southern towns and thousands of rockets are fired at the center and south of the country.

Israeli residents near the Gaza Strip continue to ask for help and report on shooting by terrorists inside the towns while there is little or no IDF presence on the streets.

A pregnant Kibbutz Sufa resident speaks to Channel 12 from a safe room with her two-year-old child and close family members, saying: “They are shooting at our house, they are trying to break down the door of the safe room.”

She reports that her husband and four other armed residents are fighting in the streets with no aid from the military.

“I don’t understand how this is still going on. We’re in this situation since 6 a.m.,” she says. “Four people cannot fight them off alone

“Send help, please,” she cries.

Residents in other areas near the Gaza Strip report of unprecedented fighting on all major Israeli media sources. In an Instagram story timed to 9:55 a.m. cited by Ynet, a resident of Kfar Gaza writes: “I’m begging you!!! We can’t catch anyone! There are terrorists in Kfar Gaza, send forces to Kibbutz Kfar Gaza!!!”

A Channel 12 reporter in Beersheba describes receiving dozens of requests for help from residents of the Gaza Strip.

Mirjam Reijnen, a 42-year-old volunteer firefighter in Nahal Oz, tells AP: “With rockets we somehow feel safer, knowing that we have the Iron Dome (missile defense system) and our safe rooms. But knowing that terrorists are walking around communities is a different kind of fear,” she said, adding that she and her three kids have been too scared to leave the shelter even for a moment to use the bathroom.

Videos posted on social media showed what appeared to be uniformed Palestinian gunmen inside the Israeli border town of Sderot.

A video from Gaza showed what looked like the lifeless body of an Israeli soldier being trampled by an angry crowd shouting “God is Great.”

Another video appeared to show Palestinian militants dragging away a live Israeli soldier on a motorcycle.

Other videos showed a crowd of Palestinian men dancing around and atop an Israeli tank that was on fire.

The authenticity of the videos could not immediately be verified.

Hamas says it has launched 5,000 rockets at Israel in an early morning surprise attack it calls “Operation Al-Aqsa Flood.”

Mohammad Deif, the Hamas military commander, issues a statement saying that the ongoing attacks are in retaliation for Israel’s “desecration” of the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem.

He adds that Israel killed and wounded hundreds of Palestinians this year, and that Israel rejected offers for prisoner exchange deals.

Over 5,000 missiles were fired, Deif claims.

“Today, the people are bringing back the revolution and reviving the March of Return,” he says.

He urges Arabs in Jerusalem and inside Israel, in the Negev, the Galilee and northern Israel “set the earth on fire under the feet of the occupiers.”

He further calls on the “Islamic resistance in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Lebanon” — countries with terror movements that are militarily supported by Iran — to “merge their resistance with that of the Palestinians today,” and “start marching towards Palestine now.”

Saleh al-Arouri, deputy head of Hamas who is considered to be its leader in the West Bank, issued a statement along the same lines, calling on the Arab and Islamic nations to join “Operation Al-Aqsa Flood.”

The video has been shared by Ryan Rozbiani @RyanRozbiani with the caption: “Hezbollah has claimed responsibility for the missile attack, stating the target was the headquarters of Israel’s Unit 8200 in Tel Aviv. Activating air defenses in Tel Aviv to try to confront a heavy missile barrage from Hezbollah. Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv has halted all air traffic due to the missile launches.”

In a statement, the Iran-backed group said it had fired missiles at the Nirit area in the Israeli capital. In a Telegram post, the Lebanese group said they carried out the recent attack in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza and in support of protecting the Lebanese people. Hezbollah’s statement came after a video verified by Al Jazeera’s Sanad agency.

According to a Reuters report, sirens sounded all around Tel Aviv during the airstrike. No casualties have been reported in the attack so far. Citing Israeli media reports, Al Jazeera reported that all air traffic at Ben Gurion airport was suspended after Hezbollah carried out airstrikes and the Israeli military declared a state of emergency in the Tel Aviv region.

The Israeli military confirmed that Hezbollah fired at least 20 rockets toward Tel Aviv.

Hezbollah and Israel have been engaged in a fierce military conflict since the Palestinian militant group Hamas launched a massive attack on Israel on October 7, 2023.

TEL AVIV, July 19 (Reuters) - A long-range Iranian-made drone hit the centre of Tel Aviv in the early hours of Friday in an attack claimed by the Yemen-based [Houthi](/world/middle-east/who-are-yemens-houthis-why-are-they-under-attack-2024-01-12/)
 militia that killed one man and wounded four others, the Israeli military and emergency services said.

The explosion, which footage shared on social media suggested came from the sea and did not trigger air raid alarms, occurred hours after the Israeli military [confirmed](/world/middle-east/commander-hezbollahs-radwan-forces-killed-israeli-strike-south-lebanon-two-2024-07-18/)
 it had killed a senior commander of the Iran-backed Hezbollah militia in southern Lebanon.

Chief spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said the military assessed that the drone, which hit a building near the beachfront close to U.S. Embassy premises in Tel Aviv, was an upgraded Iranian-made Samad-3 model.

"Our estimation is that it arrived from Yemen to Tel Aviv," he told a press briefing.

A spokesman for the Houthis, which like Hezbollah are aligned with Iran, said the group had attacked Tel Aviv with a drone and would continue to target Israel in solidarity with Palestinians in the Gaza war.

The attack, which took place ahead of a visit to Washington by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu next week, is likely to fan fears about further fallout from the Gaza war as the Houthis and other Iranian proxies side with the Palestinian militant group Hamas.

Defence Minister Yoav Gallant met military commanders to review air defences and said the country had to be ready for all scenarios. "We must be prepared for defensive and offensive actions," he said, according to a statement from his office.

An Israeli official said the military was still investigating why the drone did not trigger the alarm, but initial reports suggested the aircraft was identified but the sirens were not sounded due to human error.

"We're talking about a large UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) that can fly large distances," the military official told journalists after the strike.

**\[1/12\]**A man looks at a building damaged at the site of an explosion, amid the Israel-Hamas conflict in Tel Aviv, Israel July 19, 2024. The mayor of Tel Aviv said the city, Israel's economic centre, had been moved to a state of heightened alert.

In the hours following Friday's attack, sirens sounded repeatedly in areas close to the border with Lebanon and Israeli air defences intercepted at least one aerial target that crossed into Israel.

"OPERATION ACHIEVED ITS GOALS"
------------------------------

Houthi spokesperson Yahya Saree called Tel Aviv a primary target "within the range of our weapons".

He said the strike was carried out using a new drone called "Yafa", which he said was capable of bypassing interception systems and undetectable by radars.

"The operation has achieved its goals successfully," Saree said in a televised speech.

Israel's emergency services said the body of a 50 year-old man was found in an apartment close to the explosion and four people were taken to hospital with slight shrapnel injuries.

The military said air patrols had been increased to protect Israeli airspace but said it had not ordered new civil defence measures. All of them were later released, health services said.

Israel has been exchanging daily missile and artillery fire with Hezbollah along its northern border and in southern Lebanon since the start of the war in Gaza, prompting fears of a wider regional conflict if the situation escalates.

The Houthis have also stepped up attacks against Israel and Western targets, saying they are acting in solidarity with the Palestinians, after Israel invaded the Gaza Strip following last year's attack by Hamas militants on southern Israel.

Hamas-led fighters stormed Israeli towns on Oct. Since then, nearly 39,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's assault on the Gaza Strip, according to health authorities in the enclave.

[SKIP ADVERTISEMENT](#after-bottom) It was at least the sixth such attack over the past month.

The attack set off air-raid sirens across central Israel ordering hundreds of thousands of residents to enter reinforced bomb shelters. The missile landed in a playground in Tel Aviv in the middle of the night.

Yahya Saree, a military spokesman for the Houthis, said the group’s fighters had launched the missile “to aid the victory of the oppressed Palestinian people and its fighters.” He also claimed it had struck a “military target.”

On Thursday, Israeli fighter jets flew over 1,000 miles to bombard sites in Houthi-controlled Yemen, including the capital, Sana. The Israeli military said it had struck power plants as well as fuel and oil tanks.

Israel and the Houthis, who control much of northwestern Yemen, have traded fire since October 2023, when the Yemeni militia began firing rockets and drones at Israel in what it has described as a campaign in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.

The sources are from Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Houthi_drone_attack_on_Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Houthi_drone_attack_on_Israel)), Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-military-says-tel-aviv-blast-apparently-caused-by-drone-2024-07-19/](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-military-says-tel-aviv-blast-apparently-caused-by-drone-2024-07-19/)), and The New York Times ([https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/20/world/middleeast/israel-tel-aviv-missile-yemen.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/20/world/middleeast/israel-tel-aviv-missile-yemen.html)).


## Elaboration
The claim that the image shows the aftermath of a Houthi attack on Tel Aviv in July 2024 is supported by the evidence. The reverse image search reveals that the image was used in an article about an explosion in Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024. Furthermore, web searches confirm that a Houthi drone attack occurred on the same date, targeting an apartment building in Tel Aviv.

*   Over 40 airlines have canceled flights in and out of Israel amid the ongoing war.
*   At least 900 people have died in Israel following surprise attacks by Hamas militants.
*   Travelers in Israel say they've faced long lines and multiple canceled flights trying to get home.

 during which at least 687 Palestinians have been killed and 3,800 more have been injured, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.

The ongoing war has thrown Israel's travel industry into chaos
--------------------------------------------------------------

More than [40 airlines have canceled flights to and from the country](https://www.businessinsider.com/airlines-canceling-flights-to-israel-tel-aviv-2023-10)
.

"People are just scared and trying to get out," Lia Hershkovitz, who flew out of Ben Gurion airport on Sunday, told Insider.

Muki Portnoy, her husband, and three children were supposed to fly home to New Jersey on a United flight that was canceled. Their travel agent booked them another flight on Monday to Madrid via the Spanish carrier Iberia. On the shuttle ride to the airport after dropping off their rental car, Portnoy got a notification that their flight had been canceled, she said.

"When we arrived, the airport was just completely mobbed. Lines were out the door, almost," she said.

Portnoy and her husband looked for alternative flights. She said they were repeatedly waved away by airport workers, and that Israel's El Al airline wasn't letting anyone stand in line at the ticket counter unless they already had a reservation. (Insider has contacted the airline for comment.) She said their travel agent waitlisted their party of five on 40 different El Al flights, but none of them had available seats. 

She described the scene as "hundreds and hundreds of frustrated people. People crying. Lots and lots and lots of families just sitting on the floor, waiting around. Lots of long lines everywhere. People confused, not really sure where to go and what to do."

Portnoy's husband returned to the airport the following day, waiting in line for five hours until he secured tickets for a flight on Wednesday.

It took Hannah Zucherman three tries to book a flight out of Israel in her efforts to get home to San Francisco. She said the airline of the second flight she booked, on Turkish Airlines, didn't even notify her that it had been canceled. Instead, she says she found out by looking it up on Ben Gurion's website. Insider has contacted Turkish Airlines for comment.

When she did successfully buy a ticket and make it through security, she found the waiting areas eerily silent.

"Inside the terminal it was very quiet and folks were clearly on edge," Zucherman said. "Normally, there are kids running around and lots of noise. This time it was much more subdued."

Israelis trying to return home are also facing challenges
---------------------------------------------------------

Jerusalem resident Daniel Rosehill's El Al flight from Barcelona to Israel on Monday was delayed for a few hours, but he eventually made it to Israel.

"The cabin crew made a sort of somber announcement about these being difficult times and El Al being committed to bringing Israelis home," he told Insider. 

Rosehill said the arrivals terminal was "noticeably more quiet than usual, but otherwise business as normal." When he stepped off the plane, he noted signs indicating the nearest shelter from incoming rocket fire.

The Israel Airports Authority has not responded to Insider's request for comment.

TEL AVIV, July 19 (Reuters) - A long-range Iranian-made drone hit the centre of Tel Aviv in the early hours of Friday in an attack claimed by the Yemen-based [Houthi](/world/middle-east/who-are-yemens-houthis-why-are-they-under-attack-2024-01-12/)
 militia that killed one man and wounded four others, the Israeli military and emergency services said.

The explosion, which footage shared on social media suggested came from the sea and did not trigger air raid alarms, occurred hours after the Israeli military [confirmed](/world/middle-east/commander-hezbollahs-radwan-forces-killed-israeli-strike-south-lebanon-two-2024-07-18/)
 it had killed a senior commander of the Iran-backed Hezbollah militia in southern Lebanon.

Chief spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said the military assessed that the drone, which hit a building near the beachfront close to U.S. "We must be prepared for defensive and offensive actions," he said, according to a statement from his office.

An Israeli official said the military was still investigating why the drone did not trigger the alarm, but initial reports suggested the aircraft was identified but the sirens were not sounded due to human error.

"We're talking about a large UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) that can fly large distances," the military official told journalists after the strike.

**\[1/12\]**A man looks at a building damaged at the site of an explosion, amid the Israel-Hamas conflict in Tel Aviv, Israel July 19, 2024. Embassy premises in Tel Aviv, was an upgraded Iranian-made Samad-3 model.

"Our estimation is that it arrived from Yemen to Tel Aviv," he told a press briefing.

A spokesman for the Houthis, which like Hezbollah are aligned with Iran, said the group had attacked Tel Aviv with a drone and would continue to target Israel in solidarity with Palestinians in the Gaza war.

The attack, which took place ahead of a visit to Washington by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu next week, is likely to fan fears about further fallout from the Gaza war as the Houthis and other Iranian proxies side with the Palestinian militant group Hamas.

Defence Minister Yoav Gallant met military commanders to review air defences and said the country had to be ready for all scenarios. All of them were later released, health services said.

Israel has been exchanging daily missile and artillery fire with Hezbollah along its northern border and in southern Lebanon since the start of the war in Gaza, prompting fears of a wider regional conflict if the situation escalates.

The Houthis have also stepped up attacks against Israel and Western targets, saying they are acting in solidarity with the Palestinians, after Israel invaded the Gaza Strip following last year's attack by Hamas militants on southern Israel.

Hamas-led fighters stormed Israeli towns on Oct. The mayor of Tel Aviv said the city, Israel's economic centre, had been moved to a state of heightened alert.

In the hours following Friday's attack, sirens sounded repeatedly in areas close to the border with Lebanon and Israeli air defences intercepted at least one aerial target that crossed into Israel.

"OPERATION ACHIEVED ITS GOALS"
------------------------------

Houthi spokesperson Yahya Saree called Tel Aviv a primary target "within the range of our weapons".

He said the strike was carried out using a new drone called "Yafa", which he said was capable of bypassing interception systems and undetectable by radars.

"The operation has achieved its goals successfully," Saree said in a televised speech.

Israel's emergency services said the body of a 50 year-old man was found in an apartment close to the explosion and four people were taken to hospital with slight shrapnel injuries. Since then, nearly 39,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's assault on the Gaza Strip, according to health authorities in the enclave.

    ! His remarks followed a meeting with top military and intelligence officials to assess the strike.

The military identified the drone as an Iranian Samad-3, upgraded to travel long distances, and said it was believed to have come from Yemen.

The [Houthis](https://www.theguardian.com/world/houthi)
 claimed responsibility, saying their “UAV \[unmanned aerial vehicle\] force” attacked “one of the important targets in the occupied Jaffa region, what is now called Israeli Tel Aviv”.

Earlier this month, Israeli forces said they had detected a suspected Houthi drone headed for the Red Sea port of Eilat, which they shot down with a fighter jet.

The Iran-backed group has launched waves of attacks targeting shipping through the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, causing significant disruption and a sharp drop in business at the port of Eilat.

The Houthis have said they launched the attacks in response to Israeli attacks on Gaza, which have so far killed more than 38,000 people since the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel.

The drone attack shook residents of Tel Aviv, undermining a fragile sense of security as Israelis living close to the border with Lebanon increasingly fear incursions by drones or rockets sent by Hezbollah, while communities close to the border with Gaza remain on high alert for sporadic rocket fire.

Footage from the site in Tel Aviv showed broken glass strewn across the pavements as crowds of onlookers gathered near a building bearing blast marks. <image:2528>

[SKIP ADVERTISEMENT](#after-bottom) building, an attack that analysts assessed had possibly been an attempt by the Houthis to strike anywhere they could in Tel Aviv. The Houthis, an Iranian-backed militia that has been attacking ships in the Red Sea, claimed responsibility for the strike on the city of 450,000 people.

The Israeli military’s chief spokesman, Rear Adm. No air-raid sirens warned residents before the drone crashed into the building, causing an explosion that jolted people from their sleep, shattered windows and left shrapnel scattered on the streets.

“We are investigating why we did not identify it, attack it and intercept it,” Admiral Hagari said on Friday.

Another Israeli military official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity, said there was a possibility that human error had allowed the drone to penetrate Israeli airspace.

Israeli officials did not announce an immediate military response against the Houthis, who control much of northwestern Yemen. The group has attempted several attacks on southern Israel, but this one managed to reach farther into the country."

# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim states that the image shows Israelis fleeing the airport after the Houthi attack on July 19, 2024. While the evidence confirms the attack, there is no information to verify that the image depicts the aftermath of the attack. The image search reveals that the image shows a crowded airport in Israel, but it does not provide any context about the attack. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence. `not enough information`

Rob D'Amico, a former FBI supervisory special agent, appears on CNN on Friday, July 19.

CNN

A former FBI supervisory special agent said the national security implications of today’s global computer outage are “bigger than most people think.”

Rob D’Amico said that nation-state cyber actors — otherwise known as adversaries with maliciously targeted cyber activity, according to the [Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/cyber-threats-and-advisories/nation-state-cyber-actors)
 — are likely keeping track of what happened during the tech disruption.

He added that another national security issue could be cyber actors potentially taking advantage of the outage by attempting phishing cyberattacks.

CrowdStrike, the company behind the tech disruption, said [in a statement](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/statement-on-falcon-content-update-for-windows-hosts/)
 Friday that “this was not a cyberattack” and that the company’s team “is fully mobilized to ensure the security and stability of CrowdStrike customers.”

D’Amico said he is skeptical of the firm saying the debacle was not a security incident.

When computers and tech systems around the globe [went down Friday](https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/global-outage-intl-hnk/index.html)
, many people had one question: How could this happen in 2024?

A software update from a single cybersecurity company, US-based CrowdStrike, was the root cause of the chaos, underlining the [fragility of the global economy](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/19/business/recovery-global-crowdstrike-outage/index.html)
 and its dependence on computer systems to which relatively few people give a passing thought.

**CrowdStrike is everywhere:** Numerous Fortune 500 companies use [CrowdStrike’s cybersecurity software](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/19/tech/crowdstrike-update-global-outage-explainer/index.html)
 to detect and block hacking threats. July 19, 2024, global tech outage news

The CEO of CrowdStrike promised customers “full transparency” on how the global IT outage involving the company’s software occurred.

George Kurtz said on Friday that CrowdStrike would take steps “to prevent anything like this from happening again,” according to a statement on the company’s website.

“We have mobilized all of CrowdStrike to help you and your teams” to recover from the outage, the embattled CEO told customers.

**But that could be easier said than done:** Manual restarts of individual systems take time and expertise that some customers don’t have, which is why companies are slow to recover from the outage.

“All of CrowdStrike understands the gravity and impact of the situation,” Kurtz added.

“We are working on a technical update and root cause analysis that we will share with everyone as well,” Kurtz said in a separate post on X Friday afternoon.

A global malfunction Friday on Microsoft’s Windows operating system, apparently linked to the IT security firm CrowdStrike’s Falcon platform, caused outages at banks, airlines, news outlets, health systems and other organizations around the world.

“This is a worldwide issue on systems connected to a cybersecurity software, and not a local Israeli event,” Yoram HaCohen, who heads the Israel Internet Association told the Ynet news site.

HaCohen said that the problem appeared to be connected to a recent CrowdStrike software update, but cautioned it was too early to say “with certainty” that it was the product of a good-faith error rather than a malicious event.

In Israel, the Health Ministry said the outage impacted more than a dozen hospitals in Israel, including Shaare Zedek in Jerusalem, Laniado in Netanya, Barzilai in Ashkelon, Wolfson in Holon and a number of others, as well as the healthcare provider Meuhedet.

The affected hospitals were operating on a manual basis, as their digital services are inaccessible, the ministry said, stressing that patient care is not affected, and the hospitals are prepared for such an outage following drills.

Ambulances were nevertheless told to take patients to unaffected hospitals, the ministry noted.

The ministry also warned that Israelis could have trouble calling the country’s medical emergency line, and advised that people call the police instead if they couldn’t get through — but noted that there had been no problems on the line so far.

Pharmacies also reported problems receiving some prescriptions from state healthcare providers, the Haaretz newspaper reported.

Meanwhile, the outage disrupted air travel around the world.

Ben Gurion Airport did not appear to be directly affected but was expected to see some impact from flights being canceled, delayed, or diverted as a result of problems elsewhere.

[! In contrast, US airlines Delta, United, Allegiant, and American all grounded their flights, and three Indian airlines also reported extensive IT disruptions.

Meanwhile, Berlin’s airport halted all flights, while the Spanish airport operator said that all airports in that country were affected, and problems were reported at other European airports as well.

Israel Electric Corporation’s call center was also down amid the outage, and the Port of Ashdod said in a statement that all service for trucks and ships was suspended as technicians examined the issue.

 in Turkey and Syria.

Hunched amidst the rubble in Kahramanmaras, Mesut Hancer is pictured holding the hand of his daughter 15-year-old Irmak – her pale fingers visible through the slabs of concrete and broken bricks that once formed the apartment block where the family lived.

Irmak is still lying on her bed, with what appears to be a pink bedsheet pulled from it to expose the mattress. Around her lies debris – from a sofa cushion to the heavy brick walls, smashed into tiny pieces.

Her father gazes into the distance with a vacant expression, as he sits sat on the rubble of what was once their home.

The earthquake occurred around 4km southeast of Ekinözü in the Kahramanmaraş province, where Mr Hancer and his daughter are pictured. Some of the heaviest devastation occurred between Kahramanmaras and Gaziantep, a city of two million people where entire streets now lie in ruins as snow falls.

Turkish authorities report that 13.5 million people were affected across an area spanning roughly 450km from Adana in the west to Diyarbakir in the east, and 300km from Malatya in the north to Hatay in the south.

Another heartbreaking story of loss, the newborn was the only member of her family to survive. She is believed to have been born three hours earlier, according to how far her temperature had plummeted.

Footage of the rescue shows a search team member lifting the dust-covered infant to safety in the small town of Jinderis. Located in the rebel-held enclave of northwest Syria close to the Turkish border, it was hard hit by the quake with multiple buildings destroyed.

The story behind this Turkey earthquake photo that 'many will never forget'
===========================================================================

Turkish father Mesut Hancer wanted the world to see his — and his nation's — grief. And it did.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![A man sitting holding the hand of someone who is beneath rubble.](https://images.sbs.com.au/dims4/default/f96276f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3039x1710+463+624/resize/1280x720!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsbs-au-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F6e%2Ff1%2Ff608b67744b0b21f069d8e6188b7%2Fgettyimages-1246861398.jpg&imwidth=1280)

###### KEY POINTS

*   Mesut Hancer was photographed as he held the hand of his daughter who was buried beneath debris.
*   It was a delicate moment. But instead of shooing a photographer away, the father called him in.
*   The photo appeared on the front pages of major newspapers across the world

It was a moment encapsulating the unspeakable pain of the Turkish earthquake: a father holding his 15-year-old's hand, the only thing visible after her body was crushed by concrete.  
  

Mesut Hancer sat alone in the freezing cold on a pile of broken bricks that were once his home, oblivious to the world and overwhelmed by grief.  
  

His daughter, Irmak, was dead. But he refused to let her go, caressing the fingers peeking out from a mattress the girl was asleep on when [the first pre-dawn tremor struck on Monday](/news/article/australia-pledges-10-million-in-aid-to-syria-and-turkey-as-devastating-earthquake-kills-thousands/s7c0xn5y5)
.  
  

There were no rescue teams. Survivors were frantically clawing their way through the rubble to find loved ones, bits of their homes thrown out onto the debris-strewn street.

Bedframes lay on top of shattered balconies. Torn clothes and toys told the tale of lives lost.  
  

It was too late for Irmak, one of nearly 20,000 people confirmed to have died in [the most powerful earthquake to strike Turkey and Syria in nearly a century](/news/article/the-three-reasons-why-the-turkey-syria-earthquake-was-so-devastating/qgetwuxvv)
.  
  

But Adem Altan, a veteran photographer with news agency AFP who rushed to the scene from Ankara, could not take his eyes off the still, silently mourning father.  
  

He trained his camera on Mr Hancer from 60 metres away. It was a delicate moment. But instead of shooing Mr Altan away, the father called him in.  
  

"Take pictures of my child," Mr Hancer called in a low, trembling voice.

### 'I was speechless'

The father wanted the world to see his — and his nation's — grief. And it did.  
  

The AFP photograph appeared on the front pages of major newspapers across the world, including the Financial Times and the Wall Street Journal.  
  

"As I took photos, I was so sad. I kept repeating to myself, 'what immense pain'. I couldn't stop myself from crying," Mr Altan recalled.  
  

"I was speechless."  
  

Mr Altan asked Hancer his name and then his daughter's name.

"He was speaking with difficulty, so I could not talk to him too much," Mr Altan said.  
  

Mr Altan could not ask too many questions because everyone needed to observe silence to hear whether there were survivors underneath the rubble.  
  

A photographer for 40 years, including 15 with AFP, Mr Altan knew that the photograph represented Turkey's pain.  
  

But its global impact surprised him. It has been shared hundreds of thousands of times online.  
  

Mr Altan has received thousands of messages from people worldwide, wanting to offer support.  
  

"Many told me they will never forget this image," he said.  

### Hope for more survivors fades

Cold, hunger and despair gripped hundreds of thousands of people left homeless after the earthquakes that struck Turkey and Syria three days ago as the death toll passed 20,000 on Thursday.  
  

The rescue of a 2-year-old boy after 79 hours trapped in the rubble of a collapsed building in Hatay, Turkey, and several other people raised spirits among weary search crews. But hopes were fading that many more would be found alive in the ruins of towns and cities.  
  

The death toll across both countries has now surpassed the more than 17,000 killed in 1999 when a similarly powerful quake hit northwest Turkey.

A Turkish official said the disaster posed "very serious difficulties" for the holding of an election scheduled for 14 May in which President Tayyip Erdogan has been expected to face his toughest challenge in two decades in power.  
  

With anger simmering over delays in the delivery of aid and getting the rescue effort underway, the disaster is likely to play into the vote if it goes ahead.  
  

The first United Nations convoy carrying aid to stricken Syrians crossed over the border from Turkey.

In Syria's Idlib province, Munira Mohammad, a mother of four who fled Aleppo after the quake, said: "It is all children here, and we need heating and supplies, last night we couldn't sleep because it was so cold. It is very bad."  
  

Hundreds of thousands of people in both countries have been left homeless in the middle of winter. Many have camped out in makeshift shelters in supermarket car parks, mosques, roadsides or amid the ruins, often desperate for food, water and heat.  
  

Some 40 per cent of buildings in the Turkish city of Kahramanmaras, epicentre of the tremor, are damaged, according to a preliminary report by Turkey's Bogazici University.

Mesut Hancer holds the hand of his 15-year-old daughter Irmak, who died in the earthquake in Kahramanmaras, Turkey, close to the epicenter, on February 7.

CNN  — 

It’s been a week since a massive [7.8 magnitude earthquake](https://cnn.com/2023/02/07/middleeast/earthquake-turkey-syria-why-deadly-intl/index.html)
 rocked [Turkey](https://cnn.com/2023/02/11/middleeast/turkey-syria-earthquake-recovery-intl/index.html)
 and [Syria](https://cnn.com/2023/02/08/middleeast/syria-left-behind-earthquake-mime-intl/index.html)
, claiming the lives of more than [36,000](https://cnn.com/middleeast/live-news/turkey-syria-earthquake-updates-2-13-23-intl/index.html)
 people. Many tens of thousands more have been injured. Millions may be left homeless.

Few images have captured the devastation of the past week as starkly as a photograph of Mesut Hancer.

He was photographed holding the hand of his 15-year-old daughter, Irmak, under the rubble in the southern Turkish city of Kahramanmaras, near the epicenter of the quake. He said she died at the moment it hit, with no chance of escape.

In an interview with CNN Turk Saturday, Hancer spoke about the lives behind the image that has come to define last week’s tragic disaster.

Irmak had been visiting her grandmother, Hancer said, and he spent three days trying to free her body from the rubble.

“It was awful. As soon as I heard the news, I rushed there. And with my own bare hands, with my own means, with great effort I tried to pull out my daughter. However, unfortunately, I couldn’t save my daughter,” Hancer said.

“Losing a mother, a father or siblings aside, losing a child is on another level of despair,” he said.

When Hancer arrived at the wreckage, the terrible reality of the situation became apparent.

![Seven members of his family ended up under the rubble, Hancer told CNN Turk.](https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230207121217-06-earthquake-020723-kahramanmaras-turkey.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill)

Seven members of his family ended up under the rubble, Hancer told CNN Turk.

“I didn’t have hope because there was a large girder on my daughter. Her waist up was free but below her waist under the rubble,” she was crushed, he said. “Unfortunately, during the earthquake, she died right there and then. She didn’t have a chance of survival.”

Hancer said he spent three days trying to free his daughter’s body from the rubble.

“With my own effort, with my own means, I reached her. I couldn’t ask anyone \[for help\], because there are a lot of people under the rubble,” he said.

The death toll in Turkey has reached 31,643, Turkish Emergency Coordination Center SAKOM said Monday. The confirmed death toll in Syria is 4,574.

[Rescue efforts](https://cnn.com/2023/02/10/middleeast/turkey-syria-earthquake-intl/index.html)
 continue in both countries, but authorities have been overwhelmed by the sheer scale of the disaster. More than [5,700 buildings](https://cnn.com/2023/02/08/middleeast/turkey-earthquake-public-anger-intl/index.html)
 in Turkey have collapsed, according to the country’s disaster agency.

“I also talked with AFAD \[the Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency in Turkey\], and they helped as much as they could. But they said they could not provide an excavator to that area,” Hancer said.

Hancer is grieving not only for his daughter. The earthquake struck when members of his family had traveled across Turkey to his mother’s house, where his daughter was staying.

“My mother, my two older brothers, my sister-in-law and her little daughter. There were seven people including my daughter. They were all under the rubble,” Hancer said.

Hancer’s home has also been badly damaged, he said, adding that he doesn’t have anywhere to stay. “We cannot enter our house because we don’t have the means. We are left outside.”

Thousands of families are facing similar grief and devastation.

Meanwhile, amid growing public anger over the government’s response to the disaster, Turkish authorities have carried out a wave of arrests of property developers accused of “negligence” over building collapses due to last week’s earthquake.

.

Background
----------

The Nuseirat refugee camp was established in the Gaza Strip after the [Palestinians were expelled or fled from Israel](/wiki/1948_Palestinian_expulsion "1948 Palestinian expulsion")
 during the [1948 Palestine war](/wiki/1948_Palestine_war "1948 Palestine war")
. On 7 October 2023, the Qassam Brigades (the militant wing of the [Hamas](/wiki/Hamas "Hamas")
 party) launched [an attack on Israel](/wiki/2023_Hamas-led_attack_on_Israel "2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel")
.[\[23\]](#cite_note-25)
 As part of the attack, in which other Palestinian militant groups were also involved, Hamas, [Palestinian Islamic Jihad](/wiki/Palestinian_Islamic_Jihad "Palestinian Islamic Jihad")
 and other Palestinian militant groups kidnapped 251 Israeli civilians and soldiers.[\[24\]](#cite_note-rw10oct-26)
 This attack led to the [Gaza war](/wiki/Gaza_war "Gaza war")
.[\[24\]](#cite_note-rw10oct-26)

The [Nuseirat refugee camp](/wiki/Nuseirat_refugee_camp "Nuseirat refugee camp")
 is a long-standing [UNRWA](/wiki/UNRWA "UNRWA")
 refugee camp located in the middle of the Gaza Strip, in [Deir al-Balah](/wiki/Deir_al-Balah "Deir al-Balah")
.[\[25\]](#cite_note-27)
 The camp has been repeatedly bombed during the Israel-Hamas war, with over a hundred Palestinians killed in the attacks. [Ynet](/wiki/Ynet "Ynet")
 reported that she also cooked at times with basic ingredients she was provided.[\[36\]](#cite_note-toimalnutrition-38)

The [Qassam Brigades](/wiki/Qassam_Brigades "Qassam Brigades")
 (the militant wing of the Hamas movement) claimed that three other hostages were killed as a result of the raid.[\[22\]](#cite_note-AJ_-_3_killed-24)
[\[41\]](#cite_note-43)
 They did not name any of them, or show photographs, but they claimed that one of the three was a US citizen and released a short video with text in Arabic, Hebrew, and English.[\[22\]](#cite_note-AJ_-_3_killed-24)
 The video depicted three unidentifiable corpses with their faces obscured by censor bars.[\[42\]](#cite_note-44)
 The Brigades did not give details of how the hostages supposedly died, but said they were killed by the Israeli military.[\[c\]](#cite_note-46)

> "In exchange for them, your own army killed 3 of your own captives in the same attack; one of them holds a USA citizenship" - Qassam Brigades, 9 June 2024.[\[22\]](#cite_note-AJ_-_3_killed-24)

Rescue
------

The IDF said that they worked with [Shin Bet](/wiki/Shin_Bet "Shin Bet")
 and Israeli police to free the four Israeli hostages.[\[44\]](#cite_note-ynet8june-47)
 It was also later reported that the operation was [aided by intelligence support from the United States](/wiki/United_States_support_for_Israel_in_the_Gaza_war "United States support for Israel in the Gaza war")
[\[45\]](#cite_note-cbs8junebrennan-48)

.[\[46\]](#cite_note-49)
 The operation was planned for several weeks, and was carried out after an intelligence opportunity arose.[\[14\]](#cite_note-bbc-16)
 Some of the special forces members entered the refugee camp in a vehicle with a mattress on top, posing as [Palestinian refugees](/wiki/Gaza_Strip_evacuations "Gaza Strip evacuations")

 by the Israeli military since the Gaza war began in early October.

At least 38,098 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli attacks across Gaza since October 7 and the besieged enclave faces dire shortages of food, water, medicine and other humanitarian supplies.

On Saturday, dozens of Palestinians, [including five journalists](/news/2024/7/6/five-journalists-killed-as-israel-steps-up-bombardment-across-gaza)
, were killed as the Israeli military stepped up its bombardment of the territory.

Videos taken at the scene of the attack on the UNRWA school-turned-shelter in Nuseirat showed twisted metal at the collapsed building. Emergency workers also tried to cover two bodies as they were quickly brought into the medical complex.

The Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza said in a statement that 50 injured Palestinians were taken to the hospital.

In a [statement](https://x.com/IDF/status/1809662855660360020)
 shared on social media on Saturday night, the Israeli army said its air force “struck several terrorists” in the area of al-Jaouni school.

Reporting from Deir el-Balah, Al Jazeera’s Hind Khoudary said hundreds of Palestinian families had sought shelter at the school after they were forced to flee Israel’s bombardment in other parts of Gaza.

The families “chose the middle area \[of the Gaza Strip\] because Israeli forces said the middle area is a safe zone”, Khoudary said.

“Everyone in the Gaza Strip believes that they are not safe, wherever they go.”

Last month, an Israeli attack on an UN-linked school – also in Nuseirat refugee camp – [killed at least 40 people](/news/2024/6/6/israel-bombs-unrwa-school-in-gaza-kills-32-displaced-palestinians)

“Concrete slabs fell on us, and suddenly, we found ourselves surrounded by the dead and injured. All of my family members were either injured or killed,” [Musab said](https://www.unrwa.org/newsroom/features/no-shelter-war-bombing-block-2-unrwa-nuseirat-school)
 in testimony shared by UNRWA.

“We were sleeping, and at two in the morning, missiles rained down on us. A young boy could be seen sifting through pools of blood on the ground.

Footage shot at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in nearby Deir el-Balah and verified by Al Jazeera’s Sanad agency also showed children and young people being rushed from ambulances.

They included a girl with a bandaged arm, another with a bloodied face and a boy bandage across his head. They pulled us from under the rubble, and all we saw were shrapnel, debris, and dust. How will we live?”

Israeli air strike on Gaza school kills at least 16

Shock and horror at scene of Gaza blast

**At least 16 people have been killed in an Israeli air strike on a UN-run school in the Gaza Strip, Palestinian officials have said. Dozens more have been injured.**

The building was sheltering thousands of displaced people at Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.

Israel said it had struck several Hamas “terrorists operating in structures located in the area of Al-Jaouni School”.

A local source said the target was a room allegedly used by Hamas police. A spokeswoman for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) said the claims were "very, very serious" and should be investigated.

The attack comes as [hopes rise that a deal between Israel and Hamas is on the horizon](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c3gvp5q9y2go)
, following months of false starts.

Israel has announced it will send a team of negotiators next week to discuss a hostage release deal with Hamas.

It comes after a senior US administration official said Hamas had agreed to "pretty significant adjustments" to its position regarding a potential ceasefire.

A senior Hamas source told the Reuters news agency on Saturday that the group had agreed to begin talks on releasing Israeli hostages 16 days after the proposed first phase of an agreement aimed at ending the Gaza war.

Video from the scene of the Nuseirat school strike shows adults and children screaming in a smoke-filled street covered in dust and rubble, as they run to help the wounded.

Eyewitnesses told the BBC that the attack targeted the upper floors of the school, which is located near a busy market.

The BBC understands that up to 7,000 people were using the building as shelter.

One woman told the AFP news agency how some children were killed as they were reading the Koran when the building was hit.

"This is the fourth time they have targeted the school without warning," she said.

Hamas said five local journalists were among those killed in Israeli attacks on Saturday. Many were women and children."

She added it was not the first time Israel had made such claims, and that they should be investigated.

A previous attack in June on another packed UN-run school in Nuseirat [killed at least 35 people](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/crggq0jygq6o)
.

Local journalists told the BBC at the time that a warplane fired two missiles at classrooms on the top floor of the school.

After that attack, Israel’s military said it had “conducted a precise strike on a Hamas compound” in the school and killed many of the 20 to 30 fighters it believed were inside.

The head of the Unrwa described the June incident as "horrific" and said the claim that armed groups might have been inside a shelter was "shocking" but could not be confirmed.

Israel’s war was triggered by Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people and took 251 others back to Gaza as hostages.

At least 38,098 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza as a result of Israel's offensive, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.

Israel has regularly accused Unrwa of supporting Hamas, which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK, US and other countries.

The organisation has rejected this.

In April, a UN investigation found Israel had failed to back up a claim that many of the agency's staff belonged militant groups, but also said it could improve its neutrality, staff vetting and transparency.

At least 50 people were injured in the strike, Gaza officials say.

In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed it had hit the school buildings, saying it had taken "numerous steps" to "mitigate the risk of harming civilians, including the use of precise aerial surveillance and additional intelligence".

Hamas militants were using the location as a "hideout" to carry out attacks against IDF troops, it said.

"Hamas continues to systematically violate international law by exploiting civilian structures and the civilian population as human shields for its terrorist attacks against the State of Israel," it added.

Hamas called the attack a “massacre” on “defenceless displaced civilians”.

Many of the dead and wounded were women, children and the elderly, the group claimed via its English language Telegram channel.

The IDF said it was "looking into the details" of the incident.

Many schools and other UN facilities have been used as shelters by the 1.7 million people who have fled their homes during the war, which has lasted almost eight months.

"We don’t have all the information yet. <image:2684>!Reuters People walk through the ruins of a school that was hit by an airstrike, killing at least 16 people. Since the war began, we have had more than half of our facilities hit," Juliette Touma, Unrwa's communications director, told the BBC regarding the latest attack.

"Many of them were shelters, and as a result at least 500 people sheltering in those facilities have been killed. Members of their family were also reportedly targeted.

More than 100 journalists have lost their lives in Gaza since the 7 October attacks, according to Reporters Without Borders.

Hamas said the five latest fatalities brings the number to 158.

The World Health Organization said on Wednesday it carried out its largest medical evacuation from Gaza since the start of the war, taking 97 sick and severely injured patients and 155 companions to the United Arab Emirates for treatment. The patients were 45 children and 52 adults with a wide range of conditions, including cancer and other diseases and injuries from the conflict.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO's director-general, [said](https://x.com/DrTedros/status/1833976405149057277)
 the evacuation was a "highly complex operation" that was "completed under immense time pressure to bring all patients together."

A WHO [report](https://www.who.int/news/item/12-09-2024-who-analysis-highlights-vast-unmet-rehabilitation-needs-in-gaza/)

Sept. agency, UNRWA, says this is the fifth time the al-Jaouni school has been hit since the start of the war. Philippe Lazzarini, the UNRWA Commissioner-General, said humanitarian staff are being “disregarded” in the Gaza war.

United States vetoes Gaza ceasefire resolution at Security Council
==================================================================

20 November 2024 [Peace and Security](/en/news/topic/peace-and-security)

The United States on Wednesday vetoed a UN Security Council draft resolution that demanded an immediate and unconditional ceasefire in the Gaza Strip.

Despite having secured 14 votes in favour, the draft resolution put forward by the 10 elected members of the [Security Council](https://main.un.org/securitycouncil/)
 (E10), failed to pass owing to the negative vote by a permanent member, the US.

The text also reiterated the Council’s demand for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages.

For a resolution to be adopted, it must secure at least nine votes in favour, and no negative votes – or vetoes – by any of the five permanent members.

Under the [UN Charter](http://www.un.org/en/charter-united-nations/index.html)
, the Security Council has the primary responsibility to uphold international peace and security.

The US representative Ambassador Robert Wood said in his statement that the US could not support an unconditional ceasefire unless it was tied to releasing the hostages being held in Gaza by Hamas and other militants. 

Had the draft resolution been adopted, it would have demanded immediate access for civilians in the Gaza Strip to basic services.

It would have rejected “any effort to starve Palestinians” – the threat of famine grows in the north as the Israeli siege there continues – while also demanding the facilitation of full, rapid, safe and unhindered entry of aid at scale to and throughout the Strip and its delivery to all those in need.

The text also demanded that the parties “fully, unconditionally, and without delay” implement all the provisions of Security Council resolution 2735 (2024).

This includes the release of hostages, the exchange of Palestinian prisoners, the return of the remains of hostages who have been killed, the return of Palestinian civilians to their homes and neighbourhoods in all areas of Gaza – including in the north – and a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.

The draft further underscored the role of the UN relief agency for Palestine refugees ([UNRWA](https://www.unrwa.org/)
) as the backbone of the humanitarian response in Gaza.

It called on all parties to enable UNRWA to carry out its mandate as adopted by the General Assembly, with full respect for the humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality, and independence.

It also urged respect for international humanitarian law, including the protection of UN and humanitarian facilities, while welcoming the Secretary-General’s and UNRWA’s commitment to fully implement the recommendations of an independent review of the agency led by former French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna.

Vote on a Draft Resolution on the War in Gaza\*
===============================================

Tomorrow morning (20 November), the Security Council is expected to vote on a draft resolution on the [war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/middle-east-including-the-palestinian-question/)
, which was put forward by the Council’s ten elected members (E10). (For background on the situation in Gaza, see the [brief](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/monthly-forecast/2024-11/the-middle-east-including-the-palestinian-question-18.php)
 on “The Middle East, including the Palestinian Question” in our November 2024 _Monthly Forecast_ and our 11 November _What’s in Blue_ [story](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2024/11/briefing-on-risk-of-famine-in-northern-gaza.php)
.)

_Negotiations on the Draft Resolution_

Negotiations on the draft resolution were difficult, with several Council members apparently disappointed with the low level of ambition of the draft text in blue following various compromises made in an attempt to secure an abstention from the US, Israel’s key ally at the Security Council. Similarly to the press statement, the draft text in blue does not include language “rejecting” actions undermining UNRWA’s mandate, but underscores that UNRWA “remains the backbone” of the humanitarian response in Gaza, calls on all parties to enable UNRWA to carry out its mandate, and welcomes the Secretary-General’s and UNRWA’s commitment to implement the recommendations of an independent review which evaluated UNRWA’s adherence to neutrality principles.

At the same time, a request from the US for language establishing a standing mechanism to review allegations raised by Israel regarding UNRWA employees being affiliated with Hamas was not included in the draft resolution. The remaining 14 members voted in favour.

#### Subscribe to receive SCR publications The frustrations of these members are apparently deepened by the possibility of the US still using its veto tomorrow.

It seems that during the 16 October [closed consultations](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2024/10/the-middle-east-including-the-palestinian-question-briefing-and-consultations-on-the-situation-in-northern-gaza.php)
 on “The situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian question”, Algeria asked Guyana, as the E10 coordinator for the month of October, to start consultations on a new Security Council product on the war in Gaza. This position is close to the long-held US stance that the two calls should be linked in line with the US position in the indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas. This revision was apparently a key factor for Japan in joining the other elected members in sponsoring the draft resolution.

However, the US apparently still found that this formulation, which had been used to overcome similar differences during the [negotiations](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2024/03/the-middle-east-including-the-palestinian-question-yesterdays-adoption-and-todays-briefing-and-consultations.php)
 on resolution 2728, fell short of its request for an explicit conditional link between the two demands, such as the one featured in resolution 2735. At the time of writing, it was unclear whether the US will accept this compromise and the draft in blue remains unchanged.

Language on persons detained by the parties still features virtually unchanged in the draft in blue, but as a stand-alone paragraph, which apparently reflects a US request not to suggest “an equivalence” between the hostages taken in Israel held captive by Palestinian armed groups and Palestinians prisoners detained by Israel by addressing them in the same paragraph.

Another major issue of contention was language in the early drafts of the resolution determining—in line with [Article 39](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/un-charter/chapter-7)
 of the UN Charter—that the situation in the Gaza Strip and the regional escalation constitute a threat to international peace and security. It seems, however, that the US still sought the deletion of this language, a request that was not reflected in the draft in blue.

It appears that the US also objected to language recalling the provisional orders of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in South Africa’s [case](https://www.icj-cij.org/case/192)
 against Israel on the Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide in the Gaza Strip. It also rejects “any effort to starve Palestinians” and demands immediate access to basic services and humanitarian assistance for civilians in Gaza, and the facilitation of entry of humanitarian assistance at scale and its delivery, including to “civilians in besieged north Gaza”.

_Background_

This will be the twelfth time the Security Council votes on a draft resolution on the war in Gaza."

Content: "could not support the unconditional ceasefire that failed to release the hostages.  “We heard that some desired the US veto rather than a consensus product,” he observed, emphasizing that his Government has done more than any other country to improve the humanitarian conditions in Gaza.

“The draft resolution this Council failed to adopt today sought only to break its deafening silence,” stressed Algeria’s delegate, noting that the text, although far from ideal, represented a “bare minimum that should have united us”.  Instead, today’s message to Israel is that “you may continue your genocide” and “in this Chamber, you enjoy immunity”, he said, adding that the message to Palestinians is also clear:  “While the overwhelming majority of the world stands in solidarity with your plight, tragically, others remain indifferent to your suffering.”

The representative of the Russian Federation stated:  “We will not allow the United States to muzzle the voice of the Council and continue emboldening further merciless operations by Israel”, calling Washington, D.C.’s “cold and cynical” opposition to saving lives — “inhumane”.  “You today have definitively shown that you are fully responsible for the death of tens of thousands of innocent civilians,” he continued, observing that, if adopted, the resolution would have sent a clear signal to the parties to end violence and move to a diplomatic settlement.

In the same vein, China’s delegate said that the United States’ long use of the veto has dashed the hope of people of Gaza of survival.  Noting that “so-called” diplomatic negotiations — conducted by the United States — have seen no progress, he observed that its continued weapons supply has become a decisive factor in the war lasting so long.  “Insistence on setting a precondition to ceasefire is tantamount to giving a green light to continuing war”, he said, stating that Israel’s military operation has long exceeded the scope of rescuing hostages.

Meanwhile, the representative of Ecuador pointed out that, for the second time in 2024, the 10 elected Council members “accepted the challenge” of drafting a text that would be acceptable to all the organ’s members and would allow it to fulfil its responsibilities “in the face of a pressing situation”.  “Fourteen votes in favour are a clear indication that the draft resolution put forward was ‘timely and appropriate’”, he stated. Adding to that France’s delegate stated that “international humanitarian law is being trampled underfoot”.

“There is an entire generation of children in Gaza we are failing,” lamented Slovenia’s delegate, joined by the representatives of the Republic of Korea and Malta in regretting the non-adoption of the text.  Japan’s representative added that without collective action, “children in Gaza — the future of Gaza — will continue to pay the high price of this conflict”. For his part, Sierra Leone’s delegate emphasized that, if adopted, the text would have allowed the Council to “unite its strength to save humanity from destruction”.

Offering a different perspective, the speaker for Switzerland underscored that Israel, as an occupying Power, has a duty to ensure that the basic needs in the occupied Palestinian territories are met.  “Israel must take urgent action to alleviate this crisis,” stressed the United Kingdom’s delegate, Council President for November, speaking in her national capacity. Voicing regret that consensus was not reached, she affirmed her country’s unwavering commitment to realize the vision of the text.

However, the representative of Israel said that today’s resolution was not a path to peace — “it was a road map to more terror, more suffering and more bloodshed”. “Many of you attempted to pass this injustice,” he added, thanking the United States for using its veto and refusing to abandon the hostages and their families.  Had the text passed, the Council would have sent a message to the world that terrorists can act with impunity and would have “validated their \[Hamas\] strategy of using human shields, targeting civilians and tormenting hostages in their terror dungeons”.

Further, “it would have set a horrifying precedent that terrorism pays”, he said — “that violence is met not with condemnation, but with concessions”.  The Council has already adopted four resolutions demanding the release of hostages, and Hamas has ignored them all.  While the loss of civilian life in Gaza is a tragedy, he stressed that “it is a tragedy authored by Hamas”.  He concluded:  “If Hamas were to release the hostages and surrender their weapons, not one more shot would need to be fired; but, until that day comes, Israel will do whatever it takes to protect its people and bring our loved ones home.”

“The world should not grow accustomed to the death of Palestinians,” stressed the observer of the State of Palestine, adding:  “Maybe — for some — we have the wrong nationality, the wrong faith, the wrong skin colour; but we are humans, and we should be treated as such.”  Although a ceasefire “doesn’t resolve everything, but it is the first step to resolving anything”, he said.  Questioning whether international law applies differently to Israel than to the rest of the world, he asked:  “What the hell does Israel need to do more for this Council to act under Chapter VII?”  The world is witnessing an attempt to annihilate a nation, and yet the very tools designed to respond to such a situation are not being used. 

“This self-inflicted powerlessness has to stop,” he urged.  The message that would have been sent by today’s resolution — trying to save lives — was not a dangerous one; rather, its veto is a dangerous message to Israel that it can continue executing its plans.  “And the messages we send do matter, and that is the wrong message at the worst possible time,” he stressed.  Adding that, one day, people will examine the records of these meetings and wonder how a genocide known to the whole world was able to continue for so long, he stated:  “It is because we are allowed to speak about the rules, but not to enforce them.”

Security Council Fails to Adopt Resolution Demanding Immediate Ceasefire in Gaza, as United States Casts Negative Vote
======================================================================================================================

The Security Council today failed to adopt a text, put forward by its 10 elected members, that called for an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Gaza and demanded the release of all hostages, on account of a negative vote cast by a permanent member.

Introducing the draft resolution, the representative of Guyana said the text was prompted by the Council’s deep concern over the catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza and a need for an urgent response.  She observed that the release of hostages is one of the most important provisions of the text.  Spotlighting broad consensus, she noted that, while several divergent positions have found a balance in the text, the dominant concern has been to provide a legally binding obligation to end the hostilities.

Although the vote that followed garnered support for the resolution from 14 Council members, the text was not adopted due to a veto cast by the United States.

If adopted, the resolution would have demanded Gaza’s civilian population be given access to basic services, while it would have rejected any effort to starve Palestinians and would have demanded humanitarian assistance at scale.  Further, it would have also demanded the release of hostages, the exchange of Palestinian prisoners and the return of Palestinian civilians to all areas in Gaza, as it would have also underscored that the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) remains a backbone of humanitarian response.

However, the representative of the United States said that “this resolution would have sent a dangerous message to Hamas:  there is no need to come back to the negotiating table”, recalling that the group has rejected “deal after deal after deal”.  More so, Washington, D.C. Not an official record.

Conscription has faced strong opposition throughout American history from prominent figures like [Daniel Webster](/wiki/Daniel_Webster "Daniel Webster")

\]

In [colonial times](/wiki/Colonial_history_of_the_United_States "Colonial history of the United States")
, the [Thirteen Colonies](/wiki/Thirteen_Colonies "Thirteen Colonies")
 used a [militia](/wiki/Militia_(United_States) "Militia (United States)")
 system for defense. And when any individual or combination of individuals, undertakes to decide for any man when he shall work, where he shall work, at what he shall work, and for what he shall work, he or they practically reduce him to slavery."[\[15\]](#cite_note-15)

### National Guard

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Conscription_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: National Guard")\
\]

The [Militia Act of 1903](/wiki/Militia_Act_of_1903 "Militia Act of 1903")
 reorganized the federally supported state militias as the National Guard, aligning their training with active duty needs so they could be quickly put into federal service.

In 1933, Congress reorganized the National Guard under its [Article I enumerated power](/wiki/Enumerated_powers_(United_States) "Enumerated powers (United States)")
 to "raise and support armies" instead of its power to "Provide for organizing, arming and disciplining the Militia".[\[16\]](#cite_note-16)
 This avoids the constraint on federal militia service that it can only be used "to execute the laws of the Union, suppress insurrections and repel invasions."

Able-bodied men between the ages of 17 and 45 outside of the National Guard are defined in the Militia Act and under the laws of some states as the [unorganized militia](/wiki/Militia_(United_States)#Unorganized_militia "Militia (United States)")
, which may be called into state or federal service as needed.

In 1917, the administration of [President](/wiki/President_of_the_United_States "President of the United States")
 [Woodrow Wilson](/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson "Woodrow Wilson")
 decided to rely primarily on conscription, rather than voluntary enlistment, to raise military manpower for [World War I](/wiki/World_War_I "World War I")
 when only 73,000 volunteers enlisted out of the initial 1 million target in the first six weeks of the war.[\[17\]](#cite_note-17)
 One ascribed motivation was to thwart former president [Theodore Roosevelt](/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt "Theodore Roosevelt")
, who proposed raising a volunteer division, which would have upstaged Wilson. However, there is no evidence that Roosevelt had enough support to carry out that plan, and because Wilson had just started his second term, the former President's prospects for substantial political gain seemed dubious.

The [Selective Service Act of 1917](/wiki/Selective_Service_Act_of_1917 "Selective Service Act of 1917")
 was carefully drawn to remedy the defects in the Civil War system and—by allowing exemptions for dependency, essential occupations, and religious scruples—to place each man in his proper niche in a national war effort.[\[18\]](#cite_note-18)
 The act established a "liability for military service of all male citizens"; authorized a selective draft of all those between 21 and 31 years of age (later from 18 to 45); and prohibited all forms of bounties, substitutions, or purchase of exemptions. Baker")
 created the Board of Inquiry to question the conscientious objectors' sincerity.[\[24\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShenk200562-24)
 [Military tribunals](/wiki/Military_tribunals_in_the_United_States "Military tribunals in the United States")
 tried men found by the Board to be insincere for a variety of offenses, sentencing 17 to [death](/wiki/Capital_punishment "Capital punishment")
, 142 to [life imprisonment](/wiki/Life_imprisonment "Life imprisonment")
, and 345 to [penal labor](/wiki/Penal_labor "Penal labor")
 camps.[\[24\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShenk200562-24)
 Many of these sentences were commuted after the war's end.

In 1917, a number of radicals and [anarchists](/wiki/Anarchists "Anarchists")
, including [Emma Goldman](/wiki/Emma_Goldman "Emma Goldman")
, tried to challenge the new draft law in federal court, arguing that it was a direct violation of the [Thirteenth Amendment](/wiki/Thirteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution "Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution")
's prohibition against [slavery and involuntary servitude](/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States "Slavery in the United States")
. Congress further tweaked this act in 1950 although the post–World War II surplus of military manpower left little need for draft calls until [President Truman's](/wiki/Harry_S._Truman "Harry S. On numerous occasions, General Hershey told Congress that for every man drafted, three or four more were scared into volunteering.[\[49\]](#cite_note-49)
[\[50\]](#cite_note-50)
 Assuming that his assessment was accurate, this would mean that more than 11 million men volunteered for service because of the draft between January 1954 and April 1975.[\[29\]](#cite_note-autogenerated2-29)

The policy of using the draft to incentivize voluntary enlistment was unique in American history. During the active combat phase, the possibility of avoiding combat by selecting their service and military specialty led as many as four out of 11 eligible men to enlist.[\[53\]](#cite_note-Useem-53)
[\[54\]](#cite_note-54)
 The military relied upon draft-induced volunteerism to meet its quotas, especially for the Army, which accounted for nearly 95% of all inductees during the Vietnam War era. If drafted, they would only serve for two years, but would have no choice over their military occupational specialty.[\[68\]](#cite_note-68)

Of the nearly 16 million men not engaged in active military service, 96% were exempted (typically because of jobs including other military service), deferred (usually for educational reasons), or disqualified (usually for physical and mental deficiencies but also for criminal records including draft violations).[\[29\]](#cite_note-autogenerated2-29)
 The requirements for obtaining and maintaining an educational deferment changed several times in the late 1960s. Gates initially opposed the all-volunteer army idea but changed his mind during the course of the 15-member commission's work.[\[73\]](#cite_note-aitken-73)
 The Gates Commission issued its report in February 1970, describing how adequate military strength could be maintained without having conscription.[\[71\]](#cite_note-evans-71)
[\[76\]](#cite_note-griffith-76)
 The existing draft law was expiring at the end of June 1971, but the Department of Defense and Nixon administration decided the draft needed to continue for at least some time.[\[76\]](#cite_note-griffith-76)
 In February 1971, the administration requested Congress to extend the draft for two years, to June 1973.[\[77\]](#cite_note-nyt020371-77)
[\[78\]](#cite_note-black-78)

Senatorial opponents of the war wanted to reduce this to a one-year extension, eliminate the draft altogether, or tie the draft renewal to a timetable for troop withdrawal from Vietnam;[\[79\]](#cite_note-nyt060571-79)
 Senator [Mike Gravel](/wiki/Mike_Gravel "Mike Gravel")
 of [Alaska](/wiki/Alaska "Alaska")
 took the most forceful approach, trying to [filibuster](/wiki/Filibuster "Filibuster")
 the draft renewal legislation, shut conscription down, and directly force an end to the war.[\[80\]](#cite_note-80)
 Senators supporting Nixon's war efforts supported the bill even though some had qualms about ending the draft.[\[78\]](#cite_note-black-78)
 After a prolonged battle in the Senate, a September 1971 [cloture](/wiki/Cloture "Cloture")
 was achieved over the filibuster, and the draft renewal bill was approved.[\[81\]](#cite_note-nyt092271-81)
 Meanwhile, military pay was increased as an incentive to attract volunteers, and television advertising for the U.S."

# Your Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The Wikipedia article "Conscription in the United States" details the history of the draft in the US, including its use in World War I, World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. It provides statistics on the number of draftees during these conflicts. The article also mentions the Selective Service System and the legal framework for conscription, including the role of the National Guard and the unorganized militia. It does not mention the US reinstituting the draft in 2024.

The United Nations Security Council failed to adopt a resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza due to a veto by the United States on November 20, 2024. The resolution, supported by 14 Council members, also demanded the release of hostages and access to basic services for Gaza's civilian population.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The United Nations News published an article on November 20, 2024, stating that the United States vetoed a UN Security Council draft resolution demanding an immediate and unconditional ceasefire in the Gaza Strip (<image:1>). The Security Council Report published on November 19, 2024, discusses a draft resolution on the war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas. The US was expected to vote on the draft resolution on November 20.

The United Nations Security Council failed to adopt a resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza due to a veto by the United States on November 20, 2024. The resolution, supported by 14 Council members, also demanded the release of hostages and access to basic services for Gaza's civilian population.

Unusually well-kempt American draftees report for duty at Fort Slocum, Long Island, during the national call to arms in June 1917.

In an effort to bolster the dwindling number of volunteers—only 300,000 had come forward by 1916—the Military Service Act became law in Canada on July 6, 1917. Some were lucky like me, but many, certainly most, were kidnapped by government and compelled, at great cost to serve as quasi-slaves.

### Mobilizing America for the Second World War

After the war, Congress consistently declined to extend the system of military draft or compulsory service. Draftees were sorted into a variety of classifications from I-A, designating those who were fit and available immediately for military service; to I-A-O, which identified a conscientious objector available for military service in a noncombat role; to IV-F, for those who were physically or “morally” unfit. During the Vietnam era, from August 1964 through February 1973, a total of 1,857,304 young American men had been pressed into military service through the Selective Service system.

Although the draft had ended and the American armed forces had become an all-volunteer enterprise, the requirement for young men to register for the draft remained in effect until it was also suspended in April 1975. Whether that has been a fundamental blessing to mankind, or a curse, remains very much an open question.

Unlike many celebrities, **Johnson** does not appear to be showing a clear allegiance with either side of the conflict, although, whilst mentioning the loss of Palestinian lives, he does not specifically mention the Israeli airstrikes on the Gaza Strip.

The airstrikes were launched in response to a sudden surprise attack from Hamas on Israeli towns near the border and a music festival in the desert where hundreds of young people were killed and many kidnapped.

Hollywood stars are showing their support for Israel, after Hamas launched a surprise attack this past weekend, firing thousands of rockets from Gaza that have killed at least 900 people with more than 100 civilians kidnapped and held hostage.

The attack, which occurred early Saturday morning on Shabbat and coincided with the Jewish high holiday of Simchat Torah, is being called “Israel’s 9/11” and is the deadliest day in Israel in 50 years. Gal Gadot, Madonna, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, Natalie Portman, Andy Cohen, Jamie Lee Curtis, Debra Messing, Amy Schumer, Sarah Silverman, Kris Jenner, Mindy Kaling and Meghan McCain are among the celebrities who have taken to social media to stand alongside Israel.

Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds have donated $1 million to help children in Israel and Gaza, sources tell _Variety_.

“I stand with Israel you should too,” [Gadot posted](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyHF5n1t322/)
. “The growing loss of innocent Israeli and Palestinian lives is heart wrenching as this war escalates to immense proportions.”

Madonna [posted a video](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyI29uYO0bh/?hl=en)
 on her Instagram showing footage of rockets and slain bodies on the streets of Israel. Nine American citizens are among the climbing death toll.

### Popular on Variety

Over the weekend, President Joe Biden condemned the terrorist attack and supported Israel’s right to defend itself. “The United States unequivocally condemns this appalling assault against Israel by Hamas terrorists from Gaza, and I made clear to Prime Minister Netanyahu that we stand ready to offer all appropriate means of support to the Government and people of Israel. “My Administration’s support for Israel’s security is rock solid and unwavering.”

Israel ordered a “complete siege” of Gaza on Monday, cutting off all electricity, food and water to the area. More than 500 Palestinians have been killed by Israel airstrikes, in response to the Hamas attack.

Now, some of Hollywood’s biggest stars are speaking up to lend their support to Israel. What a horrific day.”

Selma Blair, who is Jewish, commented on social media to offer her unwavering support to Israel and Jews around the world. I stand with Israel.”

 have showed strong signs of support, posting statements from the leagues’ official accounts to condemn terrorism and mourn the loss of lives in Israel.

Former New York Knicks star Amar’e Stoudemire — who converted to Judaism and is an Israeli-American citizen — [posted a video on Instagram](https://twitter.com/TheDunkCentral/status/1711152518045008120?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1711152518045008120%7Ctwgr%5E4c100637d6e5161037d549d6c23fa66d3555bc1b%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fnypost.com%2F2023%2F10%2F09%2Famare-stoudemire-rips-politicians-blm-over-israel-silence%2F)
 to denounce those are staying silent amid Hamas’ attacks on Jews.

“I woke up, man, this morning with some disturbing news out of Israel — that Hamas kidnapping children, putting them in cages, killing women, killing the elderly. I pray that all involved are able to find a resolution.”)

WME said it will [match employee donations](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyO3Tcqy1nm/?hl=en&img_index=1)

The Royals have also lent their support to Israel.

Content: "5 when the words “Fuck Israel” were painted over a Pride flag painted the previous day. 

The rock was originally painted with the Palestinian flag on May 21 as part of a [protest](https://www.michigandaily.com/news/hundreds-march-across-ann-arbor-in-solidarity-with-palestine/)
 in support of Palestinian people, according the LSA junior Salma Hamamy said. “We are met, time and time again, with people coming to paint over the rock and silence our voices and write hateful messages, yet no one ever says anything.”

Hamamy was part of a WhatsApp groupchat of a few dozen Arab students who were the ones mainly responsible for the Palestinian paintings on the rock, she said. 

Pro-Israel messages on the Rock included “Israel wants peace” and “Stop Jewish hate” painted in the blue and white colors of the Israeli flag, as well as stars of David that represent both the flag and the Jewish faith.  

The paint disputes extended beyond just the Rock. They were just very persistent about covering up the Israel flag.” 

After an argument, Stoloff and Kalonymos came to the agreement that Kalonymos could paint over the Israeli flag with white spray paint, which would later be covered by the pride flag wrapped around the entire rock. 

“We didn’t want anything to escalate, so we agreed,” Kalonymos said, “So my friends and I painted this light box with Palestinian civil flags. When Hamamy’s WhatsApp group chat saw the Pride flag, it was agreed that there would be no more painting of the rock during Pride month. 

Saturday morning, Stoloff got out of the shower and opened her phone to a text with an image of the Rock. <image:2712>
    
    The Rock was painted with pro-Palestinian messages on May 21, 2021. <image:2714>

Several celebrities are using social media to show support for Israel and denounce Hamas’ attack on Israeli civilians which left at least 1,000 people dead.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From [Gal Gadot](https://www.hindustantimes.com/entertainment/hollywood/gal-gadot-reacts-to-israeli-palestine-conflict-101696757328407.html)
, Sonam Kapoor, [Gigi Hadid](https://www.hindustantimes.com/entertainment/hollywood/what-is-gigi-hadid-and-bella-hadids-connection-with-palestine-mohamed-anwar-hadid-101697011221005.html)
 to Dwayne Johnson, celebrities are taking to social media to show their support for [Israel](https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indias-position-vis-a-vis-israel-palestine-conflict-101697021932828.html)
 amid the country’s declared war against [Hamas](https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israelpalestine-war-live-updates-hamas-jerusalem-benjamin-netanyahu-gaza-strip-lebanon-joe-biden-qatar-101696981753474.html)
 following the attack by the Palestinian militants last weekend. She re-posted a viral infographic via her Instagram Story that stated, “It is absolutely reasonable and logical to be opposed to the Israeli government’s treatment of Palestinians while simultaneously calling for the protection of Jews in Israel and around the world”.

Liev Schreiber
--------------

In his Instagram stories, the Ray Donovan star, 56, shared a post from the organisation StandWithUs, dedicated to opposing anti-semitism, which included an image of the Israeli flag and read, “Now and always, we stand with the people of Israel!” Below the post, he wrote, “We stand with the people of Israel and the IDF in their fight against Hamas and other terrorist groups. I also feel a responsibility to my Jewish friends to make it clear, as I have before: While I have hopes and dreams for Palestinians, none of them include the harm of a Jewish person,” she wrote on Instagram.

Dwayne Johnson
--------------

Actor Dwayne Johnson, aka The Rock, posted a long note, wherein he ‘condemned and denounced terrorism’. He wrote, “I stand with my Israeli friends in the face of these unprovoked, barbaric terrorist attacks. The sanctity of our common humanity will hopefully serve to heal the unimaginable wounds of division.

Memes of Israelis holding flags in front Dome of the Rock circulate on Facebook
===============================================================================

Palestinians and Jordanians to respond to this trend

Last updated: September 15, 2018 | 20:05

![Memes of Israelis holding flags in front Dome of the Rock circulate on Facebook](//media.assettype.com/gulfnews%2Fimport%2F2016%2F7%2F20%2F1_16a080e42e8.1865803_1200962361_16a080e42e8_large.jpg?w=480&auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max)

Ramallah: New facebook memes in which Israelis post photoshopped images of themselves with Israeli flags in front of the Dome of the Rock are doing rounds on the social media.

The Jewish Press reported that the trend began when Haim Brosh shared a photoshopped image of himself holding the Israeli flag in front of the Dome of the Rock, with the title of the Zionist song “Carry a flag unto Zion” and a call for the Israeli government to finally raise the Israeli flag on Al Haram Al Sharif.

The Israeli police arrested Brosh for half an hour for questioning and later advised him to cease his subversive activities and released him instantly.

“How bored are the Israel police,” Brosh wrote on his facebook page after his release.

Since then, images of many Israelis holding their flag in front of the Dome of the Rock are circulating on the social media with huge public support and the Israeli police incapable to even summon those people for questioning. “We will figure out the right response to answer to this fierce campaign,” he told Gulf News.

“Raising the Israeli flag on the Dome of the Rock is the Zionist lifetime dream that will never come true.”

He said that the speakers of Al Aqsa Mosque and the other mosques have been instructed to highlight the Muslim origin of Al Haram Al Sharif as a pure and undisputed Muslim property.

He said that after the Israeli occupation forces captured Al Haram Al Sharif in 1967 Mideast war, the Israeli government signed the status quo agreements according to which Jews are allowed to visit but banned from praying in the holy shrine.

Rabat – A disturbing leaked video came to light on Tuesday showing an Israeli police dog brutally attacking an elderly Palestinian woman inside her home during their raid of the Jabalia refugee camp several weeks ago.

The **[footage](https://www.instagram.com/p/C8rTeL6pF3M/?igsh=MWRhbzlyYm00Zjl4Ng==)
**, which was obtained by Al Jazeera, has sparked social media fury and widespread condemnation. Captured from a camera mounted on the dog, the video showed the 66-year-old woman screaming in terror as she was viciously attacked.

The elderly woman, identified as Dawlat Al Tanani, suffered severe injuries and fractures as a result of the brutal attack.

Speaking to Al Jazeera, she said that Israeli Occupation Forces (IOF) unleashed the dog on her because she was resisting eviction from her home.

“I refuse to be forced out of my house, nor will I abandon my home. So the Israelis set a dog on me, which bit me while I was sleeping in my bed. It dragged me and pulled me all the way to the entrance door,” the elderly woman said.

“Now I have a serious injury. There are no hospitals or anything to treat my injury. My hand is still untreated,” she added.

The incident has reinforced accusations against the IOF of perpetrating severe forms of torture and violence against civilians, contrasting sharply with its self-proclaimed status as “the most moral army in the world.”

Social media users have widely shared the video, expressing shock for the extent the IOF goes to inflict pain and suffering on Palestinians.

Many activists have pointed out that such actions, including the use of police dogs against civilians, have been a longstanding practice by the Israeli forces.

“Israel/Zionist Occupiers brutality clearly has no limits…training dogs to rape and attack Palestinians. The daily massacres (are) getting (more) gruesome by the day,” **[said](https://x.com/huda54112445811/status/1805989054044938370)

The IDF on Thursday refuted accusations that one of its canines attacked an old woman in Gaza. Qatar-based Al Jazeera published menacing photos showing the dog in an aggressive attack of the seemingly terrified resident of Jabaliya.

The military said one of its dogs was abducted by terrorists during the fighting in Gaza and was in their custody when the alleged attack occurred. It was later found killed and his body boobytrapped to explode on soldiers if they attempted to retrieve it.

A Paratrooper Division in search of terrorists sent the attack dog with its handler into a building where they were thought to be hiding. The dog did not return, nor were there sounds of struggle or explosions, the military told ynet. The troops set out to inspect the building remotely using drones. At first, the dog was nowhere to be found but it was later seen sprawled on the street.

The team managed to identify residual explosives coming from the dog's body. The explosives were removed from the dog, which was taken for burial in the canine cemetery in the Canine unit - Oketz base.

The footage published by Al-Jazeera includes segments from the camera installed on the dog, showing it attacking the elderly woman in her home. She appears to be struggling with the dog on her bed.

However, the IDF said that even though the dog shown in the video was indeed a member of the canine unit, it had been abducted by Hamas with its equipment.

"The incident occurred after the handler lost touch with his dog," the IDF said. "It never received orders to harm civilians." The military added that killing the dog and rigging its body was part of Hamas' cynical tactics.

The footage was passed on to Al-Jazeera by correspondent Anas Al Sharif, who covers the northern Gaza area and is affiliated with Hamas. He is a resident of Jabaliya whose home was bombed in an IDF attack, and his father was killed. He is known to accompany Hamas terrorists and document their battles in Jabaliya.

More than 100 dogs were deployed alongside Israeli forces during the aggression in Gaza that began in October 2023.

These dogs, part of the Oketz unit, have been lauded for their roles in military operations, with their stories often celebrated in Israeli media, just as stories of fallen or injured soldiers are shared.

But the celebration of these "warriors on four legs" glosses over the brutal reality of their involvement in the conflict.

Dogs from the Oketz unit played a key role in military raids, such as the attack on 70-year-old Dawlat al-Tanani in Jabalia camp, where one of the unit’s dogs savagely mauled her.

Another horrific incident occurred when a dog fatally attacked 24-year-old Mohammed Salah Bahar, a young man with Down syndrome, in his home in Gaza’s Shuja’iyya neighborhood.

History of Training
-------------------

The Oketz unit, known for its specialized training of attack dogs, has been increasingly deployed in operations against Palestinian civilians and prisoners.

Their role, however, has extended beyond Gaza. The dogs have reportedly been used in Israeli prisons, and there have been disturbing allegations of their involvement in torture.

A prisoner named Muhammad Arab, held in the Sde Teiman prison, reported that dogs were trained to assault detainees sexually, adding another layer of brutality to the treatment of prisoners under Israeli occupation.

The use of military dogs in this context is not new, but its intensification reflects a broader pattern of violence.

Since before the Nakba in 1948, dogs have played a role in the Zionist project’s colonial control over Palestinians.

The glorification of these "warriors on all fours" in Israeli media serves to mask their role in the ongoing suppression of Palestinians, a history that traces back decades and continues to evolve in the current conflict.

Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, military dogs were notably absent from the Israeli army's ranks, even as Jewish settlers brought new European breeds to Palestine in the wake of “Israel’s” establishment.

In 1974, the Israeli Occupation discreetly revived its military dog unit, although it remained largely secret for more than a decade.

This renewed focus on dogs was closely tied to the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which began in 1967.

As Israeli forces faced growing resistance from Palestinian guerrilla fighters, the army saw a need for trained dogs to assist with intelligence and counterinsurgency missions.

Unit 7142, the newly reconstituted dog unit, played a key role in supporting Military Intelligence Unit 269, later known as Sayeret Matkal, one of the Israeli occupation's most elite special forces units.

Trained dogs were deployed to assist in countering what the Israeli occupation referred to as "terrorist activity," which in practice often meant confronting Palestinian guerrillas.

Despite its early successes, Israeli military leadership remained divided on the effectiveness of military dogs. Unit 7142 continued to operate under the radar, with doubts about the "colonial dog" and its utility in official army units lingering within the higher ranks.

Weaponizing Dogs
----------------

Since the Israeli aggression on Gaza began on October 7, more than 100 dogs have played an integral role in Israeli operations in Gaza. Since the beginning of the war, dogs from this unit have worked alongside Israeli paratroopers and other forces.

According to a report by Yoav Zitun on the Ynet website, over 30 dogs from the unit have been killed, many due to explosives or gunfire.

Despite these losses, the unit’s size is expected to double in the coming years, as the army recognizes the tactical value of the dogs in Gaza.

The Oketz unit employs dogs equipped with advanced technology for both military operations and acts of retaliation.

On the battlefield, these dogs are trained to alert soldiers to potential dangers, such as explosives, and to scout sites like destroyed buildings or displaced homes.

One of their key roles is the detection of tunnels used by Palestinian resistance fighters. Equipped with cameras and eavesdropping devices, these dogs are often sent into tunnels ahead of human troops.

Sometimes, they even carry gas bombs that are triggered if the dog detects someone inside, turning the animal into a sacrificial tool.

Yet beyond these security functions, the dogs have also been deployed in brutal retaliatory actions.

The unit uses attack dogs—specifically trained German Shepherds and Dobermanns—whose role is to maul and kill humans.

There have been numerous reports of dogs attacking civilians, including graphic accounts of an elderly woman, Dawlat al-Tanani, in Jabalia camp, whose chest was torn apart by a military dog.

Testimonies from Gaza also describe how these dogs have been used as tools of psychological terror.

According to Fadi, a detainee released from the Sde Teiman camp, Israeli soldiers forced prisoners to endure sexual assaults by trained dogs.

Fadi’s testimony is one of many that highlight the level of dehumanization experienced by Palestinians during the war, with trained dogs playing a central role in this violence.

The story of a booby-trapped dog further underscores the grim interplay between human and canine sacrifice in this conflict.

This militarization of dogs in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict represents a deeper level of brutality, as these animals are used not only for tactical purposes but also as instruments of terror and revenge.![Israeli-reservists-pose-with-a-dog-they-brought-out-of-Gaza-in-December-2023.-Courtesy-of-Glass-Walls.jpg (1600×1000)](https://static.timesofisrael.com/www/uploads/2024/01/Israeli-reservists-pose-with-a-dog-they-brought-out-of-Gaza-in-December-2023.-Courtesy-of-Glass-Walls.jpg)

Striking Violations
-------------------

Last week, the Israeli newspaper _Haaretz_ released disturbing footage from Megiddo Prison, revealing scenes of abuse against Palestinian prisoners.

In the leaked video, inmates in the prison’s security wing were shown lying on the ground, hands bound, as a guard walked over them with a dog, an apparent act of humiliation.

The use of dogs as a tool for abuse has been a longstanding concern for human rights groups.

In June, the Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor issued a report highlighting the Israeli military’s deployment of police dogs in the Gaza Strip.

According to the report, these dogs are used not only in military operations but also to terrorize prisoners, subjecting them to mauling and, in some instances, sexual violence.

The organization documented numerous cases of dog attacks on civilians during Israeli raids, particularly on homes, hospitals, and shelters.

In some operations, the dogs are equipped with surveillance cameras to scout locations ahead of Israeli soldiers.

Civilians are often left defenseless as the dogs are set upon them, with soldiers standing by or even encouraging the attacks. This behavior has drawn international condemnation.

Jeremy Laurence, a spokesperson for the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, has called such actions "serious violations" of “Israel's legal obligations toward protected persons under the law of occupation.”

One particularly harrowing case involved Mohammed Bahar, a 24-year-old Palestinian man with Down syndrome.

During a military raid on Gaza’s Shuja’iyya neighborhood last July, a police dog attacked Bahar as he sat on a couch.

His mother recounted the brutal incident to Anadolu Agency, describing how the dog bit her son multiple times, causing fatal injuries.

In another incident from May, widely shared on social media, a police dog attacked 70-year-old Dawlat al-Tanani during an Israeli military operation in Jabalia camp, severely injuring her arm.

Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor has also documented the use of dogs in assaults on hospitals, including one attack in 2023 where dogs were unleashed on displaced civilians and even the bodies of the deceased. Another documented case occurred during an invasion of the Al-Shifa Medical Complex in March 2024.

The practice of using police dogs has not been limited to Gaza. In the West Bank, reports indicate a growing number of incidents in which dogs have been deployed during arrests and house raids, particularly against children.

WAFA, the Palestinian News Agency, has shared dozens of photos and videos showing soldiers setting dogs on civilians.

Human rights groups have labeled these attacks as a form of torture and degrading treatment, prohibited under international law.

Protests against this practice have spread beyond the region. On September 16, activists in the Netherlands demonstrated outside a K-9 training center in Oosterhout, demanding a halt to the export of police dogs to the Israeli military, which they claim are being used to target civilians.

The ongoing use of dogs in military operations has become a symbol of the broader human rights concerns surrounding Israel’s occupation, adding to the mounting calls for international accountability.

![Israeli-Army-Attack-with-Dog](/cached_uploads/resize/400/200/alhaq_files/images/stories/Images/Israeli-Army-Attack-with-Dog.jpg "An archived photo for illustration purposes of an Israeli army dog attacking  a Palestinian woman during an army raid in the West Bank village of Obadiyah, near Bethlehem. During last week, a woman and her 17-year-old son were attacked during an arrest operation.

### Amira Rahman ‘Awad

On 21 December, Israeli occupying forces unleashed an army dog on 47-year-old Amira Rahman ‘Awad during a raid on her sons’ house in Ithna, Hebron. In some cases, computers, documents and money are “confiscated” and furniture is destroyed.

House raids are also used by Israel as tactics of harassment, as was the case during the week of 14 – 20 November when the Israeli army raided the houses of Palestinian ex-prisoners to let them know they were being watched. The soldiers then called on Amira’s 17-year-old son Jarallah who went inside the house to put more clothes on.

Moments after the door to the house was wide open, the Israeli soldiers let loose an army dog described by Amira as being big and similar looking to a wolf. [Photo Credit: Photo: Kevin Frayer/AP]")The arbitrary arrest and detention of Palestinians by Israeli forces is a reoccurring issue in the weekly field reports gathered by Al-Haq. His demands were dismissed and no names were given to him.

Amira’s son Samer was released the next day at around 3:30 pm.

The arbitrary arrest and detention of Palestinians in the Occupied Palestinian Territory continues to infringe upon their human rights. The events took place at around 1:20 am when Israeli soldiers stormed into Amira’s house and threatened to bombard her sons’ house located across from hers. According to Amira, the soldiers came to arrest her eldest son Samer Issa ‘Awad (24 years old) who had served an eight-year sentence in an Israeli prison for being an active member of Hamas.

Issa Muhammad ‘Awad, Amira’s husband told the soldiers that his son Samer was sick but will be right down nonetheless."

# Instructions
In order to find evidence that helps your fact-check, you just ran a web search which yielded a Search Result. **Your task right now is to summarize the Search Result.** What to include:
* information that might be useful for the fact-check (see Record)
* relevant images (refer to images by inserting their reference <image:k>)
* if available: the release date as well as the author or the publisher (e.g. the media company) of the search result.

Do NOT include:
* advertisements
* any other information not related to the Record or the Claim

Additional rules:
* Do not add any additional information besides the information in the Search Result.
* If the Search Result doesn't contain any relevant information for the fact-checking work, simply print one word in capital letters: "NONE".
* Keep your writing style like in the Examples 1, 2 and 3 provided to you.
* Try to filter out relevant information even if the search result is in a different language.

# Example 1
The search result from America Today provides several photographs of the Notre-Dame Cathedral fire on April 15, 2019. <image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>. None of the images show the Eiffel Tower in the background. 

# Example 2
NONE

# Example 3
The Guardian discusses a report blaming the Syrian government for a toxic gas attack and condemning their use of chemical weapons. The Guardian mentions the Chemical Weapons Convention and the responsibilities of Syria under the convention. According to The Guardian, The White House condemned the Assad regime for defying the norm against chemical weapons use.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:65> This is an authentic image of an elderly Palestinian women being attacked by an Israeli army dog in June 2024."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:65>)
web_search("Israeli army dog attack Palestinian woman")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:65>

### Evidence from `web_search`
One source, from Al-Haq ([https://www.alhaq.org/monitoring-documentation/6941.html](https://www.alhaq.org/monitoring-documentation/6941.html)), describes an incident from December 2011 where an Israeli soldier unleashed a dog on a Palestinian woman. The article includes a photo of a dog attacking a woman.

Another source, from Middle East Eye ([https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israeli-army-dog-mauled-palestinian-pregnant-woman-then-she-lost-baby](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israeli-army-dog-mauled-palestinian-pregnant-woman-then-she-lost-baby)), published on January 6, 2025, discusses an attack by an Israeli combat dog on a pregnant Palestinian woman in late October 2023. The image <image:65>

## Elaboration
The provided evidence does not confirm the authenticity of the image. The reverse image search did not yield any results. The web search revealed two incidents involving Israeli army dogs attacking Palestinian women, but neither of them matches the image in the claim. One incident occurred in December 2011, and the other in late October 2023. The claim states the image is from June 2024.

Based on the evidence, there is no information to verify the claim that the image is authentic.

### Evidence from `web_search`
One source, from Al-Haq ([https://www.alhaq.org/monitoring-documentation/6941.html](https://www.alhaq.org/monitoring-documentation/6941.html)), describes an incident from December 2011 where an Israeli soldier unleashed a dog on a Palestinian woman. The article includes a photo of a dog attacking a woman.

Another source, from Middle East Eye ([https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israeli-army-dog-mauled-palestinian-pregnant-woman-then-she-lost-baby](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israeli-army-dog-mauled-palestinian-pregnant-woman-then-she-lost-baby)), published on January 6, 2025, discusses an attack by an Israeli combat dog on a pregnant Palestinian woman in late October 2023.

## Elaboration
The provided evidence does not confirm the authenticity of the image. The reverse image search did not yield any results.

One incident occurred in December 2011, and the other in late October 2023. The claim states the image is from June 2024.

Based on the evidence, there is no information to verify the claim that the image is authentic.
