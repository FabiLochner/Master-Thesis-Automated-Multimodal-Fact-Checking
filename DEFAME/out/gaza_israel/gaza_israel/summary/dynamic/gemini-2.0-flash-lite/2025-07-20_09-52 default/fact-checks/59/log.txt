Useful result: From [Source](https://defencesecurityasia.com/en/500-israeli-armored-vehicles-damaged-by-palestinian-fighters-reports-israeli-media/): Found exact image on website with title: 500 Israeli Armored Vehicles Damaged by Palestinian Fighters ...
Content: The search result from Defence Security Asia, published on June 30, 2024, reports that an Israeli newspaper Maariv estimated that more than 500 Israeli military armored vehicles have been damaged by Palestinian fighters since the conflict in the Gaza Strip began in October last year.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.defensemirror.com/news/35373/Hamas_Destroying_Israeli_Tanks_with_Improvised_Missile): Found exact image on website with title: Hamas Destroying Israeli Tanks with Improvised Missile
Content: The search result from Defensemirror.com, published on November 8, 2023, features the image <image:34> and discusses Hamas's use of the Yasin 105 missile to destroy Israeli tanks in the Gaza Strip. The article states that the Izz el-Deen al-Qassam Brigades developed the Yasin 105, inspired by the Russian "Tandem 85" rocket, and that it was first used in the "Al-Aqsa Flood" battle on October 7. The article also mentions that the Al-Qassam Brigades claimed to have destroyed 15 Israeli tanks and military vehicles using anti-armor shells in Beit Hanoun. The image is credited to IRNA.

The claim '<image:34> This image shows an Israeli tank unit near Jabalia camp in northern Gaza that was successfully ambushed by Hamas fighters, destroying multiple vehicles and injuring or killing their crews in October 2024.' is misleading.
Justification: The image in the claim was published in November 2023, as reported by [Defensemirror.com](https://www.defensemirror.com/2023/11/08/hamas-destroys-israeli-tanks-with-yasin-105-missile/), contradicting the claim's October 2024 date. The evidence also doesn't support the claim's details about the location and ambush.

So, the overall veracity is: misleading
