## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image ![image 11](media/13.jpg) is from an article about a fire and explosion at the Linde North America plant in Alpha, New Jersey, as reported by The Express-Times. The fire occurred in an outdoor area used to store chemical and gas containers.

The same image ![image 11](media/13.jpg) also appears in an article from the Webangah News Agency, published on July 2, 2025, about a massive explosion in Northern California. The article mentions a fire at a fireworks warehouse in Yolo County.


### Evidence from `web_search`
Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/rocket-attack-targets-military-base-hosting-us-forces-baghdad-military-sources-2024-09-30/](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/rocket-attack-targets-military-base-hosting-us-forces-baghdad-military-sources-2024-09-30/)) reports on a rocket attack near Baghdad International Airport on September 30, 2024, targeting a military base hosting U.S. forces. ReliefWeb ([https://reliefweb.int/report/iraq/ishm-september-26-october-3-2024](https://reliefweb.int/report/iraq/ishm-september-26-october-3-2024)) discusses attacks on September 30, including attacks by the "Islamic Resistance in Iraq" on Israeli targets.

The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_2024_Israeli_attacks_against_Lebanon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_2024_Israeli_attacks_against_Lebanon)) discusses the September 2024 Israeli attacks against Lebanon, which were part of the ongoing Israelâ€“Hezbollah conflict. On September 30, 2024, Hezbollah fired rockets into northern Israel and the Golan Heights. ![image 11](media/13.jpg)


## Elaboration
The image ![image 11](media/13.jpg)

## Final Judgement
The image is not related to the event described in the claim. The image is from a fire at a chemical plant in New Jersey and a fireworks warehouse in California. While there were attacks on September 30, 2024, including a rocket attack near Baghdad International Airport, the image does not depict this event.

`misleading`

### Verdict: MISLEADING

### Justification
The image in the claim is not related to the alleged attack in Baghdad on September 30, 2024. Reverse image searches show the image depicts a fire at a chemical plant in New Jersey and a fireworks warehouse in California. While there were attacks on September 30, 2024, including a rocket attack near Baghdad International Airport ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/rocket-attack-targets-military-base-hosting-us-forces-baghdad-military-sources-2024-09-30/)), the image does not depict this event.
