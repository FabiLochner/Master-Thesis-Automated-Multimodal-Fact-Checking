## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Pete Hegseth did call Putin a "war criminal." Newsweek published a fact check confirming this, and POLITICO reported that Roger Wicker stated Hegseth made this statement. The Kyiv Independent also reported on Hegseth's statements regarding the war.

However, the claim states that Hegseth is the "US Secretary of Defense." The evidence does not support this.


## Final Judgement
The claim is partially accurate. Pete Hegseth did call Putin a "war criminal," as confirmed by multiple sources. However, the claim incorrectly identifies Hegseth as the "US Secretary of Defense."

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
Pete Hegseth did call Putin a "war criminal," as reported by sources like [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/pete-hegseth-vladimir-putin-war-criminal-1985251) and POLITICO. However, the claim is inaccurate because it misidentifies Hegseth as the US Secretary of Defense.
