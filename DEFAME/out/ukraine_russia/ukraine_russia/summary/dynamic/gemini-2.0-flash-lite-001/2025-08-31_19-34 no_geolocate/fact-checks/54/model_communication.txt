Ukrainian lawmakers protest with placards before a vote replacing a law that attempted to curb the powers of anticorruption bodies, in Kyiv, on July 31, 2025 \[Andrii Nesterenko/AFP\]

Published On 2 Aug 20252 Aug 2025

Ukrainian authorities have detained several officials over a “large-scale corruption scheme” in the defence sector, just days after lawmakers restored the independence of the country’s two main investigative bodies.

The National Anti-Corruption Agency (NABU) and the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office (SAP) said in a joint statement on Saturday that they made four arrests in connection with the scheme, which involved the procurement of military drones and signal jamming systems.

“The essence of the scheme was to conclude state contracts with supplier companies at deliberately inflated prices,” they said, adding that the suspects had received kickbacks of up to 30 percent of the contract amounts.

NABU and SAPO said they had caught a sitting lawmaker, two local officials and an unspecified number of National Guard personnel taking bribes. The suspects were not identified in Saturday’s statement.

The Ministry of Internal Affairs also said it had suspended the suspected National Guard members.

The announcement comes after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy came under criticism last month for [trying to take away](/news/2025/7/29/why-zelenskyy-tried-to-curb-autonomy-of-ukraines-anticorruption-agencies)
 the anticorruption agencies’ independence and place them under the control of his prosecutor-general.

The agencies regained their autonomy after Zelenskyy’s move sparked the first antigovernment demonstrations in Ukraine since Russia invaded in 2022.

Zelenskyy, who enjoys far-reaching wartime powers, initially said he needed to bring the agencies under his control because they were inefficient and under “Russian influence”.

But he then said he had heard people’s anger and [submitted a bill](/news/2025/7/24/ukraines-zelenskyy-introduces-new-draft-law-after-anticorruption-protests)
 restoring the agencies’ independence, which was [passed by lawmakers](/news/2025/7/31/ukraine-parliament-votes-to-restore-anti-corruption-agencies-after-protests)
 on Thursday.

“It is important that anticorruption institutions operate independently, and the law passed on Thursday guarantees them all the tools necessary for a real fight against corruption,” Zelenskyy said.

Ukraine’s European allies praised the about-face, having voiced concerns about the original defanging of the agencies.

Top officials had told Zelenskyy that Ukraine was jeopardising its bid for European Union membership by curbing the powers of its antigraft authorities.

In a statement about Saturday’s arrests, Zelenskyy said he was “grateful to the anti-corruption agencies for their work”.

Ukraine’s anti-corruption agencies exposed a corruption scheme involving procurement of military equipment just two days after the parliament reinstated their independence following mass protests and pressure from Brussels.

The National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) and Special Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office (SABO) discovered a “large-scale corruption scheme” that exploited budget funds allocated for defense forces, the agencies said [in a statement](https://t.me/nab_ukraine/3312)
 on Saturday.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the scheme "absolutely immoral,” in a [Telegram post](https://t.me/s/V_Zelenskiy_official)
. None of them were named in the statement.

The corruption involved purchasing equipment [at knowingly inflated prices](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/ukraine-says-it-uncovers-major-drone-procurement-corruption-scheme-2025-08-02/)
 for which the participants illegally received 30 percent of the contract amount, according to the agencies. A similar approach was used in FPV drone procurement, the agencies said.

The revelation by the [anti-corruption agencies](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/08/02/europe/ukraine-corruption-drone-scheme-latam-intl)
 comes after the Ukrainian leadership attempted to subject the oversight of the bodies to the politically appointed prosecutor general of Ukraine. Those involved "were exposed for taking bribes," he said.

The NABU and the SABO said [the scheme included](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20250802-ukraine-anti-corruption-agencies-uncover-major-drone-procurement-graft-scheme)
 a serving member of parliament, regional officials, the head of a unit of the National Guard’s military unit and a director of a company supplying drones. Zelenskyy signed a bill into law on Thursday that [restored independence](https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-protests-volodymyr-zelenskyy-kyiv-power-politics-corruption/)
 to the agencies.

“There can only be zero tolerance for corruption, clear teamwork to expose corruption, and ultimately a fair sentence," Zelenskyy [wrote](https://t.me/V_Zelenskiy_official/15416)
 on Telegram on Saturday. "It is important that anti-corruption institutions work independently, and [the law adopted on Thursday](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gq3xwr357o)
 guarantees them all the opportunities for a real fight against corruption,” he said.

He called for [full and fair accountability](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2025/08/02/ukraine-uncovers-drone-procurement-corruption-scheme/)
. 

“We are counting on fair verdicts,” Zelenskyy said in an [official statement](https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/rosiya-zatyaguye-vijnu-otzhe-bude-otrimuvati-spravedlivi-vid-99281)
 late Saturday. He said only combat officers will hold leadership positions in all logistics units of the National Guard. 

Zelenskyy reinstated the independence of the NABU and the SAPO after domestic protests and a [warning](https://www.politico.eu/article/ursula-von-der-leyen-volodymyr-zelenskyy-europe-ukraine-anti-corruption-watchdog-independence/)
 from European Commission that Ukraine's EU bid was put at risk."

By [Hanna Duggal](/author/duggalhaljazeera-net)

Published On 21 Aug 202521 Aug 2025

After a week of high-stakes diplomacy aimed at halting the war in Ukraine, United States President Donald Trump says he is set on arranging a summit between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Following separate meetings with both leaders, Trump has ruled out sending US troops to Ukraine, but pledged security guarantees to Kyiv and indicated that Washington could provide air support to reinforce a potential deal.

Ukraine, in turn, told reporters at the White House it would obtain US-made weapons purchased by Europeans for an estimated $90bn as part of the effort to bolster its defences.

Which countries are aiding Ukraine?
-----------------------------------

At least 41 countries have contributed to Ukraine’s war efforts monetarily, either through military, humanitarian or financial assistance, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German think tank.

Military assistance includes weapons, equipment and financial aid for the Ukrainian military. These include Australia, Austria, Cyprus, the Republic of Ireland, Japan, Malta, New Zealand, South Korea, Switzerland, China, Taiwan, and India.

The European Union, through the Commission and Council, has also delivered substantial aid to Ukraine.

![INTERACTIVE - Which countries are aiding Ukraine?-1755767959](/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/INTERACTIVE-Which-countries-are-aiding-Ukraine-1755767959.png?quality=80)

How much aid has Ukraine received so far?
-----------------------------------------

So far, Ukraine has received more than 309 billion euros ($360bn) in military, financial, and humanitarian aid, according to the Kiel Institute:

*   **Military aid** – 149.26 billion euros ($174bn – using today’s exchange rate of €1 = $1.17)
*   **Financial aid** – 139.34 billion euros ($163bn)
*   **Humanitarian aid** – 21.04 billion euros ($24bn)

Who are Ukraine’s largest donors?
---------------------------------

The US has committed the largest amount of aid to Ukraine, providing 114.64 billion euros ($134bn) between January 24, 2022 and June 30, 2025, of which:

*   **Military aid** – 64.6 billion euros ($75bn)
*   **Financial aid** – 46.6 billion euros ($54bn)
*   **Humanitarian aid** – 3.4 billion euros ($4bn)

The EU (Commission and Council) is the second biggest donor at 63.19 billion euros ($74bn), followed by Germany (21.29 billion euros or $25bn), the UK (18.6 billion euros or $21bn) and Japan (13.57 billion euros or $15bn).

How much aid has been pledged v allocated?
------------------------------------------

According to the Kiel Institute, European countries have collectively allocated 167.4 billion euros ($195bn) to the war in Ukraine, more than the 114.6 billion euros ($134bn) allocated by the US.

Allocated aid refers to funds or resources that have actually been set aside, delivered, or officially committed for use by Ukraine.

It is different from pledged aid, which is money or equipment promised by a country but not yet delivered or officially set aside.

In total, Europe as a whole has committed 257.4 billion euros ($300bn) and the US 119 billion euros ($139bn).

US aid to Ukraine plummets under Trump
--------------------------------------

Days before Trump took office, the Biden administration gave one final injection of military support to Ukraine with a weapons package of $500m on January 9.

Following the start of the Trump administration’s second term in office, aid to Ukraine has plummeted, with Washington suspending all support, including weapons, in March after a tense meeting with Zelenskyy at the White House.

Trump made claims that the US has given Ukraine more than $300bn in wartime aid. That number has been contested by Ukraine and its supporters, despite the US being the single largest donor country.

What weapons has Ukraine received?
----------------------------------

Ukraine has received various weapons systems from its allies, including armoured vehicles, artillery, aircraft, air defence systems, drones, missiles, and a wide range of support equipment.

According to the Kiel Institute, Poland has supplied its neighbour with the largest number of tanks, totaling 354, while the US leads in providing infantry fighting vehicles (305), howitzers (201), air defence systems (18), and HIMARS rocket launchers (41).

The HIMARS, capable of striking targets just a few metres (feet) wide from nearly 80km (50 miles) away, gave Ukraine a vital long-range precision strike capability that slowed Russian advances early in the war.

NATO defence spending
---------------------

In a news briefing, the White House said the US could help coordinate a security guarantee for Ukraine. Humanitarian relief covers medical, food and other items for civilians, while financial assistance comes in the form of grants, loans and guarantees.

Most contributions to Ukraine have come from NATO, with 29 of its 32 members providing monetary aid, according to the Kiel Institute.

Additionally, 12 non-NATO countries and territories have sent monetary aid to Ukraine. However, Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has ruled out the deployment of troops from NATO countries to help secure a peace deal.

In June, NATO leaders signed a deal to increase defence spending, which is to be achieved over the next 10 years, and is a jump worth hundreds of billions of dollars a year from the current goal of 2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) to 5 percent.

Currently, 23 of the 32 member countries have met this target, with the alliance as a whole spending 2.61 percent of its combined GDP on defence last year.

NATO countries bordering Russia, such as Estonia and Lithuania, have significantly increased their defence spending – from less than 1 percent of their GDP just 10 years ago.

A main aim of this database to quantify the scale of aid to Ukraine and to make the support measures comparable across donor countries. Much of the discussion on aid to Ukraine since the beginning of the war has been anecdotal, while a rigorous quantification has been missing. To value these, we draw on a broad range of sources to identify market prices, choosing an upper bound, when possible, e.g., by using the new purchase price even if much of the military equipment is probably used.

The Ukraine Support Tracker lists and quantifies military, financial, and humanitarian aid pledged to Ukraine since January 24, 2022. *   [Go to main content.](#main "Go to main content.")

A Database of Military, Financial and Humanitarian Aid to Ukraine
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The Ukraine Support Tracker lists and quantifies military, financial and humanitarian support by governments to Ukraine since February 2022. The database is intended to support a facts-based discussion about support to Ukraine. 

We focus on government-to-government transfers into Ukraine. This means that Europe now also leads the US in terms of total volume of military aid provided through industry since the start of the war. To do so, we set up a comprehensive database that brings together information from official, government sources, existing lists of Ukraine aid, and reports by renowned news media.

An important challenge is to **quantify non-financial transfers**, such as in-kind shipments of military equipment, weapons, medicines or foodstuff. We have also not (yet) systematically collected support by international organizations like the Red Cross or the United Nations, mainly because a lack of systematic data and reporting by most such international organizations.

The Ukraine Support Tracker is constantly being expanded, corrected and improved. Suggestions are very welcome and can be sent to [ukrainetracker@ifw-kiel.de](#)

Ukraine the world’s biggest arms importer; United States’ dominance of global arms exports grows as Russian exports continue to fall
====================================================================================================================================

10 March 2025

![Photo: US Air Force/Staff Sgt. European arms imports overall grew by 155 per cent between the same periods, as states responded to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and uncertainty over the future of US foreign policy. The top 10 arms exporters in 2020–24 were the same as those in 2015–19 but **Russia** (accounting for 7.8 per cent of global arms exports) fell to third place behind **France** (9.6 per cent), while **Italy** (4.8 per cent) jumped from 10th to sixth place. 

At least 35 states sent weapons to **Ukraine** after Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022, and substantial further deliveries are in the pipeline. Most of the major arms supplied to Ukraine came from the USA (45 per cent), followed by Germany (12 per cent) and Poland (11 per cent). Ukraine was the only European state among the top 10 importers in 2020–24, although many other European states significantly increased their arms imports in the period.

‘The new arms transfers figures clearly reflect the rearmament taking place among states in Europe in response to the threat from Russia,’ said Mathew George, Programme Director with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme. The decline started before Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022: in 2020 and 2021 export volumes were much smaller than in any year in the previous two decades. 

‘The war against Ukraine has further accelerated the drop in Russia’s arms exports because more weapons are needed on the battlefield, trade sanctions make it harder for Russia to produce and sell its weapons, and the USA and its allies pressure states not to buy Russian arms,’ said Pieter Wezeman. This was mainly due to deliveries of combat aircraft to Greece and Croatia, and arms supplies to Ukraine after Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022. 

Nevertheless, India received by far the largest share of French arms exports (28 per cent)—almost twice the share that went to all European recipients combined (15 per cent). The main suppliers to South America in 2020–24 were France (accounting for 30 per cent of South American arms imports), the USA (12 per cent) and the UK (11 per cent).
    
*   **North Korea** exported artillery and missiles to Russia for use in Ukraine. Alexander Cook

**(Stockholm, 10 March 2025) Ukraine became the world’s largest importer of major arms in the period 2020–24, with its imports increasing nearly 100 times over compared with 2015–19. The United States further increased its share of global arms exports to 43 per cent, while Russia’s exports fell by 64 per cent, according to new data on international arms transfers published today by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), available at** [**www.sipri.org**](https://www.sipri.org/)

The overall volume of arms transfers globally remained at roughly the same level as in 2015–19 and 2010–14 (but was 18 per cent higher than in 2005–2009), as increasing imports in Europe and the Americas were offset by decreases in other regions."

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States"

## Actions

web_search("Ukraine US arms sales corruption")

```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/2/ukraine-says-defence-sector-corruption-scheme-uncovered](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/2/ukraine-says-defence-sector-corruption-scheme-uncovered)) reported that Ukrainian authorities detained officials over a large-scale corruption scheme in the defense sector involving inflated prices and kickbacks. Politico ([https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-uncovers-major-corruption-scheme-defense-procurment-days-after-restoring-anticorruption/](https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-uncovers-major-corruption-scheme-defense-procurment-days-after-restoring-anticorruption/)) also reported on a corruption scheme involving the procurement of military equipment at inflated prices.

PBS Frontline World ([https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/sierraleone/context.html](https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/sierraleone/context.html)) discusses illicit weapons, high-level corruption, and organized crime centered in Ukraine, highlighting the loss of military assets due to theft and lack of oversight. <image:k>


### Evidence from `web_search`
Al Jazeera published an article on August 21, 2025, discussing US aid to Ukraine, which totaled 114.64 billion euros ($134bn) between January 24, 2022, and June 30, 2025, including military, financial, and humanitarian aid (<image:1>, <image:2>). The article also mentions that Ukraine has received various weapons systems from its allies. The forumarmstrade.org provides a timeline of military aid to Ukraine from 2021 to 2025, detailing aid packages from various countries, including the United States, with artillery shells, ammunition, air defense systems, drones, and other equipment.

The Kiel Institute for the World Economy provides a "Ukraine Support Tracker" database quantifying military, financial, and humanitarian aid pledged to Ukraine since January 24, 2022, with the latest update from August 12, 2025, covering data up to June 2025 (<image:k>). The tracker includes information from official government sources and news media reports. The database also mentions that Europe is now leading the US in terms of total volume of military aid provided.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Ukraine has received substantial military aid from the United States and other allies. There are reports of corruption within the Ukrainian defense sector, including inflated prices and kickbacks, as well as the loss of military assets due to theft and lack of oversight. However, the evidence does not provide any information about the percentage of armaments being sold.

To verify the claim, information is missing regarding the volume of arms sales by Ukraine and the origin of those arms.


## Actions

web_search("Ukraine arms trafficking investigation")

Future trends in arms trafficking from the Ukraine conflict

*   [](https://globalinitiative.net/crime_type/arms-trafficking/)
    
*   [](https://globalinitiative.net/crime_type/violence-fragility/)
    

*   [! What this means for organized crime, and specifically the smuggling of weapons and ammunition into Europe is unclear, but by using scenario modelling we can divine insights and provide concrete recommendations.

On 20–21 January 2025, the GI-TOC hosted a conference in Brussels to discuss three potential trajectories of the Russo-Ukrainian conflict and the ramifications of each on arms trafficking dynamics in Europe.

The conference gamed three scenarios – a peace agreement, a stalemate conflict and a decisive victory for Ukraine or Russia. Some leakage must be expected, and understanding this reality should persuade policymakers to act sooner rather than wait for a trigger event in a European city.

#### Key points

*   Draft, support and implement policy measures that reduce arms trafficking risks in Ukraine, including (when it is formulated) Ukraine’s demobilization law, and its security sector reform and veteran policy.
*   Improve Europe-wide operational capabilities in terms of information sharing, coordination and access to data.
*   The arms trafficking trade is likely to be multifaceted: a small-scale trade to European organized crime, and a larger volume trade to other regions (Africa, Latin America, Middle East, Central Asia), potentially to conflict actors.
*   ‘Traditional’ organized crime may be involved in arms trafficking alongside other more lucrative activities, like the drug trade, but ex-military personnel may form a new class of ‘brokers’, using connections with other military and politicians to set up larger-scale operations.
*   Tailor responses that recognize demand is king: the right kit for the right customer. <image:1112>\

Smoke on the horizon: Trends in arms trafficking from the conflict in Ukraine\
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://globalinitiative.net/analysis/trends-arms-trafficking-conflict-ukraine-russia-monitor/)

[! Participants were asked to respond, from the perspective of organized crime, law enforcement and multilateral policymakers, to emergent arms trafficking dynamics, working through various turns to discover second- and third-order implications. Asking participants to step outside their role and think like a criminal is rewarding and illuminates the discussion, while building trust and personal connections.

The purpose of this exercise was to provide policymakers with a forward-looking perspective that would map the potential risk of arms trafficking across a range of situations, point up gaps in responses and develop specific and measurable policy response options for national authorities to implement with the aim of reducing the risks of illicit firearms markets in Europe from the conflict.

Fostering international cooperation and information-sharing was also a primary goal of the conference. More than 60 high-level stakeholders attended from a range of organizations focusing on arms trafficking.

#### Understanding the risk

Understanding of the risks of arms trafficking arising from the conflict has improved since the Russian invasion in February 2022. Yet recent research suggests criminal groups are establishing more organized arms trafficking markets, routes and supply chains, and the scale of the problem is much larger than past occurrences of large-scale diversion, such as the Balkans and Afghanistan. Experts and policymakers in neighbouring and other European countries continue to express their concerns about the threat of large-scale diversion of small arms and light weapons (SALW) and ammunition from Ukraine. An overarching conclusion was that policy responses must flexible and scalable from the start.

**Use lessons learned (and learn new ones)**

The conference highlighted the fact that many policy bodies in Europe have a deep and multilayered understanding of the legacy of the Balkans conflict on arms trafficking trends in Europe."

The Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime published a report on June 18, 2024, discussing future trends in arms trafficking from the Ukraine conflict. The report highlights concerns about the diversion of small arms and light weapons (SALW) and ammunition from Ukraine, and the establishment of more organized arms trafficking markets, routes, and supply chains.

! Taking into account the EU recommendations and ensuring the proper functioning of the Coordination Centre, we are making our contribution to the development of the European security architecture,” the Minister added.

In his turn, Ambassador Petr Mareš, Special Representative of the OSCE Chairmanship and Project Co-ordinator in Ukraine, said that the issue of arms trafficking is becoming increasingly acute due to russia’s full-scale invasion, but the creation of the Coordination Centre will help to effectively counteract this problem. Achieving synergy in combating illicit arms trafficking is of great importance to us, as we are aware that the war is ongoing, and only through joint efforts can we ensure security in Ukraine and Europe,” he said.

In response, the Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine stressed that, with the assistance of international partners, the Ministry of Internal Affairs is implementing a number of joint projects aimed at building the institutional capacity of law enforcement agencies.

Harshet Virk, the Head of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime Programme Office in Ukraine, stressed that owing to the coordinated and efficient efforts of Ukrainian law enforcement agencies, not a single weapon was trafficked to the European Union: “I sincerely congratulate you on the establishment of the Coordination Centre – this is an important step in the fight against crime and illicit arms trafficking. <image:1118>

Harshet Virk noted that her team will continue to support the initiatives of the Ministry of Internal Affairs by providing software and organising relevant trainings.

Maura O’Sullivan, the Acting Head of the EU Advisory Mission Ukraine, said that the Centre is a reliable solution for monitoring the situation in Ukraine, particularly in the area of combating illicit arms trafficking: “We are ready to continue to support you and facilitate the rapid exchange of information. The main tasks of the Centre are:

– processing and systematisation of information received;

– coordinating the actions of state authorities, institutions and organisations on combating illicit firearms trafficking;

– ensuring the exchange of information between the authorities of Ukraine and partner countries;

– obtaining complete information about weapons;

– improving the legal framework for combating illicit firearms trafficking;

– identifying ways and means of solving problematic issues.

Al Jazeera published an article on August 21, 2025, discussing US aid to Ukraine, which totaled 114.64 billion euros ($134bn) between January 24, 2022, and June 30, 2025, including military, financial, and humanitarian aid (<image:1>, <image:2>). The article also mentions that Ukraine has received various weapons systems from its allies. The forumarmstrade.org provides a timeline of military aid to Ukraine from 2021 to 2025, detailing aid packages from various countries, including the United States, with artillery shells, ammunition, air defense systems, drones, and other equipment.

The Kiel Institute for the World Economy provides a "Ukraine Support Tracker" database quantifying military, financial, and humanitarian aid pledged to Ukraine since January 24, 2022, with the latest update from August 12, 2025, covering data up to June 2025 (<image:k>). The tracker includes information from official government sources and news media reports. The database also mentions that Europe is now leading the US in terms of total volume of military aid provided.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Ukraine has received substantial military aid from the United States and other allies. There are reports of corruption within the Ukrainian defense sector, including inflated prices and kickbacks, as well as the loss of military assets due to theft and lack of oversight. However, the evidence does not provide any information about the percentage of armaments being sold.

To verify the claim, information is missing regarding the volume of arms sales by Ukraine and the origin of those arms.

From [Source](https://globalinitiative.net/analysis/future-trends-in-arms-trafficking-from-the-ukraine-conflict/): 
Content: The Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime published a report on June 18, 2024, discussing future trends in arms trafficking from the Ukraine conflict. The report highlights concerns about the diversion of small arms and light weapons (SALW) and ammunition from Ukraine, and the establishment of more organized arms trafficking markets, routes, and supply chains. The report suggests that arms trafficking is likely to be multifaceted, involving small-scale trade to European organized crime, and a larger volume trade to other regions (Africa, Latin America, Middle East, Central Asia), potentially to conflict actors. <image:1112>

The main suppliers to Ukraine were the USA (45%), Germany (12%), and Poland (11%) ([https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2025/ukraine-worlds-biggest-arms-importer-united-states-dominance-global-arms-exports-grows-russian](https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2025/ukraine-worlds-biggest-arms-importer-united-states-dominance-global-arms-exports-grows-russian)). The Associated Press reported on an $825 million arms sale to Ukraine approved by the Trump administration ([https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-us-weapons-sale-trump-russia-74e01123c0067d5fc160141e0cabf207](https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-us-weapons-sale-trump-russia-74e01123c0067d5fc160141e0cabf207)). The Washington Post discussed the dominance of the global arms industry, with U.S. arms exports increasing by more than a fifth between 2020 and 2024 ([https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/03/09/us-arms-sales-ukraine-israel/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/03/09/us-arms-sales-ukraine-israel/)). None of the sources mention the percentage of arms sales by Ukraine. <image:k>


### Evidence from `web_search`
The Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime published a report on June 18, 2024, discussing future trends in arms trafficking from the Ukraine conflict, highlighting concerns about the diversion of small arms and light weapons (SALW) and ammunition from Ukraine, and the establishment of more organized arms trafficking markets, routes, and supply chains (<image:1112>). The EU Advisory Mission Ukraine (EUAM) reported on February 6, 2025, that the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine launched a Coordination Centre to Combat Illicit Arms Trafficking (<image:1115>, <image:1117>, <image:1118>, <image:1120>). The UN Office on Drugs and Crime stated that no weapons were trafficked to the European Union due to the efforts of Ukrainian law enforcement agencies.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Ukraine has become a major importer of arms, with the U.S. being a primary supplier. There are also concerns about arms trafficking and diversion of weapons from Ukraine. However, the evidence does not provide any data on the percentage of arms sales by Ukraine.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified due to a lack of information regarding the percentage of arms sales.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States"

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/2/ukraine-says-defence-sector-corruption-scheme-uncovered](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/2/ukraine-says-defence-sector-corruption-scheme-uncovered)) reported that Ukrainian authorities detained officials over a large-scale corruption scheme in the defense sector involving inflated prices and kickbacks. Politico ([https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-uncovers-major-corruption-scheme-defense-procurment-days-after-restoring-anticorruption/](https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-uncovers-major-corruption-scheme-defense-procurment-days-after-restoring-anticorruption/)) also reported on a corruption scheme involving the procurement of military equipment at inflated prices.

PBS Frontline World ([https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/sierraleone/context.html](https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/sierraleone/context.html)) discusses illicit weapons, high-level corruption, and organized crime centered in Ukraine, highlighting the loss of military assets due to theft and lack of oversight. <image:k>


### Evidence from `web_search`
Al Jazeera published an article on August 21, 2025, discussing US aid to Ukraine, which totaled 114.64 billion euros ($134bn) between January 24, 2022, and June 30, 2025, including military, financial, and humanitarian aid (<image:1>, <image:2>). The article also mentions that Ukraine has received various weapons systems from its allies. The forumarmstrade.org provides a timeline of military aid to Ukraine from 2021 to 2025, detailing aid packages from various countries, including the United States, with artillery shells, ammunition, air defense systems, drones, and other equipment.

The Kiel Institute for the World Economy provides a "Ukraine Support Tracker" database quantifying military, financial, and humanitarian aid pledged to Ukraine since January 24, 2022, with the latest update from August 12, 2025, covering data up to June 2025 (<image:k>). The tracker includes information from official government sources and news media reports. The database also mentions that Europe is now leading the US in terms of total volume of military aid provided.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Ukraine has received substantial military aid from the United States and other allies. There are reports of corruption within the Ukrainian defense sector, including inflated prices and kickbacks, as well as the loss of military assets due to theft and lack of oversight. However, the evidence does not provide any information about the percentage of armaments being sold.

To verify the claim, information is missing regarding the volume of arms sales by Ukraine and the origin of those arms.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) reported that Ukraine became the world's largest importer of major arms in 2020–24, with imports increasing nearly 100 times compared to 2015–19. The main suppliers to Ukraine were the USA (45%), Germany (12%), and Poland (11%) ([https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2025/ukraine-worlds-biggest-arms-importer-united-states-dominance-global-arms-exports-grows-russian](https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2025/ukraine-worlds-biggest-arms-importer-united-states-dominance-global-arms-exports-grows-russian)). The Associated Press reported on an $825 million arms sale to Ukraine approved by the Trump administration ([https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-us-weapons-sale-trump-russia-74e01123c0067d5fc160141e0cabf207](https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-us-weapons-sale-trump-russia-74e01123c0067d5fc160141e0cabf207)). The Washington Post discussed the dominance of the global arms industry, with U.S. arms exports increasing by more than a fifth between 2020 and 2024 ([https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/03/09/us-arms-sales-ukraine-israel/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/03/09/us-arms-sales-ukraine-israel/)). None of the sources mention the percentage of arms sales by Ukraine. <image:k>


### Evidence from `web_search`
The Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime published a report on June 18, 2024, discussing future trends in arms trafficking from the Ukraine conflict, highlighting concerns about the diversion of small arms and light weapons (SALW) and ammunition from Ukraine, and the establishment of more organized arms trafficking markets, routes, and supply chains (<image:1112>). The EU Advisory Mission Ukraine (EUAM) reported on February 6, 2025, that the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine launched a Coordination Centre to Combat Illicit Arms Trafficking (<image:1115>, <image:1117>, <image:1118>, <image:1120>). The UN Office on Drugs and Crime stated that no weapons were trafficked to the European Union due to the efforts of Ukrainian law enforcement agencies.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Ukraine has become a major importer of arms, with the U.S. being a primary supplier. There are also concerns about arms trafficking and diversion of weapons from Ukraine. However, the evidence does not provide any data on the percentage of arms sales by Ukraine.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified due to a lack of information regarding the percentage of arms sales.

Ukraine Weapons Sales

Weapons Sales are presented as a Trend-Indicator Value based on the known unit production costs of a core set of weapons such as aircraft, air defence systems, anti-submarine warfare weapons, armoured vehicles, artillery, engines, missiles, sensors, satellites, ships and others. The indicator aims to represent the transfer value of military resources rather than the financial value of the transfer.

|     | Actual | Previous | Highest | Lowest | Dates | Unit | Frequency |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|     | 23.00 | 29.00 | 1495.00 | 23.00 | 1992 - 2024 | SIPRI TIV Million | Yearly |     |

Claim: "Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States"

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/2/ukraine-says-defence-sector-corruption-scheme-uncovered](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/2/ukraine-says-defence-sector-corruption-scheme-uncovered)) reported that Ukrainian authorities detained officials over a large-scale corruption scheme in the defense sector involving inflated prices and kickbacks. Politico ([https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-uncovers-major-corruption-scheme-defense-procurment-days-after-restoring-anticorruption/](https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-uncovers-major-corruption-scheme-defense-procurment-days-after-restoring-anticorruption/)) also reported on a corruption scheme involving the procurement of military equipment at inflated prices.

PBS Frontline World ([https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/sierraleone/context.html](https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/sierraleone/context.html)) discusses illicit weapons, high-level corruption, and organized crime centered in Ukraine, highlighting the loss of military assets due to theft and lack of oversight. <image:k>


### Evidence from `web_search`
Al Jazeera published an article on August 21, 2025, discussing US aid to Ukraine, which totaled 114.64 billion euros ($134bn) between January 24, 2022, and June 30, 2025, including military, financial, and humanitarian aid (<image:1>, <image:2>). The article also mentions that Ukraine has received various weapons systems from its allies. The forumarmstrade.org provides a timeline of military aid to Ukraine from 2021 to 2025, detailing aid packages from various countries, including the United States, with artillery shells, ammunition, air defense systems, drones, and other equipment.

The Kiel Institute for the World Economy provides a "Ukraine Support Tracker" database quantifying military, financial, and humanitarian aid pledged to Ukraine since January 24, 2022, with the latest update from August 12, 2025, covering data up to June 2025 (<image:k>). The tracker includes information from official government sources and news media reports. The database also mentions that Europe is now leading the US in terms of total volume of military aid provided.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Ukraine has received substantial military aid from the United States and other allies. There are reports of corruption within the Ukrainian defense sector, including inflated prices and kickbacks, as well as the loss of military assets due to theft and lack of oversight. However, the evidence does not provide any information about the percentage of armaments being sold.

To verify the claim, information is missing regarding the volume of arms sales by Ukraine and the origin of those arms.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) reported that Ukraine became the world's largest importer of major arms in 2020–24, with imports increasing nearly 100 times compared to 2015–19. The main suppliers to Ukraine were the USA (45%), Germany (12%), and Poland (11%) ([https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2025/ukraine-worlds-biggest-arms-importer-united-states-dominance-global-arms-exports-grows-russian](https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2025/ukraine-worlds-biggest-arms-importer-united-states-dominance-global-arms-exports-grows-russian)). The Associated Press reported on an $825 million arms sale to Ukraine approved by the Trump administration ([https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-us-weapons-sale-trump-russia-74e01123c0067d5fc160141e0cabf207](https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-us-weapons-sale-trump-russia-74e01123c0067d5fc160141e0cabf207)). The Washington Post discussed the dominance of the global arms industry, with U.S. arms exports increasing by more than a fifth between 2020 and 2024 ([https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/03/09/us-arms-sales-ukraine-israel/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/03/09/us-arms-sales-ukraine-israel/)). None of the sources mention the percentage of arms sales by Ukraine. <image:k>


### Evidence from `web_search`
The Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime published a report on June 18, 2024, discussing future trends in arms trafficking from the Ukraine conflict, highlighting concerns about the diversion of small arms and light weapons (SALW) and ammunition from Ukraine, and the establishment of more organized arms trafficking markets, routes, and supply chains (<image:1112>). The EU Advisory Mission Ukraine (EUAM) reported on February 6, 2025, that the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine launched a Coordination Centre to Combat Illicit Arms Trafficking (<image:1115>, <image:1117>, <image:1118>, <image:1120>). The UN Office on Drugs and Crime stated that no weapons were trafficked to the European Union due to the efforts of Ukrainian law enforcement agencies.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Ukraine has become a major importer of arms, with the U.S. being a primary supplier. There are also concerns about arms trafficking and diversion of weapons from Ukraine. However, the evidence does not provide any data on the percentage of arms sales by Ukraine.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified due to a lack of information regarding the percentage of arms sales.

The investigation revealed that while Ukraine receives significant military aid and has faced corruption issues, there is no evidence to support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. The search results provided information on arms imports and exports, but not the specific percentage of arms sales.

Politico ([https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-uncovers-major-corruption-scheme-defense-procurment-days-after-restoring-anticorruption/](https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-uncovers-major-corruption-scheme-defense-procurment-days-after-restoring-anticorruption/)) also reported on a corruption scheme involving the procurement of military equipment at inflated prices.

PBS Frontline World ([https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/sierraleone/context.html](https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/sierraleone/context.html)) discusses illicit weapons, high-level corruption, and organized crime centered in Ukraine, highlighting the loss of military assets due to theft and lack of oversight. <image:k>


### Evidence from `web_search`
Al Jazeera published an article on August 21, 2025, discussing US aid to Ukraine, which totaled 114.64 billion euros ($134bn) between January 24, 2022, and June 30, 2025, including military, financial, and humanitarian aid (<image:1>, <image:2>). The article also mentions that Ukraine has received various weapons systems from its allies. The forumarmstrade.org provides a timeline of military aid to Ukraine from 2021 to 2025, detailing aid packages from various countries, including the United States, with artillery shells, ammunition, air defense systems, drones, and other equipment.

The Kiel Institute for the World Economy provides a "Ukraine Support Tracker" database quantifying military, financial, and humanitarian aid pledged to Ukraine since January 24, 2022, with the latest update from August 12, 2025, covering data up to June 2025 (<image:k>). The tracker includes information from official government sources and news media reports. The database also mentions that Europe is now leading the US in terms of total volume of military aid provided.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Ukraine has received substantial military aid from the United States and other allies. There are reports of corruption within the Ukrainian defense sector, including inflated prices and kickbacks, as well as the loss of military assets due to theft and lack of oversight. However, the evidence does not provide any information about the percentage of armaments being sold.

To verify the claim, information is missing regarding the volume of arms sales by Ukraine and the origin of those arms.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) reported that Ukraine became the world's largest importer of major arms in 2020–24, with imports increasing nearly 100 times compared to 2015–19. The main suppliers to Ukraine were the USA (45%), Germany (12%), and Poland (11%) ([https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2025/ukraine-worlds-biggest-arms-importer-united-states-dominance-global-arms-exports-grows-russian](https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2025/ukraine-worlds-biggest-arms-importer-united-states-dominance-global-arms-exports-grows-russian)). The Associated Press reported on an $825 million arms sale to Ukraine approved by the Trump administration ([https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-us-weapons-sale-trump-russia-74e01123c0067d5fc160141e0cabf207](https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-us-weapons-sale-trump-russia-74e01123c0067d5fc160141e0cabf207)). The Washington Post discussed the dominance of the global arms industry, with U.S. arms exports increasing by more than a fifth between 2020 and 2024 ([https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/03/09/us-arms-sales-ukraine-israel/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/03/09/us-arms-sales-ukraine-israel/)). None of the sources mention the percentage of arms sales by Ukraine. <image:k>


### Evidence from `web_search`
The Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime published a report on June 18, 2024, discussing future trends in arms trafficking from the Ukraine conflict, highlighting concerns about the diversion of small arms and light weapons (SALW) and ammunition from Ukraine, and the establishment of more organized arms trafficking markets, routes, and supply chains (<image:1112>). The EU Advisory Mission Ukraine (EUAM) reported on February 6, 2025, that the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine launched a Coordination Centre to Combat Illicit Arms Trafficking (<image:1115>, <image:1117>, <image:1118>, <image:1120>). The UN Office on Drugs and Crime stated that no weapons were trafficked to the European Union due to the efforts of Ukrainian law enforcement agencies.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Ukraine has become a major importer of arms, with the U.S. being a primary supplier. There are also concerns about arms trafficking and diversion of weapons from Ukraine. However, the evidence does not provide any data on the percentage of arms sales by Ukraine.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified due to a lack of information regarding the percentage of arms sales.


## Actions
```
web_search("Ukraine arms sales statistics")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Statista, in cooperation with SIPRI, published a report in March 2025, detailing arms exports from Ukraine by country from 2018 to 2024, with China, Saudi Arabia, and India as main importers. ([https://www.statista.com/statistics/1294319/ukraine-arms-exports-by-country/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1294319/ukraine-arms-exports-by-country/)) <image:13121> <image:13122> <image:13123> Trading Economics reports that Ukraine's weapons sales decreased to 23 SIPRI TIV Million in 2024, with an average of 388.15 SIPRI TIV Million from 1992 to 2024. ([https://tradingeconomics.com/ukraine/weapons-sales](https://tradingeconomics.com/ukraine/weapons-sales))

The report does not mention the percentage of arms sales by Ukraine.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Ukraine exports arms, with China, Saudi Arabia, and India being major importers. However, the evidence does not provide the percentage of arms sales by Ukraine, nor does it specify the origin of the arms being sold. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.


## Final Judgement
The investigation revealed that while Ukraine receives significant military aid and has faced corruption issues, there is no evidence to support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. The search results provided information on arms imports and exports, but not the specific percentage of arms sales.

`false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The available evidence does not support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. While Ukraine is a major importer of arms, with the U.S. being a primary supplier, and there are reports of corruption and arms trafficking, there is no data on the percentage of arms sales by Ukraine, nor does it specify the origin of the arms being sold. Therefore, the claim is unsubstantiated.

Pro-Kremlin social media accounts and outlets have been spreading a [baseless narrative](https://www.snopes.com/news/2025/01/13/wildfires-ukraine-mansions/)
 that mansions belonging to Ukrainian military officers burned down [in the Los Angeles wildfires](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/15/nx-s1-5260939/fires-los-angeles-palisades-eaton-wildfires-winds)
. Pro-Kremlin social media accounts have spread baseless claims that Ukrainian military officials owned mansions that were destroyed in the fires that swept the Los Angeles region.

"It is the latest in a long string of assertions by Russian officials, media, and the pro-Kremlin online ecosystem that Ukrainian officials are corrupt and use foreign aid money to enrich themselves." Léa Ronzaud, a senior investigator at research firm Graphika, told NPR in an email.

[!Russian navy recruits perform with the Russian flag in St. <image:13932>](https://www.npr.org/2024/06/06/g-s1-2965/russia-propaganda-deepfakes-sham-websites-social-media-ukraine)

"It's just so typical of what we see from Russia, \[to\] take advantage of an ongoing crisis for their own ends," said Darren Linvill, a communications professor and co-director of Clemson University's Media Forensics Hub.

The Ukrainian general story first emerged on a pro-Russian Telegram channel four days after the fires started in Los Angeles. Some of the posts amplifying the baseless claim falsely credited it to United24 Media, a website affiliated with the Ukrainian government.

The Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council's Center for Countering Disinformation issued a [statement](https://x.com/CforCD/status/1878381491056501245)
 describing the claim as "Russian propaganda." It said it had verified with United24 Media that it did not create or share the story.

NPR has not obtained evidence that any Ukrainian generals owned homes in Los Angeles that were destroyed by the fires. Both @OlgaBazova and Patterson's posts received user-generated community notes on X citing the Greek fact check.

The unverified claim about the alleged Ukrainian-owned mansions also appeared on other social media platforms including Tik Tok, TruthSocial and the Russian site VK, but did not gain much traction.

The story is the latest example of Russia's shift away from using fake social media profiles impersonating real people, as it did during the 2016 and 2020 U.S. Accounts tied to previous China influence operations spread false claims about the fire's origins.

While the story about Ukrainian officials got more traction than the other narratives about the fires originating from Russia-allied channels, Linvill said, it has not yet spread as widely as previous narratives linked to Russia."

!Briefing Of The Commander-In-Chief Of The Armed Forces Of Ukraine Valerii Zaluzhnyi <image:13951>

General Valerii Zaluzhnyi was among those reported to have a home in Los Angeles, even though he lives in London now as Ukraine's ambassador to the UK. The Russian propaganda effort is thus to encourage support for the war at home while making those in the West question any aid that has been sent to Kyiv.

"People predisposed to believing narratives like this will take it to be another 'false' datapoint of corruption and largesse in the Ukrainian military, and at the same time, a sweet act of karma that these imaginary mansions are burning to the ground," said Schmidt. The total value of these properties amounts to $90 million and was allegedly purchased with funds provided by the West as part of economic aid to Kyiv after the war began."

Subsequent posts [named Valerii Zaluzhnyi](https://t.me/naspravdiinfo/104501 "https://t.me/naspravdiinfo/104501")
, former Ukrainian four-star general and current ambassador of Ukraine to the United Kingdom, as being among those who have lost their homes.

Satire, But Really Disinformation
---------------------------------

The initial post on Telegram did indeed include the hashtag "сатира" (Russian for satire), but subsequent reposts lacked any mention that it was made in jest. Yet, even as "satire," it isn't clear where the humor lies in the original post, except possibly to Russian audiences who might find joy that any Ukrainian would see their home burns down in the devastating California fires.

"There is zero evidence that any Ukrainian generals own any property in L.A., much less mansions," said Dr. It's not just about the misinformation – it's about how quickly it crosses platforms and gains traction."

Disinformation Fits An Existing Narrative
-----------------------------------------

All of these disinformation campaigns have a common thread – they're based on the unsubstantiated belief that Ukrainian officials are getting rich while the war continues. Matthew Schmidt, professor of national security and political science at the University of New Haven.

Humor likely wasn't even the point, and instead, the channels posting the claims likely wanted it to be believed as fact – much like the news last summer that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spent $15 million to [buy a Mercedes 770 automobile](https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2024/10/09/despite-online-claims-ukraines-zelensky-didnt-buy-hitlers-car/ "https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2024/10/09/despite-online-claims-ukraines-zelensky-didnt-buy-hitlers-car/")
 that was previously owned by Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler, or that Zelensky's wife purchased a [Bugatti sports car](https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2024/07/02/social-media-posts-claim-zelenskys-wife-spent-millions-on-bugatti-sportscar/ "https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2024/07/02/social-media-posts-claim-zelenskys-wife-spent-millions-on-bugatti-sportscar/")

A post [shared on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=3936628693283593&id=100008095036730)
 claims billionaire Elon Musk posted a “last dollar” for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

**Verdict: False**

There is no evidence that Musk posted this.

**Fact Check:**

Musk joined President-elect Donald Trump on his phone call with Zelenskyy, according to [The Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-ukraine-elon-musk-zelenskyy-starlink-f6ab0c5e1c5de1262ae2a1747247819c)
. Musk has become a part of Trump’s inner circle, the outlet reported.

Social media users are claiming that Musk posted that Zelenskyy had received his “last dollar.” These claims show an image of a purported tweet from Musk, which states, “The last dollar for Zelenskiy” and is accompanied by a dollar with Trump in the middle.

These claims are false. 6 tweet.

> [](https://twitter.com/CforCD/status/1854169532924891301?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

“The tweet attributed to Elon Musk about the alleged ‘last dollar for Zelenskyy’ featuring a bill with Donald Trump’s portrait is fake. This is fabricated content intended for manipulation and provocation,” reads the tweet.

Logically Facts also [debunked](https://www.logicallyfacts.com/en/fact-check/no-elon-musk-didnt-post-the-last-dollar-for-zelenskyy)
 this claim, saying that Ukrainian and Russian Telegram channels spread the fake image, though noted the Ukrainian channels said it was satire.

From [Source](https://www.politico.eu/article/billionaire-elon-musk-mocks-ukraine-president-zelenskyy-asking-aid-with-meme/): 
Content: "[Skip to main content](#main)

Billionaire entrepreneur [Elon Musk mocked Ukraine’s war-time leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1708629197617336398)
 on Monday, using a meme to scoff at the president’s calls for Western aid.

“When it’s been 5 min and you haven’t asked for a billion dollars in aid,” read Musk’s message, which accompanied Zelenskyy’s head attached to a famous photo of an agitated schoolboy, who — according to the [meme’s etymology](https://medium.com/@tazreen.noman/the-origin-of-michael-mcgee-vein-popping-guy-ad41c63190f0)
 — was in a classroom and desperately trying to hold in flatulence.

Musk has had a troubled relationship with Ukrainians and the country’s administration since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion in February 2022, but now they’ve had just about enough of the SpaceX chief and owner of X (formerly Twitter).

“So you have bought social media to bully people who are dying because \[they\] love freedom,” Ukrainian stand-up comedian Anton Tymoshenko [wrote](https://twitter.com/_Tymoshenko/status/1708716338196214196)
 in response to Musk’s post.

“Elon, did you write this meme during a friendly conversation with Putin on the phone?” another Ukrainian comic and volunteer, Vasyl Baydak, [wrote](https://twitter.com/by_by_duck/status/1708711638268878922)
 — alluding to a [New Yorker report](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/08/28/elon-musks-shadow-rule)
 that Musk and the Russian president spoke directly.

Even Ukrainian media organizations joined the anti-Musk revolt, with top publication Ukrainska Pravda [posting](https://twitter.com/pravda_eng/status/1708732658182701406?s=20)
 the same meme, but with Musk’s face photoshopped in, saying: “When’s it’s been 5 minutes and you haven’t spread Russian propaganda.”

Zelenskyy has not yet reacted to Musk’s post. But that narrative flipped after he began spreading what Ukraine said was [pro-Russian propaganda](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/03/ukrainian-officials-and-allies-rail-against-elon-musk-tweet-00060085)
 via his social media.

According to a new biography of the tech boss, Musk also secretly ordered his engineers to [disable Starlink satellite](https://www.politico.eu/article/elon-musk-ukraine-starlink-russia-crimea-war-drone-submarine-attack-sabotage/)
 communications near the coast of Russian-occupied Crimea last year to sabotage a planned Ukrainian drone strike.

Last week, the [European Commission slammed Musk’s X](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_NCu44_Xc0)
 as the social media platform which is the biggest source of disinformation. President Joe Biden [signed](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/09/30/biden-administration-congress-government-shutdown-deal-ukraine-aid-00119296)
 a temporary budget bill featuring no Ukraine aid to avert the American government’s shutdown.

Shortly after Putin’s assault on Kyiv began last year, Musk was hailed in Ukraine thanks to his early decision to provide Starlink satellite internet for the country. But one of his office advisers, Serhiy Leshchenko, hit back [in a tweet](https://twitter.com/Leshchenkos/status/1708720295681421701)
 accusing Musk of “trolling.”

Musk’s meme comes shortly after U.S."

**_UNITED24_** **did not report such information, and neither did any other credible source.**

Ukraine has found an alternative to the American satellite system Starlink, a number of pro-Russian sources [report](https://archive.ph/JTBdd)
 citing _UNITED24_. At the same time while commenting on this decision communications officer Ruslana Danilkina allegedly spoke obscenely about Elon Musk in the context of his recent comments about Ukraine.

! On her [personal page](https://www.instagram.com/rusya_danilkina/)
, she also did not publish any offensive comments about Elon Musk, and did not comment on this news invented by propagandists.

For now, Ukraine continues to use the Starlink system, despite the tensions in relations with the United States. They had previously used the _UNITED24_ brand identity to spread the fake that [eight villas of Ukrainian generals burned down in Los Angeles.](https://www.stopfake.org/en/fake-eight-villas-belonging-to-ukrainian-generals-burned-down-in-los-angeles/)

And secondly, Ruslana Danilkina, who was called a communications officer in the video, does not actually currently hold combat positions in the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Electronic warfare equipment manufacturer and former Air Force officer Anatoly Khrapchinsky [considers](https://www.unian.ua/war/starlink-hrapchinskiy-poyasniv-chi-maye-ukrajina-alternativu-suputnikovomu-zv-yazku-12932037.html)

* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:19> This image shows a screenshot of an authentic X post from Elon Musk on November 6, 2025 saying 'The last dollar for Zelenskiy'."

## Actions
```
web_search("Elon Musk Zelenskiy last dollar")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The AOL article ([https://www.aol.com/fact-check-elon-musk-didn-164103080.html](https://www.aol.com/fact-check-elon-musk-didn-164103080.html)) fact-checks the claim that Elon Musk posted "The last dollar for Zelenskiy" and states the claim is false. The article provides an image of a purported tweet from Musk with the text "The last dollar for Zelenskiy" and a dollar bill with Trump's image <image:2360>. The article also mentions that a wider internet search and a review of Musk’s X account did not yield any results for this claim.

The Politico.eu article ([https://www.politico.eu/article/billionaire-elon-musk-mocks-ukraine-president-zelenskyy-asking-aid-with-meme/](https://www.politico.eu/article/billionaire-elon-musk-mocks-ukraine-president-zelenskyy-asking-aid-with-meme/)) discusses Elon Musk's meme mocking Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's calls for Western aid. The StopFake.org article ([https://www.stopfake.org/en/fake-ukraine-stopped-using-the-starlink-system-and-insulted-elon-musk-united24/](https://www.stopfake.org/en/fake-ukraine-stopped-using-the-starlink-system-and-insulted-elon-musk-united24/)) discusses a fake story about Ukraine stopping the use of Starlink and insulting Elon Musk.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates the claim is false. The AOL article fact-checks the claim and states it is false, providing an image of the purported tweet. A search of Musk's X account did not yield any results for the claim.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The fact-check reveals that the claim is false. The AOL article specifically fact-checks the claim that Elon Musk posted "The last dollar for Zelenskiy" and states it is false. A search of Musk's X account did not yield any results for this claim.

The claim is demonstrably false as it is disproven by evidence from a reliable source. `false`

One of Vladimir Putin’s luxury Aurus limousines (estimated cost: $356,000) caught fire after an explosion near the Federal Security Service (FSB) headquarters in Moscow on Saturday night, and the Kremlin went to an even higher-alert on the protection of its leader.

VIDEO: One of Putin’s Limos Goes up in Flames
=============================================

It’s paranoia as usual in the Kremlin as guards search other guards, sewer lines checked, and shots fired in Murmansk on Sunday. There were no reported injuries.

Putin reportedly ordered the sewers in the area checked as well as a pat-down of his own security staff.

A day after, videos showing gunfire from a rooftop in Murmansk surfaced on social media. 5, 2025

Newsweek AI is in beta. The cause of the fire is not known, and it is not clear whether the vehicle had been personally used by Putin, but the Russian leader has reportedly displayed paranoia about assassination plots.

What To Know
------------

The Aurus limousine blew up on Sretenka Street just north of the FSB headquarters in Lubyanka on Saturday night, with video footage showing the fire spreading to the vehicle's interior.

Onlookers can be seen watching back smoke billowing out of the front of the destroyed vehicle, and the rear of the car also seemed to be damaged.

It is not clear who was using the car, but it is said to be owned by Putin's Presidential Property Management Department, British newspaper _The Sun_ reported. The independent Russian language outlet Meduza [said that Putin](https://www.newsweek.com/putin-decries-massive-blunder-after-top-general-assassinated-2003548)
 had called the incident a major security lapse.

Video from Putin's visit last week to the Arctic city of Murmansk showed servicemen from a ceremonial guard being patted down for hidden weapons or explosive devices before the president came to lay a wreath by the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.

What People Are Saying
----------------------

**_The Sun_ newspaper wrote:** "An Aurus limousine from Putin's 'official car fleet' blew up in a huge blast on a street just north of Moscow's FSB secret service headquarters in Lubyanka."

**Ukrainian X user Devana posted:** "Not just Russia is burning—even Putin's limo went boom. So hey, Vladimir—if even your car goes up in flames next to FSB HQ … maybe the system's cracking from within?"

What Happens Next
-----------------

Official comment about the car blast is unlikely, but security around Putin will continue to dominate headlines. [Russia's special services have ramped up](https://www.newsweek.com/putin-spending-personal-security-russia-ukraine-arrest-warrant-icc-1803885)

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Economic Times reports that one of Vladimir Putin's official limousines exploded in central Moscow, raising security concerns, amid speculation about threats within Putin's inner circle and rumors about his health. The article mentions that the explosion happened only days after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky suggested that Russia could suffer a major setback in the war. The article includes an image of Putin <image:2407> and was released on March 30, 2025.

The Kyiv Post reported on March 31, 2025, that one of Vladimir Putin's limousines caught fire after an explosion near the FSB headquarters in Moscow <image:2434>. The fire was thought to have started in the engine, and the Kremlin went to an even higher alert on the protection of its leader. ([https://www.kyivpost.com/post/49868](https://www.kyivpost.com/post/49868)) GB News published an article on April 25, 2025, by George Bunn, about an explosion <image:2446>.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that an explosion occurred involving one of Vladimir Putin's limousines. The Economic Times and Kyiv Post reported on the incident, with the latter mentioning the fire started in the engine. However, the evidence does not confirm that Putin died in the explosion. The GB News article, published on April 25, 2025, mentions an explosion, but it does not explicitly state that Putin died.

The available information does not verify the claim that Putin died in the explosion.

To verify the claim, information is missing about Putin's status following the explosion.

In a dramatic scene near Moscow's FSB headquarters on Lubyanka Street, one of Russian President Vladimir Putin's luxury limousines exploded and caught fire, reports the Serbian news outlet [Kurir](https://www.kurir.rs/planeta/9627201/eksplodirala-putinova-limuzina-aurus-senat-u-moskvi)
.

The blaze, which started in the engine of the €330,000 special-purpose "Aurus Senat" vehicle, rapidly advanced into the interior. Fortunately, no casualties were recorded, although initial reports suggested someone might have been inside at the time.

Known for his preference for domestically produced vehicles, President Putin recently gifted a similar limousine to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. Officers painstakingly searched all manhole covers and trash bins near a location where Putin intended to speak in Moscow.

On February 3 explosion rocked a luxury apartment complex, "Scarlet Sails," in Moscow. The blast caused Sarkisyan's leg amputation, and according to [Russian media](https://ura.news/news/1052883866)
, he succumbed shortly in intensive care without regaining consciousness, with shrapnel wounds near the heart cited as the preliminary cause of death.

Comments
--------

* * * Additional footage from a different angle shows damage to the vehicle's rear section as well.

According to reports, the limousine is managed by the Russian President's asset management department. The incident coincides with heightened "paranoia over potential assassination attempts" surrounding the Russian leader.

A troubling recent incident during Putin's visit to Murmansk highlights these security concerns. A video surfaced showing a ceremonial Russian guard undergoing a humiliating process: each soldier was thoroughly searched by an officer from the Federal Protective Service for concealed weapons or explosives before Putin laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Reportedly, the honor guard was issued rifles with no ammunition due to fears of an assassination, possibly even from within Putin's own security.

Security around Putin continues to dominate headlines, as evidenced by another recent case reflecting the Kremlin's "profound concern" for Putin's safety. He was known as Arman Gorlovsky and faced international warrant for assassination-related charges.

As [Kommersant](https://t.me/kommersant/78064)
 explains, the bomb detonated as Sarkisyan and his guards entered the building, resulting in a guard's death and injuries to others."

One of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s limousines erupted in flames near Moscow’s Federal Security Service (FSB) headquarters on Saturday, igniting intense speculation about the cause and timing of the incident. However, the fire comes just days after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy ominously suggested that Putin “will die soon.”

The Fiery Incident
------------------

According to reports, the luxury Aurus Senat limousine, a Russian-made vehicle known for its high-security features, was traveling through Moscow when it suddenly caught fire. The fire in his limousine, whether coincidental or intentional, adds another layer of mystery to the complex web of security challenges surrounding the Kremlin.

Zelenskyy’s Ominous Warning
---------------------------

Days before the incident, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made an alarming prediction about Putin’s fate, stating that the Russian leader “will die soon.” While Zelenskyy did not elaborate on whether he expected Putin to be overthrown, assassinated, or succumb to [**health**](https://bronx.com/nurse-practitioner-takes-the-lead-as-best-healthcare-job-in-2024/)
 issues, his comments have fueled speculation about growing instability within Russia.

Ukraine and its allies have long hoped for a change in Russia’s leadership, believing that Putin’s removal could lead to a shift in the ongoing war. High-profile defections, unexplained deaths of top officials, and growing frustration among the Russian elite suggest that Putin’s grip on power may not be as firm as it once was.

The limousine fire, regardless of its cause, serves as a reminder that even the most fortified leaders are not immune to unforeseen events. The fire in Putin’s limousine may be a minor incident in the grand scheme of things, or it may be a harbinger of greater upheaval to come. Given Putin’s reliance on a tightly controlled security apparatus, even a minor incident like this raises questions about potential threats to his safety.

A Pattern of Security Concerns
------------------------------

This incident is the latest in a string of security-related concerns surrounding Putin. Intelligence reports suggest that Putin rarely stays in the same location for extended periods and avoids technology that could expose his whereabouts.

Previously, there have been rumors of attempts to poison or assassinate him, though no concrete evidence has surfaced. However, Russian political experts caution that any power vacuum in the Kremlin could lead to further unpredictability, as rival factions within the Russian government and military vie for control.

Is Putin’s Power Slipping?
--------------------------

Putin has ruled Russia for over two decades, consolidating immense power and eliminating opposition. Some analysts believe that if Putin begins to face significant internal threats, he may resort to even harsher measures to maintain control.

Kremlin’s Response and Next Steps
---------------------------------

In response to the incident, Russian state media has downplayed the fire, dismissing it as a minor accident with no broader implications. However, opposition figures and international analysts see it as yet another example of the growing challenges facing Putin’s administration.

Russia’s FSB is expected to conduct a full investigation into the fire, though it is unclear whether the results will be made public."

The Economic Times reports that one of Vladimir Putin's official limousines exploded in central Moscow, raising security concerns, amid speculation about threats within Putin's inner circle and rumors about his health. The article mentions that the explosion happened only days after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky suggested that Russia could suffer a major setback in the war. The article includes an image of Putin <image:2407> and was released on March 30, 2025. ([https://m.economictimes.com/news/international/world-news/blast-in-one-of-vladimir-putins-official-limousines-triggers-fresh-assassination-concerns/articleshow/119758547.cms](https://m.economictimes.com/news/international/world-news/blast-in-one-of-vladimir-putins-official-limousines-triggers-fresh-assassination-concerns/articleshow/119758547.cms))

The Kyiv Post reported on March 31, 2025, that one of Vladimir Putin's limousines caught fire after an explosion near the FSB headquarters in Moscow <image:2434>. The fire was thought to have started in the engine, and the Kremlin went to an even higher alert on the protection of its leader. ([https://www.kyivpost.com/post/49868](https://www.kyivpost.com/post/49868)) GB News published an article on April 25, 2025, by George Bunn, about an explosion <image:2446>. ([https://www.gbnews.com/news/world/vladimir-putin-chief-killed-moscow-car-explosion](https://www.gbnews.com/news/world/vladimir-putin-chief-killed-moscow-car-explosion))


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that an explosion occurred involving one of Vladimir Putin's limousines. The Economic Times and Kyiv Post reported on the incident, with the latter mentioning the fire started in the engine. However, the evidence does not confirm that Putin died in the explosion. The GB News article, published on April 25, 2025, mentions an explosion, but it does not explicitly state that Putin died.

The available information does not verify the claim that Putin died in the explosion.

To verify the claim, information is missing about Putin's status following the explosion.

CNBC TV18 reports that one of Vladimir Putin's limousines caught fire after an explosion in Moscow near the FSB headquarters <image:0>.

The cause of the fire is unknown, and there were no reports of injuries. The articles do not mention whether Putin was in the vehicle at the time of the incident.


## Elaboration
The new evidence confirms that an explosion and fire occurred involving one of Putin's limousines near the FSB headquarters in Moscow. However, the evidence does not mention Putin's presence in the vehicle or any injuries.

The claim that Putin died in the explosion cannot be verified with the available information.

From [Source](https://bronx.com/putins-limo-blows-up-days-after-zelenskyy-said-he-would-die-soon/): 
Content: The Bronx.com reports that one of Vladimir Putin's limousines caught fire near Moscow's FSB headquarters on March 29, 2025. The article mentions that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that Putin "will die soon" days before the incident. The article does not mention Putin's health status after the explosion. <image:13952>


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that one of Vladimir Putin's limousines exploded and caught fire near the FSB headquarters in Moscow. However, none of the provided sources confirm that Putin was in the vehicle or that he died in the explosion. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that while there was an explosion involving one of Vladimir Putin's limousines, there is no evidence to support the claim that he died in the explosion. Multiple sources confirm the explosion and fire, but none mention Putin's presence in the vehicle or his death.

The most appropriate decision option is `false`.

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The fact-check reveals that while there was an explosion involving one of Vladimir Putin's limousines, as reported by sources like the [Economic Times](https://m.economictimes.com/news/international/world-news/blast-in-one-of-vladimir-putins-official-limousines-triggers-fresh-assassination-concerns/articleshow/119758547.cms) and the [Kyiv Post](https://www.kyivpost.com/post/49868), there is no evidence to support the claim that he died in the explosion.

Clips of Hegseth calling Vladimir Putin a "war criminal" appeared online after he was nominated as secretary of defense by President-elect Donald Trump. Think about it through the psychology of him."

The Facts

While Hegseth aligned with the claim that Putin was a "war criminal," the clip shared online was from March 2022 not long after the outbreak of the conflict.

Since then Hegseth has been more cautious, and critical of the U.S. spending on the conflict, claims appeared on social media repeating comments Hegseth had made criticizing Russian President [Vladimir Putin](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/vladimir-putin)
 in bold terms.

!Pete Hegseth <image:2703>

Pete Hegseth on May 31, 2019, in New York City. intervention in Ukraine and the prognosis from others that Russia's intervention would lead to wider conflict.

In an episode of the _Shawn Ryan Show_ Podcast from November 2024, Hegseth said he did not see Putin taking the world into a wider global or nuclear conflict, saying his gains would be incremental, part of what he called a "get my s\*\*\* back" conflict.

"I found it overinflated from the beginning this idea that Vladimir Putin's attack on Ukraine was going to lead to nuclear war or war across the continent," Hegseth said.

"I've always felt like it was from the beginning, like a couple days in, I like, this feels like the Putin's 'give me my s\*\*\* back' war.

"It kind of feels like \[Putin thought\] 'I feel like you've been pushing pretty hard, and we used to have the former Soviet Union, and we're pretty proud of that, and Ukraine was a part of it, and all these other... I think he probably knows enough to know that it's probably not going much further than Ukraine.

"And I don't think he's a suicidal maniac who's hell-bent on bringing in armageddon with nuclear warfare."

Elsewhere, he has also defended Trump's comment in 2022 calling Putin "very savvy" after the Russian president announced Moscow's recognition of the independence of [two self-proclaimed republics](https://www.newsweek.com/blinken-says-swift-response-needed-russia-recognizing-new-republics-1681212)
 in eastern Ukraine.

While the White House and the [EU](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/eu)
 described Putin's actions as a violation of international law and a pretext for an invasion, Trump said [Putin's move was "genius" and "very savvy."](https://www.newsweek.com/trump-calls-putin-moving-troops-ukraine-peacekeeping-genius-1681557)

Hegseth defended the comments saying that Trump was trying to tease the media for obsessing over the Russian leader

"Here's the reality, Vladimir Putin lives rent-free in the minds of our media, of the American media," Hegseth said.

"No organism, no entity has done more to spread Russian propaganda and to prop up the strawman that is Vladimir Putin than our very own media."

In a [Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/video/6320895317112)
 interview in February 2023 with South Carolina [Republican](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/republican)
 Representative [Nancy Mace](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/nancy-mace)
, Hegseth criticized the number of times President [Joe Biden](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/joe-biden)
 had visited Ukraine compared to the southern border of the U.S., and the "billions spent in Ukraine" suggesting he was ignoring "our problems at home."

He also asked "what do we get out of" the billions the U.S."

Trump this week suggested NATO enlargement provoked Russia to invade Ukraine, but Wicker didn't agree.

“There are good guys and bad guys in this war, and the Russians are the bad guys,” Wicker said. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth made a “rookie mistake” when he said a return to Ukraine’s pre-war borders was “unrealistic,” Senate Armed Services Chair Roger Wicker said Friday.

Hegseth on Thursday [pulled back some of the comments](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/13/hegseth-pull-back-00204088)
 he made about Ukraine a day earlier, where he said that NATO membership for Kyiv was off the table and that the country could not return to its internationally recognized borders. 

“Hegseth is going to be a great defense secretary, although he wasn’t my choice for the job,” the Mississippi Republican [told POLITICO on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference](https://www.politico.eu/politico-munich-security-conference-2025/)
. Wicker said he favors a firm posture with Moscow.

“Everybody knows … and people in the administration know you don't say before your first meeting what you will agree to and what you won't agree to,” Wicker said, adding that he was “puzzled” and “disturbed” by Hegseth’s comments.

President Donald Trump this week held a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on ending the war; Vice President JD Vance will meet in Munich Friday with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Hegseth wasn't freelancing. “But he made a rookie mistake in Brussels and he’s walked back some of what he said but not that line."

"I don’t know who wrote the speech — it is the kind of thing Tucker Carlson could have written, and Carlson is a fool," Wicker said, referring to the pro-Putin broadcaster.

Speaking to Jonathan Martin at the POLITICO Pub in the Munich conference, Wicker — a staunch Ukraine supporter — said he was “surprised” by Hegseth’s original comments and “heartened” that the new defense secretary had reversed course. Trump on Thursday said there was a "good possibility of ending that horrible, very bloody war." He also said it was not "practical" for Kyiv to join NATO and "unlikely" that Ukraine could return to its 2014 pre-invasion borders.

The direct talks between Trump and Putin have left European allies rattled that the EU and Ukraine could be sidelined in any peace deal.

Amid Trump’s talks with Putin, Wicker took a more hawkish stance that is in line with traditional Republican views. resolve, arguing that failing to arm Ukraine could force American troops into future wars.

On Friday, Wicker also called for the U.S."

 of Kentucky, one of three Republicans who voted against Hegseth’s confirmation, who warned, "America’s reputation is on the line."

McConnell, now chair of the panel overseeing defense funding, issued some of his strongest public criticism yet, questioning whether the United States would continue defending democratic allies against authoritarian threats.

He contrasted his stance — rooted in a Reagan-era commitment to global leadership — with Hegseth’s "America First" approach favored by many Trump supporters. "We don’t want a headline at the end of this conflict that says [Russia](https://kyivindependent.com/tag/russia/)

When asked who the aggressor in the three-year-old war is, [Hegseth](https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-bracing-for-painful-reduction-in-us-military-aid-after-hegseth-announces-cuts/)
 responded, "Russia is the aggressor." But he avoided directly stating which side the U.S. wants to see win, instead emphasizing that President Trump is committed to achieving peace.

An F-16 Fighting Falcon rests inside a warehouse near March Air Reserve Base after crashing on May 16, 2019. The missiles on board did not explode. The plane suffered a loss of hydraulic pressure, rendering the pilot unable to control the jet, the U.S. Air Force said April 23, 2020. (Courtesy of U.S. Air Force)

The U.S. Air Force has answered a questioned that burned in people’s minds as bystanders were hurriedly pushed back to safer locations several times and the 215 Freeway was closed after [the crash of an Air National Guard F-16 fighter jet](https://www.pressenterprise.com/2019/05/16/plane-crashes-near-march-air-reserve-base-215-freeway-shut-down/)
 near March Air Reserve Base in 2019:

Why didn’t the missiles aboard the Flying Falcon explode on impact?

The reason, the Air Force said this week, is that the ordnance attached to the F-16 during its intercept training mission were never armed.

“Aircraft flying this mission do fly with live ordnance. In order for the weapons to detonate, there are multiple conditions that must be met, including arming and launching of the weapon to complete the detonation sequences,” said Capt. Tisha J. Yates, an Air Force spokeswoman at Joint Base Langley-Eustis in Virginia.

The missiles were eventually removed from the jet as it sat in a warehouse on Opportunity Way near the Riverside-Moreno Valley border. They were trucked to nearby Ben Clark Training Center, [where they were destroyed in a controlled detonation](https://www.pressenterprise.com/2019/05/17/x-9/)
.

“The determination to move civilians away from the scene was a safety measure put in place by the incident commander on scene and in coordination with NORAD based on the hazards present until all munitions were secured,” Yates said in response to questions from this news organization, [which first reported the cause of the crash](https://www.pressenterprise.com/2020/04/23/hydraulic-failure-caused-f-16-to-crash-near-march-base-last-year-air-force-says/)
.

The F-16 was assigned to the 114th Fighter Wing at Joe Foss Field in South Dakota. The pilot was attached to the 144th Fighter Wing at March.

On May 16, 2019, the pilot was returning from the two-jet maneuvers about 120 miles east of March when he lost hydraulic pressure and therefore the ability to control the aircraft. At 3:39 p.m., after burning off fuel, he ejected about 250 feet off the ground less than a mile from the base. The pilot suffered minor injuries, as did about a dozen people in the warehouse where the plane crashed.

The Air Force concluded in its 22-page accident report that the $24 million jet lost the fluid from its two hydraulic tanks when two inlet check valves — each less than an inch tall — failed because they were improperly installed.

Each valve consists of a cap, screw threads, a retainer ring and an O-ring that collectively are referred to as a screw cap. That screw cap screws into the valve body. The retainer helps keep the O-ring in place. It is primarily the screw cap retainer and O-ring that prevent hydraulic fluid from leaking under high pressure.

The investigation determined that both screw caps were not properly screwed into the valve bodies. The retainers were found to be deformed, and portions of the O-rings were missing. As a result, hydraulic fluid leaked out through the threads between the screw caps and the valve bodies.

A suspected hydraulic leak had been noted in the jet in March 2019. A new flight-control system that had been overhauled months earlier was installed on March 28, and the plane flew 10 more missions without incident before the crash. The report concluded that the overhaul process lacked “an effective procedure to identify improper installation of ISA check valves.” ISA stands for Integrated Servo Actuator, a flight-control system.

In the wake of the crash, the Air Force also said this week that it studied the overhaul process and found a problem with how the inlet check valve was assembled during overhauls, said Derek Kaufman, a civilian spokesman for the Air Force Materiel Command at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio.

There are two approved configurations of the valves. The older configuration uses smaller Teflon backing rings, and newer configurations use larger rings. The team discovered the potential for installation of the wrong-size backing ring since both size rings were packaged side by side, Kaufman said.

As a result, the Air Force changed the process for assembling the valves during overhauls. It separated the installation and inspection steps on the work documentation and added a secondary quality check for just O-ring backing ring installation. And it inserted a “quality stamp” of the entire process for the first six months after the changes to ensure proper training was accomplished.

The Air Force also inspected all of its inlet check valves and found three to be defective. Those were fixed, Kaufman said.

“We review the facts for any lessons that can be applied to maintenance processes and training to improve the safety and quality of systems we deliver to our warfighters,” he said.

The improper installation of two parts caused an [F-16](/weapons/f-16/ "Learn more about the F-16 Fighting Falcon")
‘s hydraulic system to fail, making the pilot [lose control and crash into a warehouse in May 2019](https://www.airforcemag.com/f-16-crashes-during-norad-training-in-california/)
 while flying back to March Air Reserve Base, Calif., Air Force investigators found.

The F-16 pilot successfully ejected before the Viper crashed into the civilian building. The aircraft was destroyed at a loss of $24.99 million, and caused about $3.9 million in damage to the warehouse, according to an Air Combat Command Accident Investigation Board report.

The F-16C, tail number 88-0477 from the South Dakota Air National Guard’s 114th Fighter Wing, was operated by a pilot from the California Air National Guard’s 144th Fighter Wing Detachment 1 at March for homeland defense missions. On May 16, 2019, the F-16C took off as part of a two-ship formation for an aerospace control alert training mission in a nearby military operating area.

The two F-16s flew one-versus-one tactical intercepts, low-level proficiency training, and local area familiarization. While flying near Palm Springs, the pilot began receiving cockpit warnings of a potential hydraulic system issue with gauges showing low pressure and began going through appropriate checklists, according to the report.

About 20 miles from base, the pilot deployed speed brakes and lowered the landing gear to burn more fuel and let the wingman visually inspect the aircraft. With the speed brakes and gear deployed and locked, the pilot did not yet declare an emergency, but continued the approach to March, the report states.

The aircraft then indicated further loss of pressure in both of its “A and B” systems, and the pilot consulted checklists for dual hydraulic failure. Once they got close to the base, the wingman landed first on one of the base’s runways, allowing the damaged F-16 to land on a runway with an arresting cable.

With both hydraulic systems failing, the pilot declared an emergency and turned on emergency power as a precaution before starting a straight-in approach to the runway. About one mile before touching down, at about 300 feet above ground level, the F-16 began to roll to the left without any pilot input. The pilot tried to maintain control, and counter the roll, but the aircraft rolled hard to the right in a way that was inconsistent with the pilot’s input.

After losing control of the aircraft, the pilot ejected. Immediately after punching out, the F-16 crashed into the warehouse, located across a major highway from the base. A photograph of the impact shows the F-16’s nose sheared off and wings largely removed in a pile of boxes and equipment. The pilot parachuted onto the runway overrun at the base, and was briefly hospitalized with minor injuries.

The Accident Investigation Board found that the cause of the mishap was two improperly installed hydraulic check valves in the aircraft’s right flaperon integrated survoactuator—a part that translates electrical commands to the movement of flight control surfaces. For both of the parts that failed, investigators found the same problem: the retainer on a screw cap had deformed, with fragments tearing away allowing fluid to leak.

“This condition allowed hydraulic fluid to leak from both systems resulting in decreased hydraulic pressure to move flight control surfaces,” the report said. “The \[pilot\] set up to land as soon as possible, but the system had lost enough pressure on final approach to prevent the \[aircraft\] from sustaining controlled flight.”

Maintainers with the 144th Fighter Wing Detachment 1 installed the parts as part of unscheduled maintenance in March 2019 after a possible hydraulic leak was discovered. The parts went through operational checks with no discrepancies found, and the aircraft had flown 10 sorties for 16.3 hours before the crash. The AIB states that there was an inadequate overhaul process, which lacked an effective procedure to identify problems with the installation of the check valves.

A loss of hydraulic pressure prevented the pilot of the Air National Guard’s F-16 [that crashed near March Air Reserve Base](https://www.pe.com/2019/05/16/plane-crashes-near-march-air-reserve-base-215-freeway-shut-down/)
 last year from controlling the jet, the U.S. Air Force says in a report.

The pilot ejected and parachuted onto a base runway on May 16, 2019, suffering minor injuries. The $24 million Fighting Falcon plummeted through the roof of a warehouse, destroying the jet and causing a small fire.

Twelve people in the warehouse were treated for exposure to the debris, the Cal Fire/Riverside County Fire Department said at the time.

The 22-page report, dated April 14, said two inlet-check valves were improperly installed, resulting in damage to them that caused hydraulic fuel to leak.

The valves were part of a flight-control system that was overhauled in January 2019 and installed in the jet after a possible hydraulic leak was discovered several months later.

“The evidence also indicated an inadequate overhaul process that lacked an effective procedure to identify improper installation of ISA check valves,” the report says.

The F-16 was one of two jets initially practicing 120 miles east of March, which sits on the Riverside-Moreno Valley border. The planes were returning to March when the one jet lost hydraulic pressure.

The pilot burned off fuel before ejecting, the report says.

The F-16 was assigned to the 114th Fighter Wing at Joe Foss Field in South Dakota and ran some missions for the 144th Fighter Wing at March.

Ukraine blows up two key Russian bridges using Moscow’s own mines and $600 drones

Ukraine has said it destroyed two bridges inside Russia by using a couple of cheap drones to hit stashes of mines and ammunition hidden there by Russian forces.

The Ukrainian military said the two bridges near the border with Ukraine’s Kharkiv region were being used by the Russian military to resupply their troops.

Because of their strategic importance, the bridges were mined – so that the Russian military had the option of blowing them up in case of a sudden Ukrainian advance.

It is not unusual for an army under attack to destroy bridges, roads and other key infrastructure on its own territory to prevent the enemy from advancing. The move delayed the Russian advance and protected the Ukrainian capital.

In the case of the two bridges in Russia, the Ukrainian military found out about the stashes of mines and used it to its own advantage.

Ukraine Armed Forces — 58th Separate Motorized Infantry Brigade

Ukraine’s 58th Separate Motorized Infantry Brigade, which conducted the operation, told CNN that they decided have a closer look at the bridge after noticing unusual activity around it.

“It became clear that something was going on there. We found it was also mined and we struck,” the brigade representative said, adding: “(We) saw an opportunity and took it.”

The bridges’ destruction – and the daring way Ukraine achieved it – is a rare piece of good news for Kyiv.

Ukraine is facing a tough situation along the frontlines as Russian troops continue to inch forward as Russian President Vladimir Putin continues to delay any ceasefire talks.

At the same time, Moscow keeps terrorizing Ukraine’s civilian population with near daily deadly aerial attacks against cities across the country.

Russia did not comment on the attacks against the bridges.

Cheap drones prove their value
------------------------------

The drones used in the attack costs between 25,000 and 30,000 Ukrainian hryvnas, or between $600 to $725, the brigade representative told CNN.

That makes the two attacks extremely cost-effective. CNN has geolocated the bridge seen in the video to the Belgorod region in southern Russia, near the border with Ukraine.

“After that, we decided to check the other bridge. Under normal circumstances, it would require expensive guided munitions delivered by a sophisticated system such as a missile launcher or plane.

Ukraine has previously said it used the Western-supplied High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) to blow up bridges in Russia’s Kursk region."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:22>

## Elaboration
The image appears to be a meme. The background shows a damaged aircraft with Ukrainian markings. The foreground features two "soyjak" characters, a type of internet meme, which suggests the image is satirical.

The evidence does not provide information about the type of aircraft or the cause of the damage. Therefore, the claim that the image shows a Ukrainian F-16 fighter jet shot down by Russia cannot be verified.

Ukraine claims to have damaged Russian fighter jets in night-time raid
======================================================================

This article is more than 2 months old

Special forces reportedly launched assault on Russian airfield about 400 miles from Ukrainian border

Ukrainian special forces claim to have damaged two fighter jets in a night-time raid on an airfield deep inside [Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia)
 as Kyiv seeks to disrupt Vladimir Putin’s steady advances on the frontline.

A week after the spectacle of [Operation Spiderweb, when drones struck the Kremlin’s nuclear-capable bombers](https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2025/jun/04/ukraine-releases-dramatic-fpv-footage-of-drone-attack-on-russian-airbases-video)
, the general staff of the Ukrainian army claimed a fresh success.

Special operations forces were said to have launched an assault on the Savasleyka airfield, located in the Nizhny Novgorod region of Russia, about 400 miles from the Ukrainian border.

The army did not provide any details about the nature of the operation and questions remain about the extent of the damage inflicted.

The airfield is used by Russia to deploy MiG-31K fighters carrying Kinzhal ballistic missiles that have been used against Ukrainian armed forces and its cities.

“According to preliminary information, two units of enemy aircraft were hit (probably MiG-31 and Su-30/34 aircraft),” the general staff said in a statement. It has been claimed that this is the home of Ukraine’s F-16 fighter jets although this could not be independently verified.

Explosions were also heard in Kyiv, where Tymur Tkachenko, the head of the Kyiv city military administration, reported that an office building in the capital’s Darnytsia district had been damaged.

The Ukrainian authorities claimed that their air defences destroyed 277 drones and 19 missiles in mid-flight, with only 10 drones or missiles successfully striking their targets.

In recent weeks, Russian forces have made significant advances in the Sumy region, pushing within 18 miles of the eponymous regional capital, three years after Ukraine’s counteroffensive pushed the Kremlin’s forces out of the area.

The region’s governor, Oleh Hryhorov, said there was no need yet to evacuate Sumy city, describing the situation as “tense but under control of the defence forces”.

Ukraine has denied Moscow’s claims that Russian forces have pushed through the western border of Donetsk into the eastern Dnipropetrovsk region for the first time in the three years of the full-scale war.

Maj Andrii Kovalev, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s general staff, said: “The information is not true. We are doing everything we can to bring our people home.”

Video footage also emerged on Monday of a successful Ukrainian drone strike on a factory in Cheboksary, about 800 miles from the Ukrainian border, which makes components crucial to the targeting mechanisms in self-propelled howitzers, Iskander missile systems and Lancet and Shahed kamikaze drones.

Ukraine’s armed forces said the attack on the VNIIR-Progress plant, which is under US sanctions, had led the authorities in Russia to halt commercial flights in the region.

They said: “At present, the destruction of the facility by at least two UAVs \[unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones\] and the subsequent large-scale fire have been confirmed. The results of the destruction are being clarified.”

Oleg Nikolayev, the regional governor, said in a statement that production at the factory had been suspended but that the strikes had not caused any casualties.

The operations inside Russia came as the Kremlin stepped up its night-time missile and drone strikes and made progress in pushing back the frontline in the north-east Sumy region and in Donetsk in the east.

On Sunday night and in the early hours of Monday morning, Russia launched 479 drones at Ukraine in the war’s biggest overnight drone bombardment, the Ukrainian air force said.

About 20 missiles were also fired into Ukraine, targeting mainly central and western regions. The enemy did not enter Dnipropetrovsk oblast.”

 and Matt Nighswander

Satellite images of destroyed and damaged military aircraft on Russian bases have provided fresh details about Ukraine’s recent unprecedented drone attack on its powerful neighbor.

The images of destroyed and damaged aircraft, dated May 22 and June 4, show some of Russia's prized military assets parked and then destroyed.

Over the weekend, Ukraine's Security Service [said that it had struck more than 40 bombers](https://www.nbcnews.com/world/ukraine/ukraine-drone-strike-on-russian-airfield-rcna210210)
 deep inside Russian territory in an operation dubbed "Spiderweb." Video released by Ukraine showed drones targeting the Belaya air base in the Irktusk region, almost 3,000 miles from Ukraine.

The operation made headlines around the world, both as an example of Ukraine's willingness and ingenuity in expanding the war beyond the front lines as well as [the escalating risk that drones pose to military assets](https://www.nbcnews.com/world/ukraine/ukraines-massive-drone-attack-deep-russia-lays-bare-putins-vulnerabili-rcna210300)
 once thought to be far beyond the reach of adversaries.

Ukraine appears to have targeted Tu-95 and Tu-22 bombers, which are considered by military analysts to be [crucial to the Russian air force](https://www.twz.com/air/what-ukraines-unprecedented-drone-attack-means-for-russian-bomber-force)
.

Beyond the military importance, the destruction of the bombers was also a blow to Russia's international standing and the image of [its president, Vladimir Putin](https://www.nbcnews.com/world/ukraine/ukraines-massive-drone-attack-deep-russia-lays-bare-putins-vulnerabili-rcna210300)
.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that there have been instances of aircraft damage and destruction during the Russo-Ukrainian War. Specifically, Ukrainian forces have damaged or destroyed Russian aircraft using drones, and there is a record of an F-16 being lost. However, the evidence does not confirm the claim that the image shows a Ukrainian F-16 fighter jet shot down by Russia. The image's nature as a meme and the lack of specific details about the aircraft in the image make it impossible to verify the claim.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:22> This image shows a Ukrainian F-16 fighter jet which was shot down by Russia as part of the large-scale Russian invasion in Ukraine."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:22>)
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:22>

## Elaboration
The image appears to be a meme. The background shows a damaged aircraft with Ukrainian markings. The foreground features two "soyjak" characters, a type of internet meme, which suggests the image is satirical.

The evidence does not provide information about the type of aircraft or the cause of the damage. Therefore, the claim that the image shows a Ukrainian F-16 fighter jet shot down by Russia cannot be verified.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
CNN reported that in June 2025, Ukrainian forces damaged or destroyed dozens of Russian aircraft using drones. The Guardian reported that Ukraine claimed to have damaged Russian fighter jets in a night-time raid on an airfield in Russia on June 9, 2025. The Wikipedia article provides a list of aviation shootdowns and accidents during the Russo-Ukrainian War, including the loss of an ex-Danish Air Force F-16 on August 26, 2023.

### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://www.nbcnews.com/world/ukraine/ukraine-russia-drone-bombers-attack-satellite-images-rcna210943): 
Content: NBC News published an article on June 4, 2025, by Jason Abbruzzese and Matt Nighswander, discussing satellite images showing the destruction of Russian planes by Ukrainian drones. The article mentions Ukrainian drone strikes on Russian airfields, including the Belaya air base, and shows images of damaged Tu-95 and Tu-22 bombers <image:1>.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that there have been instances of aircraft damage and destruction during the Russo-Ukrainian War. Specifically, Ukrainian forces have damaged or destroyed Russian aircraft using drones, and there is a record of an F-16 being lost. However, the evidence does not confirm the claim that the image shows a Ukrainian F-16 fighter jet shot down by Russia. The image's nature as a meme and the lack of specific details about the aircraft in the image make it impossible to verify the claim.
