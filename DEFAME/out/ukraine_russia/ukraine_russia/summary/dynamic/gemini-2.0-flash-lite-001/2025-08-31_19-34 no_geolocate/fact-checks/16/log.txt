The claim 'In a press conference on December 9, 2024 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said: 'I will ask Biden to invite me to NATO ... there's no point in talking to Trump.'' is false.
Justification: The claim is not entirely accurate. While Zelenskyy did plan to discuss NATO with Biden, as reported by [The Kyiv Independent](https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-plans-to-discuss-nato-invitation-with-biden-president-said/) and [New Voice Ukraine](https://english.nv.ua/nation/zelenskyy-plans-nato-talks-with-biden-acknowledges-trump-s-current-limits-50472802.html), the specific quote attributed to him is not fully supported by the available evidence. The evidence suggests a similar sentiment, but not the exact quote.

So, the overall veracity is: false
