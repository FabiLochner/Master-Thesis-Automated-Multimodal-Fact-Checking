## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image in question, ![image 21](media/69.jpg), appears in multiple sources. One source is a Wikipedia article about East Slavic names, which includes an image of a Russian internal passport ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Slavic_name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Slavic_name)). Another source is Wikimedia Commons, which shows a Russian passport ([https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Pasport_RF.jpg](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Pasport_RF.jpg)). The third source is a website discussing Russian internal passports ([https://ukrainian-passport.com/blog/internal-russian-passport/](https://ukrainian-passport.com/blog/internal-russian-passport/)), which uses the image as an example.


### Evidence from `web_search`
An AOL article from January 8, 2025, fact-checks the claim that the image shows Bashar al-Assad's Russian passport and states that the image is fake and photoshopped. The original passport image was found on Wikipedia. The Wikipedia article discusses Bashar al-Assad's presidency, including the Russian intervention in 2015, and mentions the 2024 Syrian opposition offensives, which led to Assad fleeing to Moscow and being granted political asylum. The NV.ua article discusses the arrest of relatives of Bashar al-Assad at Beirut airport on December 28, who were attempting to leave using fake passports, and mentions that Bashar Assad's regime had fallen and that he fled Damascus.

The sources are: [https://www.aol.com/fact-check-assad-passport-image-140122086.html](https://www.aol.com/fact-check-assad-passport-image-140122086.html), [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bashar_al-Assad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bashar_al-Assad), and [https://english.nv.ua/nation/relatives-of-bashar-al-assad-arrested-at-beirut-airport-using-fake-passports-50477670.html](https://english.nv.ua/nation/relatives-of-bashar-al-assad-arrested-at-beirut-airport-using-fake-passports-50477670.html). The image ![image 21](media/69.jpg) is not mentioned in the search result.


## Elaboration
The AOL article fact-checks the claim and states that the image is fake and photoshopped. The original passport image was found on Wikipedia. The NV.ua article discusses the arrest of relatives of Bashar al-Assad at Beirut airport on December 28, who were attempting to leave using fake passports.


## Final Judgement
The image is a photoshopped version of a Russian passport. The AOL article fact-checks the claim and states that the image is fake.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image of the Russian passport is a fabrication, as confirmed by an AOL fact-check article ([https://www.aol.com/fact-check-assad-passport-image-140122086.html](https://www.aol.com/fact-check-assad-passport-image-140122086.html)).
