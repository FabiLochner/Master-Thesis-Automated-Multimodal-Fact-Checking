Content: The 2025 London Summit on Ukraine, officially named the Securing Our Future London Summit, was held on March 2, 2025, in London, hosted by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The summit's aim was to create a "coalition of the willing" in Europe to present a peace plan for the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Participants included leaders from 16 states, the EU, and NATO. The summit followed a meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and U.S. President Donald Trump. Outcomes included a four-point plan and commitments from Starmer, including Â£1.6 billion in UK export finances for air defense missiles for Ukraine. The summit also aimed to build strong security guarantees for Ukraine to ensure a lasting ceasefire or peace deal.

The claim '<image:9> This is an authentic image of world leaders taking off their suits to symbolically support Ukraine at the London summit on Ukraine on March 2, 2025.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While the London Summit on Ukraine did occur on March 2, 2025, and was attended by European leaders, including Zelensky, the image search results show that the leaders did not take off their suits, contradicting the claim.

So, the overall veracity is: false
