Content: The search result from Ukrinform.net states that the cover of The Economist featuring Trump and Putin with the headline "Apocalypse" is a fake created by Russian propagandists. The article mentions that the fake cover lacks a publication date, a standard feature of genuine Economist issues. The actual Economist issue published on November 16, 2024, features a globe being struck by a golf club. <image:13776>, <image:13778>, <image:13779>, <image:13781>.

Useful result: From [Source](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/economist-not-published-apocalypse-cover-154559076.html): 
Content: The search result from Yahoo News states that the image is not a genuine cover published by The Economist. The image features Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin with the word ‘apocalypse’ beneath them. The Economist edition for 24 February 2024 did feature a different illustration of President Putin and Mr Trump with the title ‘Is Europe ready?’. The image was shared in a Telegram post on 19 November. <image:13782>, <image:13790>

The claim '<image:2> This image shows a screenshot of an authentic cover of the magazine The Economist from the end of 2024 illustrating Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin and warning of an apocalypse.' is false.
Justification: The image of The Economist cover featuring Trump and Putin with the "APOCALYPSE" headline is a fake, according to fact-checkers like AAP FactCheck ([Source](https://www.aap.com.au/factcheck/fake-economist-apocalypse-cover-linked-to-pro-kremlin-propaganda/)), Ukrinform.net ([Source](https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-factcheck/3930063-russian-propaganda-fabricates-the-economist-cover-about-beginning-of-world-war-iii.html)), and Yahoo News ([Source](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/economist-not-published-apocalypse-cover-154559076.html)). These sources identify the cover as a fabrication, potentially linked to pro-Kremlin propaganda and containing spelling errors.

So, the overall veracity is: false
