Content: Mediazona, in collaboration with Meduza, estimates that by August 2025, around 220,000 Russian men between 18 and 55 had been killed in the war.

The claim 'As of February 2025, Russia has lost 1.5 million troops in the Ukraine war.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While there are varying estimates of Russian casualties in the Ukraine war, none of the provided sources support the claim of 1.5 million troop losses by February 2025. A [Russia Matters report](https://www.russiamatters.org/news/russia-ukraine-war-report-card/russia-ukraine-war-report-card-feb-26-2025) from February 26, 2025, estimates over 700,000 Russian troops killed or injured, and a Mediazona article estimates around 220,000 Russian men killed by August 2025.

So, the overall veracity is: false
