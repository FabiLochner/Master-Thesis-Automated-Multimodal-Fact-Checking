The claim 'Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni condemned the US-Ukrainian bombing of Russia at the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro in November 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While Giorgia Meloni attended the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro in November 2024, evidence indicates she supported Ukraine and called for Russia to end the war, not that she condemned US-Ukrainian actions.

So, the overall veracity is: false
