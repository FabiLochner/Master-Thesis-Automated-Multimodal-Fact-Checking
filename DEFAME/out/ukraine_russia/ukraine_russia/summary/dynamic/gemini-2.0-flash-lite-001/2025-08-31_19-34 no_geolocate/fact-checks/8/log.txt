Useful result: From [Source](https://global.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202203/22/WS62392e6fa310fd2b29e52706.html): 
Content: The Chinese government provided humanitarian aid to Ukraine, including 5 million yuan from the Red Cross Society of China. The Red Cross Society of China provided three batches of humanitarian assistance to Ukraine from March 9 to 14, including food and sleeping bags. The article was published on March 22, 2022.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/china-ukraine-aid-russia-rock-solid-rcna18937): 
Content: NBC News published an article on March 7, 2022, stating that China's Red Cross will provide humanitarian aid to Ukraine "as soon as possible." The article also mentions China's "rock solid" friendship with Russia. <image:6>
The claim '<image:6> This image shows the Chinese Communist Party's Red Cross troops in Russia who have changed into winter clothes and set off for the Russian-Ukrainian front to aid Russia in rescuing its occupied territories.' is false.
Justification: The claim is unsubstantiated. While the Chinese Red Cross provided humanitarian aid to Ukraine in March 2022, there is no evidence to support the assertion that Chinese Red Cross troops were deployed to assist Russia in its war efforts, and the image used in the claim is of an airliner, not of troops.

So, the overall veracity is: false
