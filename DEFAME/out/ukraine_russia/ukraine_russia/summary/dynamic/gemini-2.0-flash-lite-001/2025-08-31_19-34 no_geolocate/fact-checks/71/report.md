## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The IMF website provides information about Russia, including its membership date, quota, and Special Drawing Rights, and includes a link to the July 2025 World Economic Outlook Update, which projects a 0.9% change in real GDP for 2025 (![image 2695](media/2025-08-07_21-00-1754600446-931830.jpg)). The IMF ranks Russia as the world's 4th largest economy in terms of PPP.

The article from russiamatters.org mentions that in December 2024, Russia's budget revenues reached more than 4 trillion rubles ($40 billion), the highest level recorded since January 2011. The article was published on February 06, 2025.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the IMF ranks Russia as the world's 4th largest economy in terms of PPP. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that this ranking was declared in October 2024. The evidence also includes a link to the July 2025 World Economic Outlook Update.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified without additional information confirming the exact date of the IMF's declaration.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The IMF website provides the World Economic Outlook, October 2024, which includes projections and chapters on global prospects and policies, and also provides the World Economic Outlook Update, July 2025. The search result does not explicitly state that the IMF declared Russia the fourth-largest economy in the world in October 2024 (![image 2695](media/2025-08-07_21-00-1754600446-931830.jpg)

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the IMF ranks Russia as the world's 4th largest economy in terms of PPP. However, the search results do not explicitly state that this ranking was declared in October 2024. The IMF's World Economic Outlook, October 2024, is mentioned, but it does not confirm the specific declaration date.

Therefore, the claim's veracity remains uncertain due to the lack of explicit confirmation regarding the date of the IMF's declaration.
