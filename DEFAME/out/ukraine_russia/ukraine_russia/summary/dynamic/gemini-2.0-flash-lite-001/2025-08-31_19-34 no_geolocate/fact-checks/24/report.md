### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-warren-buffett-did-130000882.html): 
Content: The search result from Yahoo News fact-checks the claim that Warren Buffett has given more than $500 million to Ukraine, rating it as "False". ![image 511](media/2025-08-06_17-43-1754502239-987691.jpg) Howard Buffett, Warren Buffett's son, donated more than $800 million to Ukraine since 2022 through his own foundation. The Howard G. Buffett Foundation's total grantmaking in support of mitigating the war's impact on Ukraine will exceed $1 billion by the end of 2025. The foundation spent $510,986,831 in Ukraine since the start of the war, according to its 2023 report.


## Elaboration
The claim is false. While Howard Buffett, Warren Buffett's son, has donated over $500 million to Ukraine through his foundation, the evidence indicates that Warren Buffett himself has not made such a donation. A fact-check from Yahoo News explicitly labels the claim as "False" ([https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-warren-buffett-did-130000882.html](https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-warren-buffett-did-130000882.html)).


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that while Howard Buffett, Warren Buffett's son, has donated over $500 million to Ukraine, the claim that Warren Buffett himself made the donation is false. Multiple sources confirm Howard Buffett's contributions, but not Warren Buffett's.

The most appropriate decision option is `false`.
