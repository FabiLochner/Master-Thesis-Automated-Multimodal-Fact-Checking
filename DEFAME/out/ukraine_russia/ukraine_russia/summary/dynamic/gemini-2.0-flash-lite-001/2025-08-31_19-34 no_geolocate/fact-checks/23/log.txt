Content: The Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) states that since the Russian invasion in February 2022, Ukraine has become the top recipient of U.S. aid. The article mentions that in late 2024, the United States provided the Ukrainian government with a $20 billion loan. The article also mentions that in early March 2025, President Donald Trump froze all military aid to Ukraine and then lifted the freeze shortly after. The article does not specify the exact amount of military aid provided as of February 2025.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.csis.org/analysis/trump-administration-boosts-immediate-military-aid-deliveries-ukraine): 
Content: The search result from CSIS.org, published on February 11, 2025, discusses the Trump administration's military aid to Ukraine. It mentions the administration's announcement of weapons sales to Ukraine totaling $652 million under the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program, adding to the $310 million in FMS approved in May. The policy appears to keep in place the military aid committed under the Biden administration, which is set to deliver around $30 billion over the next three-and-a-half years. <image:503>, <image:502>, <image:501>.

The claim 'As of February 2025, the United States had given $350 billion in military aid to Ukraine for its war with Russia.' is false.
Justification: The claim that the United States had given $350 billion in military aid to Ukraine as of February 2025 is not supported by the evidence. While the U.S. has provided significant aid, sources like [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/08/05/g-s1-81084/europe-us-weapons-ukraine-russia-war) report around $75 billion in military assistance since 2022, and [CSIS](https://www.csis.org/analysis/trump-administration-boosts-immediate-military-aid-deliveries-ukraine) reports on weapons sales totaling $652 million in February 2025.

So, the overall veracity is: false
