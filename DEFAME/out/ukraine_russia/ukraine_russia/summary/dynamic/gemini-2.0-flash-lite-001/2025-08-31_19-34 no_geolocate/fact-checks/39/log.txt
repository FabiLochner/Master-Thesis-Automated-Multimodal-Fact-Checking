Useful result: From [Source](https://www.stopfake.org/en/fake-infowars-journalist-murdered-shortly-after-ukraine-put-him-on-their-kill-list/): 
Content: StopFake.org states that Jamie White was not on any "list of enemies of Ukraine" and that there is no evidence to support the claim. White's sister and law enforcement officials believe his death was unrelated to his journalistic activities. The article includes an image of a screenshot of a tweet by Jamie White, claiming he was on a Ukrainian "Enemies List" <image:13890>. The article also mentions that White spread disinformation and anti-Ukrainian conspiracy theories.

The claim 'After InfoWars reporter Jamie White was shot dead on March 10, 2025 in Austin, Texas, it was revelaed that he was on a Ukranian enemies hit list.' is false.
Justification: The claim that Jamie White was on a Ukrainian hit list is **false**. While White was shot dead in Austin, Texas, on March 10, 2025, there is no evidence to support the claim that he was on a Ukrainian hit list. Sources like Alex Jones suggest this, but this is disputed by [StopFake.org](https://www.stopfake.org/en/fake-infowars-journalist-murdered-shortly-after-ukraine-put-him-on-their-kill-list/), and law enforcement officials believe his death was unrelated to his journalistic activities.

So, the overall veracity is: false
