The articles were published in September 2024.


### Evidence from `web_search`
The web search results discuss Claudia Sheinbaum's statements on drug trafficking and the U.S.'s role in it. One article from workers.org ([Source](https://www.workers.org/2025/02/83990/)) highlights Sheinbaum's emphasis on U.S. responsibility for drug consumption and trafficking. An MSNBC article ([Source](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-mexico-president-claudia-sheinbaum-fentanyl-response-rcna182496)) mentions Sheinbaum's response to Donald Trump's claims about Mexico's role in the fentanyl crisis, stating that Mexico does not consume synthetic drugs.

Mexico News Daily ([Source](https://mexiconewsdaily.com/politics/trump-sheinbaum-us-anti-drug-campaign/)) reports that Donald Trump thanked Claudia Sheinbaum for inspiring the launch of a US anti-drug campaign. ![image 9503](media/2025-08-30_22-10-1756591817-029296.jpg), ![image 9505](media/2025-08-30_22-10-1756591818-360673.jpg), ![image 9516](media/2025-08-30_22-10-1756591848-400985.jpg), ![image 9519](media/2025-08-30_22-11-1756591860-941643.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Claudia Sheinbaum declined an invitation to visit Ukraine. However, the provided search results do not contain any information about the alleged quote attributed to her.

Therefore, the veracity of the second part of the claim cannot be determined based on the available evidence. More information is needed to verify the statement.


## Final Judgement
The claim that Claudia Sheinbaum rejected an invitation to Ukraine is supported by multiple sources. However, the claim includes a quote attributed to her that cannot be verified with the provided evidence. The search results do not contain any information about the alleged quote.

The decision option that best applies is `false`.


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
While it is confirmed that Claudia Sheinbaum declined an invitation to visit Ukraine, there is no evidence to support the second part of the claim, which includes a quote attributed to her. The search results do not contain any information about the alleged quote. Therefore, the claim is considered false.
