## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
According to a Russia Matters report from February 26, 2025, more than 700,000 Russian troops have been killed or injured, with 48,000 missing, based on a January 2025 estimate (![image 1](media/0.jpg)). A Wikipedia article mentions that a British Army official estimated that Russia would incur 1.5 to 1.8 million casualties to control four regions of Ukraine. The article also states that as of July 29, 2025, 5,432 Russian officers had been killed.

Mediazona, in collaboration with BBC News Russian service, provides information on Russian losses, with the last update of the Probate Registry estimate being February 24, 2025, based on data from December 2024.

### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://en.zona.media/article/2025/08/29/casualties_eng-trl): 
Content: Mediazona, in collaboration with Meduza, estimates that by August 2025, around 220,000 Russian men between 18 and 55 had been killed in the war. The article also mentions that in November 2024, male mortality reached a peak of approximately 3,000 deaths per week. The named list of verified losses includes 98,340 cases with a known date of death. The last update to the Probate Registry estimate was August 29, 2025.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the claim is inaccurate. A Russia Matters report from February 26, 2025, estimates over 700,000 Russian troops killed or injured, with 48,000 missing, based on a January 2025 estimate. Additionally, Mediazona, in collaboration with Meduza, estimates around 220,000 Russian men between 18 and 55 had been killed by August 2025. The claim of 1.5 million troop losses by February 2025 is not supported by the provided data.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that the claim of 1.5 million Russian troop losses by February 2025 is not accurate. The provided sources offer different estimates, none of which support the claim.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While there are varying estimates of Russian casualties in the Ukraine war, none of the provided sources support the claim of 1.5 million troop losses by February 2025. A [Russia Matters report](https://www.russiamatters.org/news/russia-ukraine-war-report-card/russia-ukraine-war-report-card-feb-26-2025) from February 26, 2025, estimates over 700,000 Russian troops killed or injured, and a Mediazona article estimates around 220,000 Russian men killed by August 2025.
