## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky signing ammunition at the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant (SCAAP) in Pennsylvania, USA, on September 23, 2024. The BBC published an article on September 26, 2024, discussing the meeting between Zelensky and US President Joe Biden, and mentions Zelensky's visit to the SCAAP. The New York Post also published an article on September 25, 2024, discussing Zelensky's visit to the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant.

The articles do not mention Israeli bombs or Gaza.

### Evidence from `web_search`
The claim that Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed Israeli bombs intended for use against Palestinians in Gaza is false. The image (![image 16](media/49.jpg)) shows Zelenskyy signing artillery shells at a U.S. munitions factory, not Israeli bombs. The video was published in September 2024, and the messages reference Ukraine's war with Russia, not Israel's war in Gaza.

Zelenskyy signed a missile at the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant (SCAAP) in Pennsylvania, along with Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro. Zelenskyy inscribed messages on US bombs, including "Glory to Ukraine." (![image 16](media/49.jpg))


## Elaboration
The claim is false. The image shows Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing artillery shells at the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant (SCAAP) in Pennsylvania, USA, not Israeli bombs. The evidence indicates that the ammunition was intended for use in the war between Ukraine and Russia, not in Gaza.


## Final Judgement
The image shows Zelenskyy signing artillery shells at a U.S. munitions factory, not Israeli bombs. The ammunition was intended for use in the war between Ukraine and Russia, not in Gaza.
