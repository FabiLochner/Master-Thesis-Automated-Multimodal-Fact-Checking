US President Donald Trump is focused on peace and has made unprecedented progress in the negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, US Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard told NDTV in an exclusive conversation today.

Here are the top 10 quotes by Tulsi Gabbard:
--------------------------------------------

1. "Trump remains very committed to combating and defeating the threat of Islamist terrorism. "Trump is also taking action where the previous administration failed. So, President Trump has taken a decisive action for our own safety, security, and prosperity."
    

8. "President Trump is seeing this ongoing conflict with very clear eyes. "Under the previous administration, there was no effort at all towards peace or direct dialogue with Putin to bring an end to this war. So, in a very short period of time, Trump has made much more progress towards peace than any other previous effort. The talks are just beginning between Trump's incoming cabinet and the Bangladesh government, but this continues to remain a central focus area of concern."

Newsweek AI is in beta. So already in a very short period of time, President Trump has made much more progress towards peace than any effort that has occurred by anyone, previously.

"I'm sure that President Trump will have a very productive conversation with Putin, once again, rooted in his unwavering commitment to peace."

In the same interview, **Gabbard** also hailed Trump's relationship with Indian Prime Minister [Narendra Modi](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/narendra-modi)
: "With President Trump's leadership in the United States, of course Prime Minister Modi's longstanding leadership here in India, we have two leaders of our two great countries who are very good friends and who are very focused on how we can strengthen those shared objectives and those shared interests."

What Happens Next
-----------------

Trump and Putin are slated to speak over the phone on Tuesday.

_Correction 3/18/25, 8:43 a.m. ET: This article was updated to delete erroneous Associated Press reporting and clarify comments Tulsi Gabbard made about the relationship between President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi._

_Update 3/17/25, 6:41 p.m. Her visit to India holds special significance: Gabbard, a veteran, was the first Hindu elected to [Congress](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/congress)
 when she served as a representative from Hawaii.

What To Know
------------

Gabbard criticized former President [Joe Biden](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/joe-biden)
's handling of the war in Ukraine and said Trump's push for both sides to agree to a ceasefire comes from an "unwavering commitment to peace."

!Trump and Putin <image:1416>

U.S. That prompted Zelensky to say he was ready to sign a rare earth minerals deal that the Trump administration has pushed for in exchange for continued aid to Ukraine.

Last week, Ukraine agreed to the U.S.'s proposal for a 30-day ceasefire, subject to the Kremlin's agreement.

“Under the previous administration, during which this war began, there was no effort, there was no effort at all towards peace.
