23,"As of February 2025, the United States had given $350 billion in military aid to Ukraine for its war with Russia.",False,False,True,"The claim that the United States had given $350 billion in military aid to Ukraine as of February 2025 is not supported by the evidence. Multiple sources, including the BBC and USAfacts, provide figures for aid allocated and disbursed, none of which reach the claimed amount. The highest figure mentioned is $184.8 billion appropriated as of March 31, 2025, according to the US Department of Defense.
","It's possible to arrive at varying totals depending on how military aid is defined or by considering how much money was allocated — as opposed to actually paid out — by the U.S. government, but none of these totals amounts to $350 billion.
Trump's claim is incorrect. While it is possible to arrive at varying totals using different ways to categorize or count the financial figures, none amounts to $350 billion. As of this writing, the United States had allocated nearly $183 billion for the response to Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, according to the U.S. government's inspector general overseeing the situation. That amount includes more than just what the U.S. government directly sent to Ukraine — and only $83 billion had actually been paid out as of December 2024. Thus, we rate this claim false."
49,<image:16> This image shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing Israeli bombs intended for use against Palestinians in Gaza.,False,False,True,"The claim is false. The image depicts Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing artillery shells at the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant (SCAAP) in Pennsylvania, USA, as confirmed by reverse image searches and news reports ([BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80rkv0k4j8o), [New York Post](https://nypost.com/2024/09/25/opinion/zelenskys-arms-factory-visit-reeks-of-partisan-foreign-election-interference/)). The ammunition was intended for use in the war between Ukraine and Russia, not in Gaza.
","Misbar’s team found that the image shows Zelenskyy signing American bombs produced for Ukraine. A reverse image search led to a YouTube video published by AFP News Agency in September 2024. The video, which included frames similar to the viral image, showed Zelenskyy visiting an ammunition factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania. According to AFP’s description, Zelenskyy visited the United States at the time to seek permission to use Western weapons against targets in Russia. At the 0:56 timestamp, a frame similar to the viral image can be seen."
63,"In an interview with NDTV on March 17, 2025 Director of US National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said that President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin were good friends.",True,False,False,"In an interview with NDTV on March 17, 2025, Tulsi Gabbard, then Director of US National Intelligence, stated that Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin were ""very good friends,"" as reported by U.S. News & World Report ([https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2025-03-17/gabbard-says-trump-is-looking-forward-to-success-ahead-of-talk-with-putin](https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2025-03-17/gabbard-says-trump-is-looking-forward-to-success-ahead-of-talk-with-putin)).
","This claim is false. Gabbard was talking about Modi being friends with Trump, not Putin. She made these remarks during an interview with NDTV. While some outlets reported that she was talking about Trump and Putin, others corrected it. For example, the Associated Press withdrew their story. “The Associated Press has withdrawn its story about U.S. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard saying President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin ‘are very good friends.’ Gabbard was talking about Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The AP will publish a corrected version of the story,” reads the AP’s withdrawal notice. Alexa Henning, the deputy chief of staff for Gabbard, called out the incorrect reporting via a post on X."
