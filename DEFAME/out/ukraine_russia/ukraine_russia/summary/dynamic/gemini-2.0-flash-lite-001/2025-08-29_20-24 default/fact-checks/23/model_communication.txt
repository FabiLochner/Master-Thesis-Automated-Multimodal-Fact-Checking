This has been a familiar dynamic for the administration; in early July, the White House announced it would freeze the delivery of some weapons intended for Ukraine. Dozens of other countries, including most members of the [North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/what-nato "North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)")
 and European Union (EU), are also providing large aid packages to Ukraine.

The Ukrainian government has received most, but not all, of the funding in the five U.S. supplemental appropriations bills passed since the invasion.

A large share of the money in the aid bills has been spent in the United States, paying for American factories and workers to produce the various weapons that are either shipped to Ukraine or that replenish the U.S. cities.

NATO allies are particularly wary of being pulled directly into the hostilities, which could dramatically raise the [risk of a nuclear war](https://www.cfr.org/article/if-russia-goes-nuclear-three-scenarios-ukraine-war "risk of a nuclear war")
. In addition, after widely broadcast friction between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a February 28 Oval Office visit, European nations such as France, Germany, and the United Kingdom have all stepped up pledges of support.

While much is unclear about the new policy, it appears NATO member states will send weapons from their stockpiles to Ukraine and buy U.S. Separately, the Trump administration this week announced weapons sales to Ukraine totaling $652 million under the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program, adding to the $310 million in FMS approved in May. The Trump administration policy appears to keep in place the military aid committed under the Biden administration, which is set to deliver around $30 billion over the next three-and-a-half years.

The visit of Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to the White House for talks aimed at ending the war has put the scale of United States (US) support for Ukraine under the spotlight again.

President Donald Trump has criticised the amount of aid provided by the US compared to Europe in the past. But the figures he's previously cited are not backed by the evidence.

BBC Verify has been taking a close look at how much the US has spent since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and how it compares with Europe's contribution.

How much has the US spent in total?
-----------------------------------

The US has spent a total of $130.6bn (£98.9bn) between 24 January 2022 and 30 June 2025, [according to the Kiel Institute](https://www.ifw-kiel.de/publications/ukraine-support-tracker-data-20758/)
, a Germany-based think tank that tracks international support for Ukraine.

The US Department of Defense has provided its own figure looking at all spending on Operation Atlantic Resolve - [a response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0l0k4389g2o)
.

It says [$184.8bn has been "appropriated"](https://www.ukraineoversight.gov/Funding/)
 - a figure that covers US military training in Europe and replenishment of US defence stocks.

This total runs only to 31 March 2025, making it less up to date than the Kiel Institute's calculation - though notably higher.

BBC Verify has asked the US departments of Defense and State if they can supply more recent figures.

What has Trump previously claimed?
----------------------------------

Back in February, when he was hosting France's President Macron, Trump claimed:

"We've spent more than $300bn and Europe has spent about $100bn - that's a big difference"

! It includes military, financial and humanitarian aid.

Will Europe get its money back while the United States doesn't?
---------------------------------------------------------------

Trump has previously claimed Europe would get its money back as it was "loaning" it to Ukraine.

This prompted Macron - who was sat next to the US president in their Oval Office meeting in February - to intervene, saying both Europe and the US had given a mixture of grants and loans.

President Macron is correct, according to Kiel figures specifically on financial aid. But the institute's figures also suggest President Trump has a point - the US has sent more grants, while the EU sent more loans.

However, again, there are different figures out there.

As of 18 July, [the EU says its members have provided about $180bn so far](https://www.eeas.europa.eu/delegations/united-states-america/eu-assistance-ukraine-us-dollars_en?s=253)
, with loans making up 35% of the total.

Like the United States Department of Defense, the EU has used a broader definition of what counts as aid to Ukraine.

EU loans will have been on generous terms - so Ukraine will be repaying less interest than it would normally. But Europe combined has spent more money than the US, according to the Kiel Institute.

Between January 2022 and the end of June 2025, Europe as a whole spent $165.7bn on Ukraine, compared to the US's $130.6bn over the same period, according to Kiel Institute calculations.

The figure includes aid directly from the European Union (EU), but also from bilateral deals from European countries, both inside and outside the EU. In some cases, Ukraine isn't expected to pay anything, with repayments coming from revenues from frozen Russian assets.

What we can say is that aid to Ukraine has been [a mixture of loans and grants](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20241017IPR24736/parliament-approves-up-to-EU35-billion-loan-to-ukraine-backed-by-russian-assets)
.

How much has the UK given to Ukraine
------------------------------------

The UK is one of the biggest individual state donors to Ukraine - the latest was a $2.8bn (£2.3bn) loan agreement signed during Zelensky's visit to London on 1 March.

At the end of July, [the UK government had committed $29.5bn (£21.8bn) for Ukraine overall](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-support-to-ukraine-factsheet/uk-support-to-ukraine-factsheet)

How much has the US given to Ukraine?

BBC Verify looked at the claim at the time and [concluded Trump's numbers did not add up](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/videos/cddy92025gdo)
 as the published numbers - from both Kiel and the US government - showed the US had spent a lot less than $300bn.

This remains the case six months on.

How does US spending compare to Europe?
---------------------------------------

It is true that the US is, by some margin, the largest single donor to Ukraine. This includes $17.6bn (£13bn) in military support.

The only countries to have spent more are the United States and Germany, according to Kiel data.

However, the UK's contributions are much smaller than the US

That raises a question for the UK and other European countries: if peace is not secured in the near future and US decides to withdraw a large part of its funding, can other states make up the difference?

That would require a significant increase in their current contributions.

 to send Ukraine $45.8 billion in equipment, more than one quarter the aid total.

Most of US aid to Ukraine has been security assistance.
-------------------------------------------------------

### **How much economic and humanitarian assistance has the US provided Ukraine?**

Economic governance and development support accounts for another 24% of aid, or $44.2 billion. According to OAR, services in Ukrainian cities have improved overall since 2024, leaving fewer people in need of humanitarian assistance, but have worsened in regions close to the Russian border, where humanitarian aid is still required.

Another 2% of the aid budget has been allocated to operations for the agencies involved in coordinating the effort, including oversight on spending.

**How much of the total federal budget has gone towards Ukraine response?**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The federal government spent [$20.1 trillion](https://usafacts.org/answers/how-much-does-the-us-federal-government-spend/country/united-states/)
 from fiscal years 2022 to 2024, so the $182.8 billion in Ukraine allocations would amount to less than 1% of the budget.

In 2024, the most recent complete fiscal year, $66.9 billion was allocated. For context, the total budget of the [Federal Highway Administration](https://usafacts.org/explainers/what-does-the-us-government-do/agency/us-department-of-transportation/)
 in FY 2024 was $61.1 billion.

### **Will Ukraine have to pay the US back?**

A portion of the military aid will have to be repaid, though the US has yet to establish a definitive timeline.

In May 2022, President Biden signed the [Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3025302/biden-signs-lend-lease-act-to-supply-more-security-assistance-to-ukraine/)
, authorizing the US military to provide Ukraine and other Eastern European countries with equipment as a loan. When Congress allocates funding, it specifies amounts to different US agencies based on their functions.

Of emergency aid for Ukraine since 2022, Congress has allocated:

*   68% ($123.9 billion) to the [Department of Defense](https://usafacts.org/explainers/what-does-the-us-government-do/agency/us-department-of-defense/)
     (DOD)
*   22% ($39.9 billion) to the [US Agency for International Development](https://usafacts.org/explainers/what-does-the-us-government-do/agency/us-agency-for-international-development/)
     (USAID)
*   6% ($11.6 billion) to the [State Department](https://usafacts.org/explainers/what-does-the-us-government-do/agency/us-department-of-state/)
    
*   4% ($7.4 billion) to other agencies including the International Development Finance Corporation, [Department of Health and Human Services](https://usafacts.org/explainers/what-does-the-us-government-do/agency/us-department-of-health-and-human-services/)
    , [Treasury](https://usafacts.org/explainers/what-does-the-us-government-do/agency/us-department-of-the-treasury/)
    , and [Department of Energy](https://usafacts.org/explainers/what-does-the-us-government-do/agency/us-department-of-energy/)
    

Congress has allocated $182.8 billion to Ukraine response since 2022.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Those agencies commit some or all those funds by awarding contracts to beneficiaries in Ukraine and the region. Those funds are paid over time, and they can expire —when Congress allocates funds, it can choose to specify a timeline.

Of the $182.8 billion allocated since the invasion, $140.5 billion has been committed, $83.4 billion has been spent, and $2.7 billion has expired and won’t be paid out.

45.6% of the $182.8 billion allocated to Ukraine response since 2022 has been spent.

**What types of aid are there?**
--------------------------------

All foreign aid responding to the invasion of Ukraine fits in one of four categories: security assistance, economic aid for governance and development, humanitarian aid, and operations.

### **How much security assistance has the US provided Ukraine?**

Security assistance accounts for 71% of all Ukranian allocations since 2022, totaling $130.7 billion. The law requires repayment but defers repayments from Ukraine indefinitely — they’re not required to start paying immediately but they will have to at some point, with interest.

This is not an uncommon aid approach: the [Lend-Lease Act](https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/lend-lease-act)
 supported the United Kingdom, Soviet Union, France, China, and other allies during World War II, providing military equipment but suspending payments during the conflict.

._

! But “allocated” means the money is available, not that it’s been spent: So far, the United States has actually disbursed $83.4 billion in funding and equipment, some of which Ukraine will have to repay with added interest.

Aid for Ukraine goes through a cross-agency operation called [Operation Atlantic Resolve (OAR)](https://media.defense.gov/2025/Feb/13/2003646507/-1/-1/1/OAR_Q1_DEC2024_FINAL_508_2.PDF)
, which began after Russia invaded Crimea in 2014 to deter Russian aggression against [NATO](https://usafacts.org/articles/what-is-nato-and-what-does-it-cost-to-be-a-member/)
. When Russia invaded Ukraine, the operation shifted focus to address the needs of Ukraine and other partners.

**How does foreign aid allocation work?**
-----------------------------------------

The funding allocated for Ukraine supports Ukraine, American partners affected by the war, and US national security programs. Much of this goes straight to the Ukrainian government for anti-corruption programs, [pursuing justice for Russian crimes against Ukrainians](https://media.defense.gov/2025/Feb/13/2003646507/-1/-1/1/OAR_Q1_DEC2024_FINAL_508_2.PDF)
, repairs to damaged energy and agriculture infrastructure, and to fund health and education services, among other initiatives.

The US has allocated 2% of funding to address what OAR leadership calls a “significant humanitarian crisis” caused by the war, including humanitarian support within Ukraine (administered mostly by [USAID](https://usafacts.org/explainers/what-does-the-us-government-do/agency/us-agency-for-international-development/)
) and for refugees across the region (administered mostly by the State Department). How much money has the US given Ukraine since Russia’s invasion?
================================================================

Since February 2022, the United States has allocated $182.8 billion in emergency funding to support Ukraine and the region.

Updated March 14, 2025 by the [USAFacts team](/editorial-guidelines/)

The NPR article from August 5, 2025, states that the U.S. has provided around $75 billion in military assistance to Ukraine since Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022.

The claim states that the US had given $350 billion in military aid to Ukraine as of February 2025. The evidence does not support this claim. The highest amount mentioned is $184.8 billion appropriated as of March 31, 2025.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Council on Foreign Relations states that Ukraine has become the top recipient of U.S. aid since the Russian invasion in February 2022. In late 2024, the United States provided Ukraine with a $20 billion loan. President Trump froze military aid to Ukraine in early March 2025, and then lifted the freeze shortly after. The article does not mention the total amount of military aid provided to Ukraine as of February 2025. [Source](https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-us-aid-going-ukraine)

NPR reported on August 5, 2025, that the U.S. has provided around $75 billion in military assistance to Ukraine since Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022 <image:494>, <image:496>, <image:497>. The CSIS published an article on February 11, 2025, discussing the Trump administration's boost to military aid deliveries to Ukraine <image:503>, <image:502>, <image:501>. The article mentions weapons sales to Ukraine totaling $652 million under the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program, adding to the $310 million in FMS approved in May. The Trump administration policy appears to keep in place the military aid committed under the Biden administration, which is set to deliver around $30 billion over the next three-and-a-half years.

### Evidence from `web_search`
The BBC published an article on November 15, 2024, stating that the US has spent a total of $130.6 billion between January 24, 2022, and June 30, 2025, according to the Kiel Institute. The US Department of Defense says $184.8 billion has been "appropriated" as of March 31, 2025. <image:3178>, <image:3180>, <image:3182>

According to USAfacts, the United States has allocated $182.8 billion in emergency funding to support Ukraine and the region since February 2022. Security assistance accounts for 71% of all Ukranian allocations since 2022, totaling $130.7 billion. As of December 2024, the US has disbursed $83.4 billion in funding and equipment. The article was updated on March 14, 2025.


## Elaboration
The evidence provides conflicting information. One source states that the US had allocated $182.8 billion in emergency funding since February 2022, with $130.7 billion in security assistance as of March 14, 2025. Another source states that the US Department of Defense says $184.8 billion has been "appropriated" as of March 31, 2025. The NPR article from August 5, 2025, states that the U.S. has provided around $75 billion in military assistance to Ukraine since Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022.

The claim states that the US had given $350 billion in military aid to Ukraine as of February 2025. The evidence does not support this claim. The highest amount mentioned is $184.8 billion appropriated as of March 31, 2025.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that the total amount of military aid provided by the United States to Ukraine as of February 2025 was significantly less than $350 billion. The provided sources offer different figures, but none reach the amount stated in the claim.

`false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim that the United States had given $350 billion in military aid to Ukraine as of February 2025 is not supported by the evidence. Multiple sources, including the BBC and USAfacts, provide figures for aid allocated and disbursed, none of which reach the claimed amount. The highest figure mentioned is $184.8 billion appropriated as of March 31, 2025, according to the US Department of Defense.
