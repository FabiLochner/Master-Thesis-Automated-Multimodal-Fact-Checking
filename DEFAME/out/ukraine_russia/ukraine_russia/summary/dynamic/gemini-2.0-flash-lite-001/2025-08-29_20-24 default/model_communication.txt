US President Donald Trump is focused on peace and has made unprecedented progress in the negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, US Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard told NDTV in an exclusive conversation today.

Here are the top 10 quotes by Tulsi Gabbard:
--------------------------------------------

1. "Trump remains very committed to combating and defeating the threat of Islamist terrorism. "Trump is also taking action where the previous administration failed. So, President Trump has taken a decisive action for our own safety, security, and prosperity."
    

8. "President Trump is seeing this ongoing conflict with very clear eyes. "Under the previous administration, there was no effort at all towards peace or direct dialogue with Putin to bring an end to this war. So, in a very short period of time, Trump has made much more progress towards peace than any other previous effort. The talks are just beginning between Trump's incoming cabinet and the Bangladesh government, but this continues to remain a central focus area of concern."

Current political and economic issues succinctly explained.

_Sign up to receive CFR President Mike Froman’s analysis on the most important foreign policy story of the week, delivered to your inbox every Friday. commitment has been called into question in 2025, with President Donald Trump freezing all military aid to Ukraine in early March, and then lifting the freeze shortly after, following cease-fire talks in Saudi Arabia.

This has been a familiar dynamic for the administration; in early July, the White House announced it would freeze the delivery of some weapons intended for Ukraine. Dozens of other countries, including most members of the [North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/what-nato "North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)")
 and European Union (EU), are also providing large aid packages to Ukraine.

In late 2024, the United States also provided the Ukrainian government with a $20 billion loan, funded by interest generated from frozen Russian assets.

It’s important to note that of the total U.S. activities associated with the war in Ukraine, and a small portion has supported other affected countries in the region.

The Ukrainian government has received most, but not all, of the funding in the five U.S. supplemental appropriations bills passed since the invasion.

A large share of the money in the aid bills has been spent in the United States, paying for American factories and workers to produce the various weapons that are either shipped to Ukraine or that replenish the U.S. cities.

The $128 billion figure counts committed aid, much of which has yet to be delivered, according to an [analysis](https://www.csis.org/analysis/ukraine-now-doomed "analysis")
 by the Center for Strategic and International Studies.**\***

Why has the United States provided aid to Ukraine?
--------------------------------------------------

Much of the U.S. Many Western analysts say the military aid provided by the United States and other allies has played a pivotal role in Ukraine’s defense and counteroffensive against Russia. Military Support for Taiwan: Five Charts](https://www.cfr.org/article/us-military-support-taiwan-five-charts)

What weapons and equipment has the United States sent Ukraine?
--------------------------------------------------------------

NATO allies are particularly wary of being pulled directly into the hostilities, which could dramatically raise the [risk of a nuclear war](https://www.cfr.org/article/if-russia-goes-nuclear-three-scenarios-ukraine-war "risk of a nuclear war")
. In addition, after widely broadcast friction between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a February 28 Oval Office visit, European nations such as France, Germany, and the United Kingdom have all stepped up pledges of support. 

For nearly three years of war, the United States has provided or agreed to provide Ukraine with a long list of defense capabilities."

Volodymyr Zelensky (left) and Joe Biden said they would focus on Ukraine's "victory plan" at their White House talks

Volodymyr Zelensky is meeting Joe Biden and Kamala Harris at the White House to discuss his "victory plan", which the Ukrainian president hopes will pressure Russia into agreeing a diplomatic end to the war.

Details have been kept secret, but Zelensky is likely to ask the US president and vice-president for continuing military and financial support, as well as security guarantees.

It comes amid a row with Donald Trump and the Republican party ahead of November's US presidential election.

They were angered by Zelensky's visit to an arms factory in Biden's hometown of Scranton with top Democrats. Zelensky will meet Trump on Friday despite earlier reports that the meeting had been cancelled.

Zelensky's visit to the ammunition factory in the key swing state of Pennsylvania was labelled by leading Republicans as a partisan campaign event.

In a public letter, speaker of the US House Mike Johnson said the visit was "designed to help Democrats" and claimed it amounted to "election interference".

He also demanded that Ukraine fire its ambassador to Washington who helped arrange the visit.

The Republican-led House Oversight Committee has also announced it would investigate whether Zelensky's trip was an attempt to use a foreign leader to benefit Harris's campaign.

Her Republican rival for the presidency, Donald Trump, mocked Zelensky at a campaign event as the "greatest salesman on Earth" and accused him of refusing to "make a deal" with Moscow.

Earlier this week, Trump also praised Russia's military capabilities, saying: "They beat Hitler, they beat Napoleon - that’s what they do, they fight."

The two men have long had a fractious relationship. In 2019, Trump was impeached by the US House over accusations that he pressured Ukraine's leader to dig up damaging information on a political rival.

The row clouded a week in which Zelensky has twice addressed the United Nations, ramping up efforts to persuade the US and other allies to boost support more than two and a half years into Russia's full-scale invasion.

At the White House meetings, Zelensky is expected to push again for US backing to fire Western-made long-range missiles deep into Russian territory, which Biden has so far blocked.

Before the meeting, Biden said: "Let me be clear, Russia will not prevail in war... Ukraine will prevail".

He also pledged to support Kyiv "in its path to membership to both the EU and Nato".

Meanwhile, Zelensky thanked the US for its "unwavering bipartisan support".

He later met Harris, with the vice-president reiterating her support for Ukraine and arguing the US must continue its role of global leadership.

With Russian troops advancing in the east of Ukraine, the outcome of Zelensky's meeting with Biden and Harris is seen by many experts as a key moment in his attempt to shore up US support before the November election.

On Wednesday, Russia's Vladimir Putin announced a plan to revise Moscow's nuclear doctrine, to enable Russia to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states if they are supported by nuclear states.

Putin's spokesperson later clarified that it was meant as a "specific signal" to the West.

President Volodymyr Zelensky visited the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant alongside top Democrats on Friday

Hours before his meeting with Zelensky, Biden announced a $7.9bn (£5.9bn) package of military assistance to Ukraine.

The aid, part of a $61bn package that passed Congress in April, will be approved through presidential drawdown authority and will pull from existing Pentagon supplies to deliver the arms more quickly.

Congressional Republicans blocked the package for months earlier this year, before ultimately relenting and passing the legislation. The delay caused arms supplies to Ukraine to dry up for several months.

Zelensky thanked the US - Ukraine's largest foreign donor.

At the same time, he also reportedly expressed frustration at the delay in delivering weapons that were already promised when he met US congressmen on Thursday morning.

Newsweek AI is in beta. So already in a very short period of time, President Trump has made much more progress towards peace than any effort that has occurred by anyone, previously.

"I'm sure that President Trump will have a very productive conversation with Putin, once again, rooted in his unwavering commitment to peace."

In the same interview, **Gabbard** also hailed Trump's relationship with Indian Prime Minister [Narendra Modi](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/narendra-modi)
: "With President Trump's leadership in the United States, of course Prime Minister Modi's longstanding leadership here in India, we have two leaders of our two great countries who are very good friends and who are very focused on how we can strengthen those shared objectives and those shared interests."

What To Know

U.S. That prompted Zelensky to say he was ready to sign a rare earth minerals deal that the Trump administration has pushed for in exchange for continued aid to Ukraine.

FILE - Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard listens to President Donald Trump during her swearing-in at the Oval Office of the White House, Feb. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, speaking ahead of an expected phone conversation Tuesday between [President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin](https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-vladimir-putin-ukraine-russia-b86c7230a3d9df6a76ed0a064ec3402a)
, said Monday that while the negotiations to end Russia's war with Ukraine have just begun, Trump is “looking forward to success.”

Gabbard criticized former President Joe Biden’s handling of the [war in Ukraine](https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine)
 and said Trump’s push for both sides to agree to a ceasefire comes from an “unwavering commitment to peace.”

“Under the previous administration, during which this war began, there was no effort, there was no effort at all towards peace. So already in a very short period of time, President Trump has made much more progress towards peace than any effort that has occurred by anyone, previously,” Gabbard said in an interview with India's NDTV. Her trip also includes stops in Japan and Thailand.

In the interview with NDTV, Gabbard hailed the relationship between Trump and Indian [Prime Minister Narendra Modi](https://apnews.com/hub/narendra-modi)
 and said both leaders are committed to strengthening ties between their countries.

“With President Trump’s leadership in the United States, of course Prime Minister Modi’s longstanding leadership here in India, we have two leaders of our two great countries who are very good friends and who are very focused on how we can strengthen those shared objectives and those shared interests.”

**Volodymyr Zelensky is meeting Joe Biden and Kamala Harris at the White House to discuss his "victory plan", which the Ukrainian president hopes will pressure Russia into agreeing a diplomatic end to the war.**

Details have been kept secret, but Zelensky is likely to ask the US president and vice-president for continuing military and financial support, as well as security guarantees.

It comes amid a row with Donald Trump and the Republican party ahead of November's US presidential election.

They were angered by Zelensky's visit to an arms factory in Biden's hometown of Scranton with top Democrats. Zelensky will meet Trump on Friday despite earlier reports that the meeting had been cancelled.

Zelensky's visit to the ammunition factory in the key swing state of Pennsylvania was labelled by leading Republicans as a partisan campaign event.

In a public letter, speaker of the US House Mike Johnson said the visit was "designed to help Democrats" and claimed it amounted to "election interference".

He also demanded that Ukraine fire its ambassador to Washington who helped arrange the visit.

The Republican-led House Oversight Committee has also announced it would investigate whether Zelensky's trip was an attempt to use a foreign leader to benefit Harris's campaign.

Her Republican rival for the presidency, Donald Trump, mocked Zelensky at a campaign event as the "greatest salesman on Earth" and accused him of refusing to "make a deal" with Moscow.

Earlier this week, Trump also praised Russia's military capabilities, saying: "They beat Hitler, they beat Napoleon - that’s what they do, they fight."

The two men have long had a fractious relationship. In 2019, Trump was impeached by the US House over accusations that he pressured Ukraine's leader to dig up damaging information on a political rival.

The row clouded a week in which Zelensky has twice addressed the United Nations, ramping up efforts to persuade the US and other allies to boost support more than two and a half years into Russia's full-scale invasion.

At the White House meetings, Zelensky is expected to push again for US backing to fire Western-made long-range missiles deep into Russian territory, which Biden has so far blocked.

Before the meeting, Biden said: "Let me be clear, Russia will not prevail in war... Ukraine will prevail".

He also pledged to support Kyiv "in its path to membership to both the EU and Nato".

Meanwhile, Zelensky thanked the US for its "unwavering bipartisan support".

He later met Harris, with the vice-president reiterating her support for Ukraine and arguing the US must continue its role of global leadership.

With Russian troops advancing in the east of Ukraine, the outcome of Zelensky's meeting with Biden and Harris is seen by many experts as a key moment in his attempt to shore up US support before the November election.

On Wednesday, Russia's Vladimir Putin announced a plan to revise Moscow's nuclear doctrine, to enable Russia to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states if they are supported by nuclear states.

Putin's spokesperson later clarified that it was meant as a "specific signal" to the West.

Hours before his meeting with Zelensky, Biden announced a $7.9bn (£5.9bn) package of military assistance to Ukraine.

The aid, part of a $61bn package that passed Congress in April, will be approved through presidential drawdown authority and will pull from existing Pentagon supplies to deliver the arms more quickly.

Congressional Republicans blocked the package for months earlier this year, before ultimately relenting and passing the legislation. The delay caused arms supplies to Ukraine to dry up for several months.

Zelensky thanked the US - Ukraine's largest foreign donor.

At the same time, he also reportedly expressed frustration at the delay in delivering weapons that were already promised when he met US congressmen on Thursday morning.

Critical Questions by Mark F. While much is unclear about the new policy, it appears NATO member states will send weapons from their stockpiles to Ukraine and buy U.S. Separately, the Trump administration this week announced weapons sales to Ukraine totaling $652 million under the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program, adding to the $310 million in FMS approved in May. The Trump administration policy appears to keep in place the military aid committed under the Biden administration, which is set to deliver around $30 billion over the next three-and-a-half years.

What was [Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky](https://nypost.com/2024/09/25/us-news/house-gop-accuses-kamala-harris-of-using-zelensky-as-campaign-surrogate-launches-foreign-interference-inquiry/)
 doing at what sure _looked_ like a partisan US political event this week?

And how did the White House let this happen?

Zelensky got flown into battleground Pennsylvania aboard a USAF C-17 plane on Tuesday; he then toured the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant accompanied by Gov. Josh Shapiro, Sen. Bob Casey, Rep. Matt Cartwright — the last two being active Democratic candidates.

And it looks like no GOP candidates got invited — trapping a foreign head of state into apparently taking sides in US domestic politics.

Yet Zelensky was guarded by Secret Service agents and driven around in Secret Service vehicles, adding more reek of impropriety: Who covered those expenses?

Someone in the Biden administration pulled a fast one: Pennsylvania has a fair number of anti-Russian Polish-Americans and others of Eastern European heritage who might be swayed by Zelensky’s seeming preference.

Legalities aside, this is terrible for Zelensky: Ukraine desperately needs support from Republicans as well as Democrats in Congress, and will no matter who holds the White House next year.

House Speaker Mike Johnson is calling on Zelensky to fire his US ambassador for letting this disgrace happen, a move that could mend _Ukraine’s_ fences here.

But Congress will need answers on the American side, too: After all, Democrats impeached President Donald Trump over _his_ supposed abuses linked to Ukraine; now we have the misuse of a foreign guest’s visit to influence US politics.

We absolutely endorse US support of Kyiv against Moscow’s brutal invasion: Vladimir Putin must not succeed.

And Democratic candidates have every right to slam those Republicans who want to hang Ukraine out to dry.

But dragging any foreign leader, _especially_ one who’s seeking now new support for his nation from the White House, into US politics is morally criminal — at least.

Whether at the White House or the State Department, _American_ heads need to roll over this."

The visit of Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to the White House for talks aimed at ending the war has put the scale of United States (US) support for Ukraine under the spotlight again.

President Donald Trump has criticised the amount of aid provided by the US compared to Europe in the past. But the figures he's previously cited are not backed by the evidence.

BBC Verify has been taking a close look at how much the US has spent since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and how it compares with Europe's contribution.

How much has the US spent in total?
-----------------------------------

The US has spent a total of $130.6bn (£98.9bn) between 24 January 2022 and 30 June 2025, [according to the Kiel Institute](https://www.ifw-kiel.de/publications/ukraine-support-tracker-data-20758/)
, a Germany-based think tank that tracks international support for Ukraine.

The US Department of Defense has provided its own figure looking at all spending on Operation Atlantic Resolve - [a response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0l0k4389g2o)
.

It says [$184.8bn has been "appropriated"](https://www.ukraineoversight.gov/Funding/)
 - a figure that covers US military training in Europe and replenishment of US defence stocks.

This total runs only to 31 March 2025, making it less up to date than the Kiel Institute's calculation - though notably higher.

BBC Verify has asked the US departments of Defense and State if they can supply more recent figures.

What has Trump previously claimed?
----------------------------------

Back in February, when he was hosting France's President Macron, Trump claimed:

"We've spent more than $300bn and Europe has spent about $100bn - that's a big difference"

! It includes military, financial and humanitarian aid.

Will Europe get its money back while the United States doesn't?
---------------------------------------------------------------

Trump has previously claimed Europe would get its money back as it was "loaning" it to Ukraine.

This prompted Macron - who was sat next to the US president in their Oval Office meeting in February - to intervene, saying both Europe and the US had given a mixture of grants and loans.

President Macron is correct, according to Kiel figures specifically on financial aid. But the institute's figures also suggest President Trump has a point - the US has sent more grants, while the EU sent more loans.

However, again, there are different figures out there.

As of 18 July, [the EU says its members have provided about $180bn so far](https://www.eeas.europa.eu/delegations/united-states-america/eu-assistance-ukraine-us-dollars_en?s=253)
, with loans making up 35% of the total.

Like the United States Department of Defense, the EU has used a broader definition of what counts as aid to Ukraine.

EU loans will have been on generous terms - so Ukraine will be repaying less interest than it would normally. But Europe combined has spent more money than the US, according to the Kiel Institute.

Between January 2022 and the end of June 2025, Europe as a whole spent $165.7bn on Ukraine, compared to the US's $130.6bn over the same period, according to Kiel Institute calculations.

The figure includes aid directly from the European Union (EU), but also from bilateral deals from European countries, both inside and outside the EU. In some cases, Ukraine isn't expected to pay anything, with repayments coming from revenues from frozen Russian assets.

What we can say is that aid to Ukraine has been [a mixture of loans and grants](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20241017IPR24736/parliament-approves-up-to-EU35-billion-loan-to-ukraine-backed-by-russian-assets)
.

How much has the UK given to Ukraine
------------------------------------

The UK is one of the biggest individual state donors to Ukraine - the latest was a $2.8bn (£2.3bn) loan agreement signed during Zelensky's visit to London on 1 March.

At the end of July, [the UK government had committed $29.5bn (£21.8bn) for Ukraine overall](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-support-to-ukraine-factsheet/uk-support-to-ukraine-factsheet)

BBC Verify looked at the claim at the time and [concluded Trump's numbers did not add up](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/videos/cddy92025gdo)
 as the published numbers - from both Kiel and the US government - showed the US had spent a lot less than $300bn.

This remains the case six months on.

How does US spending compare to Europe?
---------------------------------------

It is true that the US is, by some margin, the largest single donor to Ukraine. This includes $17.6bn (£13bn) in military support.

The only countries to have spent more are the United States and Germany, according to Kiel data.

However, the UK's contributions are much smaller than the US

That raises a question for the UK and other European countries: if peace is not secured in the near future and US decides to withdraw a large part of its funding, can other states make up the difference?

That would require a significant increase in their current contributions.

 to send Ukraine $45.8 billion in equipment, more than one quarter the aid total.

Most of US aid to Ukraine has been security assistance.

### **How much economic and humanitarian assistance has the US provided Ukraine?**

Economic governance and development support accounts for another 24% of aid, or $44.2 billion. According to OAR, services in Ukrainian cities have improved overall since 2024, leaving fewer people in need of humanitarian assistance, but have worsened in regions close to the Russian border, where humanitarian aid is still required.

Another 2% of the aid budget has been allocated to operations for the agencies involved in coordinating the effort, including oversight on spending.

**How much of the total federal budget has gone towards Ukraine response?**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The federal government spent [$20.1 trillion](https://usafacts.org/answers/how-much-does-the-us-federal-government-spend/country/united-states/)
 from fiscal years 2022 to 2024, so the $182.8 billion in Ukraine allocations would amount to less than 1% of the budget.

In 2024, the most recent complete fiscal year, $66.9 billion was allocated. For context, the total budget of the [Federal Highway Administration](https://usafacts.org/explainers/what-does-the-us-government-do/agency/us-department-of-transportation/)
 in FY 2024 was $61.1 billion.

### **Will Ukraine have to pay the US back?**

A portion of the military aid will have to be repaid, though the US has yet to establish a definitive timeline.

In May 2022, President Biden signed the [Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3025302/biden-signs-lend-lease-act-to-supply-more-security-assistance-to-ukraine/)
, authorizing the US military to provide Ukraine and other Eastern European countries with equipment as a loan. When Congress allocates funding, it specifies amounts to different US agencies based on their functions.

Of emergency aid for Ukraine since 2022, Congress has allocated:

*   68% ($123.9 billion) to the [Department of Defense](https://usafacts.org/explainers/what-does-the-us-government-do/agency/us-department-of-defense/)
     (DOD)
*   22% ($39.9 billion) to the [US Agency for International Development](https://usafacts.org/explainers/what-does-the-us-government-do/agency/us-agency-for-international-development/)
     (USAID)
*   6% ($11.6 billion) to the [State Department](https://usafacts.org/explainers/what-does-the-us-government-do/agency/us-department-of-state/)
    
*   4% ($7.4 billion) to other agencies including the International Development Finance Corporation, [Department of Health and Human Services](https://usafacts.org/explainers/what-does-the-us-government-do/agency/us-department-of-health-and-human-services/)
    , [Treasury](https://usafacts.org/explainers/what-does-the-us-government-do/agency/us-department-of-the-treasury/)
    , and [Department of Energy](https://usafacts.org/explainers/what-does-the-us-government-do/agency/us-department-of-energy/)
    

Congress has allocated $182.8 billion to Ukraine response since 2022.

Those agencies commit some or all those funds by awarding contracts to beneficiaries in Ukraine and the region. Those funds are paid over time, and they can expire —when Congress allocates funds, it can choose to specify a timeline.

Of the $182.8 billion allocated since the invasion, $140.5 billion has been committed, $83.4 billion has been spent, and $2.7 billion has expired and won’t be paid out.

45.6% of the $182.8 billion allocated to Ukraine response since 2022 has been spent.

**What types of aid are there?**
--------------------------------

All foreign aid responding to the invasion of Ukraine fits in one of four categories: security assistance, economic aid for governance and development, humanitarian aid, and operations.

### **How much security assistance has the US provided Ukraine?**

Security assistance accounts for 71% of all Ukranian allocations since 2022, totaling $130.7 billion. The law requires repayment but defers repayments from Ukraine indefinitely — they’re not required to start paying immediately but they will have to at some point, with interest.

This is not an uncommon aid approach: the [Lend-Lease Act](https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/lend-lease-act)
 supported the United Kingdom, Soviet Union, France, China, and other allies during World War II, providing military equipment but suspending payments during the conflict.

._

! But “allocated” means the money is available, not that it’s been spent: So far, the United States has actually disbursed $83.4 billion in funding and equipment, some of which Ukraine will have to repay with added interest.

Aid for Ukraine goes through a cross-agency operation called [Operation Atlantic Resolve (OAR)](https://media.defense.gov/2025/Feb/13/2003646507/-1/-1/1/OAR_Q1_DEC2024_FINAL_508_2.PDF)
, which began after Russia invaded Crimea in 2014 to deter Russian aggression against [NATO](https://usafacts.org/articles/what-is-nato-and-what-does-it-cost-to-be-a-member/)
. When Russia invaded Ukraine, the operation shifted focus to address the needs of Ukraine and other partners.

**How does foreign aid allocation work?**
-----------------------------------------

The funding allocated for Ukraine supports Ukraine, American partners affected by the war, and US national security programs. Much of this goes straight to the Ukrainian government for anti-corruption programs, [pursuing justice for Russian crimes against Ukrainians](https://media.defense.gov/2025/Feb/13/2003646507/-1/-1/1/OAR_Q1_DEC2024_FINAL_508_2.PDF)
, repairs to damaged energy and agriculture infrastructure, and to fund health and education services, among other initiatives.

The US has allocated 2% of funding to address what OAR leadership calls a “significant humanitarian crisis” caused by the war, including humanitarian support within Ukraine (administered mostly by [USAID](https://usafacts.org/explainers/what-does-the-us-government-do/agency/us-agency-for-international-development/)
) and for refugees across the region (administered mostly by the State Department). How much money has the US given Ukraine since Russia’s invasion?
================================================================

### **CLAIM**

Posts claimed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed artillery shells destined to be dropped on Gaza during a visit to a Pennsylvania munitions factory.

* * *

### **BACKGROUND**

A video and still images shared online were described as showing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing artillery shells destined for use in Gaza by Israel.

One [version](https://x.com/firasshams1/status/1896565304148574479)
 of video was circulated online at the beginning of March with the caption: “For those feeling sorry for Volodymyr Zelensky, here’s the Ukrainian President signing bombs to be dropped on innocent Gazans”. Zelensky signing bombs that killed Palestinian women and children”.

* * *

### **METHOD**

The video of Zelenskyy and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro signing artillery shells began to circulate online following an eventful meeting at the White House between Zelenskyy, President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance on February 28 which turned into a near-shouting match.

 \[Accessed 13 Mar. During the meeting, Trump told Zelenskyy to make a deal with Russia to end the war in Ukraine. He also told Zelenskyy he was “[gambling with World War III](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/28/trump-vance-zelenskyy-oval-office-exchange-00206727)
”.

A reverse Google Image search of a screen shot from the video however revealed that it was published several months before the fateful White House meeting.

Governor Josh Shapiro shared the video on September 23, 2024, with a caption referencing Ukraine’s war with Russia. This version allowed us to see that Zelenskyy wrote “Glory to Ukraine” on one shell and “Thanks for Support” on another, both referencing Ukraine’s war with Russia and not Israel’s war in Gaza.

[Information](https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/prezident-vidvidav-skrentonskij-armijskij-boyepripasnij-zavo-93389)
 about Zelenskyy’s visit to the ammunition factory, as well as details on its operations, was provided on Ukraine’s official government website.

“The plant’s capacity is fully dedicated to meeting Ukraine’s needs, particularly for the production of 155mm shells, which has significantly increased over the past year,” the statement read.

A statement regarding the visit was also released on the U.S. Army [website](https://www.army.mil/article/279911/ukrainian_president_zelenskyy_tours_scranton_army_ammunition_plant)
 which confirmed the factory was being used to bolster Ukraine’s ammunition stockpile.

* * *

### **RATING**

The video shows Zelenskyy visiting a munitions factory that produces armaments for the Ukrainian Security and Defense Forces, not Israel. It was published five months before the February 2025 meeting and a longer version of the video reveals that Zelenskyy’s handwritten messages do not reference Ukraine’s war with Russia or Israel’s war in Gaza. Available at: [For those feeling sorry for Volodymyr Zelensky](https://x.com/firasshams1/status/1896565304148574479)

## Claim
Claim: "In an interview with NDTV on March 17, 2025 Director of US National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said that President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin were good friends."

## Actions
```
web_search("Tulsi Gabbard NDTV interview March 17 2025 Trump Putin")

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
NDTV interviewed Tulsi Gabbard, where she discussed Donald Trump's focus on peace and progress in negotiations between Russia and Ukraine ([https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/trump-focused-on-peace-tulsi-gabbard-on-russia-ukraine-war-7941806](https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/trump-focused-on-peace-tulsi-gabbard-on-russia-ukraine-war-7941806)). Newsweek reported that Gabbard said Trump was "looking forward to success" ahead of a phone call with Putin, and also criticized the Biden administration's handling of the Russia-Ukraine war ([https://www.newsweek.com/tulsi-gabbard-shares-details-trumps-relationship-putin-2046181](https://www.newsweek.com/tulsi-gabbard-shares-details-trumps-relationship-putin-2046181)) <image:1416>.

U.S. News & World Report also reported that Gabbard said Trump and Putin "are very good friends" in an interview with NDTV ([https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2025-03-17/gabbard-says-trump-is-looking-forward-to-success-ahead-of-talk-with-putin](https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2025-03-17/gabbard-says-trump-is-looking-forward-to-success-ahead-of-talk-with-putin)) <image:i>.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Tulsi Gabbard was interviewed by NDTV on March 17, 2025. U.S. News & World Report states that Gabbard said Trump and Putin "are very good friends" in the NDTV interview ([https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2025-03-17/gabbard-says-trump-is-looking-forward-to-success-ahead-of-talk-with-putin](https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2025-03-17/gabbard-says-trump-is-looking-forward-to-success-ahead-of-talk-with-putin)).

Therefore, the claim is supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that Tulsi Gabbard stated that Trump and Putin were good friends in an interview with NDTV on March 17, 2025.

`true`

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence provides conflicting information. One source states that the US had allocated $182.8 billion in emergency funding since February 2022, with $130.7 billion in security assistance as of March 14, 2025. Another source states that the US Department of Defense says $184.8 billion has been "appropriated" as of March 31, 2025. The NPR article from August 5, 2025, states that the U.S. has provided around $75 billion in military assistance to Ukraine since Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022.

The claim states that the US had given $350 billion in military aid to Ukraine as of February 2025. The evidence does not support this claim. The highest amount mentioned is $184.8 billion appropriated as of March 31, 2025.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.

The Council on Foreign Relations states that Ukraine has become the top recipient of U.S. aid since the Russian invasion in February 2022. In late 2024, the United States provided Ukraine with a $20 billion loan. President Trump froze military aid to Ukraine in early March 2025, and then lifted the freeze shortly after. The article does not mention the total amount of military aid provided to Ukraine as of February 2025. [Source](https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-us-aid-going-ukraine)

NPR reported on August 5, 2025, that the U.S. has provided around $75 billion in military assistance to Ukraine since Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022 <image:494>, <image:496>, <image:497>. The CSIS published an article on February 11, 2025, discussing the Trump administration's boost to military aid deliveries to Ukraine <image:503>, <image:502>, <image:501>. The article mentions weapons sales to Ukraine totaling $652 million under the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program, adding to the $310 million in FMS approved in May.

### Evidence from `web_search`
The BBC published an article on November 15, 2024, stating that the US has spent a total of $130.6 billion between January 24, 2022, and June 30, 2025, according to the Kiel Institute. The US Department of Defense says $184.8 billion has been "appropriated" as of March 31, 2025. <image:3178>, <image:3180>, <image:3182>

According to USAfacts, the United States has allocated $182.8 billion in emergency funding to support Ukraine and the region since February 2022. Security assistance accounts for 71% of all Ukranian allocations since 2022, totaling $130.7 billion. As of December 2024, the US has disbursed $83.4 billion in funding and equipment. The article was updated on March 14, 2025.


## Elaboration
The evidence provides conflicting information. One source states that the US had allocated $182.8 billion in emergency funding since February 2022, with $130.7 billion in security assistance as of March 14, 2025. Another source states that the US Department of Defense says $184.8 billion has been "appropriated" as of March 31, 2025. The NPR article from August 5, 2025, states that the U.S. has provided around $75 billion in military assistance to Ukraine since Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022.

The claim states that the US had given $350 billion in military aid to Ukraine as of February 2025. The evidence does not support this claim. The highest amount mentioned is $184.8 billion appropriated as of March 31, 2025.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that the total amount of military aid provided by the United States to Ukraine as of February 2025 was significantly less than $350 billion. The provided sources offer different figures, but none reach the amount stated in the claim.

"Zelenskyy just essentially endorsed Kamala in Pennsylvania while with Josh Shapiro autographing ammunition," wrote Philadelphia commentator Joey Mannarino on X.

"He called Trump and Vance ‘radical’. – locked in a tight re-election race with businessman David McCormick – was seen shaking hands with Zelenskyy as Shapiro wrote a message on the missile.

In an official statement, Shapiro said Pennsylvania is the "birthplace of American freedom" and Pennsylvanians therefore stand with Ukrainians in their fight against "naked aggression."

He also noted Pennsylvania will sign an agreement with the Ukrainian state of Zaporizhizhia that will "foster collaboration for years to come."

15 October 2024 18:57

**Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's recent visit to Pennsylvania has stirred significant controversy, raising questions about the intersection of foreign diplomacy and US electoral politics.** 

During a tour aimed at bolstering support for Ukraine, Zelenskyy made headlines after signing munitions at the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant, a move that has elicited mixed reactions from both local residents and political leaders, **[Caliber.Az](https://caliber.az/en)

While at the plant, Zelenskyy inscribed messages of gratitude on US bombs, including the phrase “Glory to Ukraine.” Democratic Governor Josh Shapiro, who was present during the signing, appeared supportive of the gesture. “Because you’re signing bombs that could potentially kill innocent people.

The backlash against Zelenskyy’s visit was further amplified by political commentators and Republican leaders. Reports indicate that Zelenskyy’s remarks about the Republican candidate for US vice president, whom he labeled as radical, only fueled this perception.

Senator Lindsey Graham, a prominent Republican figure, also condemned Zelenskyy's presence at the military plant, asserting that such actions could jeopardize Ukraine’s long-term objectives in its fight against Russia. “We need to ensure that incidents like this do not detract from the long-term goals of ensuring success for Ukraine,” Graham remarked.

### Evidence from `web_search`
The claim that Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed Israeli bombs intended for use against Palestinians in Gaza is false. The image (<image:16>) shows Zelenskyy signing artillery shells at a U.S. munitions factory, not Israeli bombs. The video was published in September 2024, and the messages reference Ukraine's war with Russia, not Israel's war in Gaza.

Zelenskyy signed a missile at the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant (SCAAP) in Pennsylvania, along with Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro. Zelenskyy inscribed messages on US bombs, including "Glory to Ukraine." (<image:16>)


## Elaboration
The claim is false. The image shows Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing artillery shells at the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant (SCAAP) in Pennsylvania, USA, not Israeli bombs. The evidence indicates that the ammunition was intended for use in the war between Ukraine and Russia, not in Gaza.


## Final Judgement
The image shows Zelenskyy signing artillery shells at a U.S. munitions factory, not Israeli bombs. The ammunition was intended for use in the war between Ukraine and Russia, not in Gaza.
