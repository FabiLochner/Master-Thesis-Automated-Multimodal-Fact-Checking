## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Council on Foreign Relations states that Ukraine has become the top recipient of U.S. aid since the Russian invasion in February 2022. In late 2024, the United States provided Ukraine with a $20 billion loan. President Trump froze military aid to Ukraine in early March 2025, and then lifted the freeze shortly after. The article does not mention the total amount of military aid provided to Ukraine as of February 2025. [Source](https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-us-aid-going-ukraine)

NPR reported on August 5, 2025, that the U.S. has provided around $75 billion in military assistance to Ukraine since Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022 ![image 494](media/2025-08-06_17-42-1754502171-020535.jpg), ![image 496](media/2025-08-06_17-42-1754502173-562939.jpg), ![image 497](media/2025-08-06_17-42-1754502174-952586.jpg). The CSIS published an article on February 11, 2025, discussing the Trump administration's boost to military aid deliveries to Ukraine ![image 503](media/2025-08-06_17-43-1754502186-411462.jpg), ![image 502](media/2025-08-06_17-43-1754502185-652269.jpg), ![image 501](media/2025-08-06_17-43-1754502184-885543.jpg). The article mentions weapons sales to Ukraine totaling $652 million under the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program, adding to the $310 million in FMS approved in May. The Trump administration policy appears to keep in place the military aid committed under the Biden administration, which is set to deliver around $30 billion over the next three-and-a-half years.

### Evidence from `web_search`
The BBC published an article on November 15, 2024, stating that the US has spent a total of $130.6 billion between January 24, 2022, and June 30, 2025, according to the Kiel Institute. The US Department of Defense says $184.8 billion has been "appropriated" as of March 31, 2025. ![image 3178](media/2025-08-22_09-05-1755853512-728986.jpg), ![image 3180](media/2025-08-22_09-05-1755853514-364342.jpg), ![image 3182](media/2025-08-22_09-05-1755853515-997065.jpg)

According to USAfacts, the United States has allocated $182.8 billion in emergency funding to support Ukraine and the region since February 2022. Security assistance accounts for 71% of all Ukranian allocations since 2022, totaling $130.7 billion. As of December 2024, the US has disbursed $83.4 billion in funding and equipment. The article was updated on March 14, 2025.


## Elaboration
The evidence provides conflicting information. One source states that the US had allocated $182.8 billion in emergency funding since February 2022, with $130.7 billion in security assistance as of March 14, 2025. Another source states that the US Department of Defense says $184.8 billion has been "appropriated" as of March 31, 2025. The NPR article from August 5, 2025, states that the U.S. has provided around $75 billion in military assistance to Ukraine since Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022.

The claim states that the US had given $350 billion in military aid to Ukraine as of February 2025. The evidence does not support this claim. The highest amount mentioned is $184.8 billion appropriated as of March 31, 2025.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that the total amount of military aid provided by the United States to Ukraine as of February 2025 was significantly less than $350 billion. The provided sources offer different figures, but none reach the amount stated in the claim.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim that the United States had given $350 billion in military aid to Ukraine as of February 2025 is not supported by the evidence. Multiple sources, including the BBC and USAfacts, provide figures for aid allocated and disbursed, none of which reach the claimed amount. The highest figure mentioned is $184.8 billion appropriated as of March 31, 2025, according to the US Department of Defense.
