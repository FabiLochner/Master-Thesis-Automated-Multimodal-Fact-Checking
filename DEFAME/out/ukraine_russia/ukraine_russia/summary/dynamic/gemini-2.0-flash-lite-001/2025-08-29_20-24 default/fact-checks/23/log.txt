Content: The Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) states that since the Russian invasion in February 2022, Ukraine has become the top recipient of U.S. aid. The article mentions that in late 2024, the United States provided the Ukrainian government with a $20 billion loan. The article also mentions that President Donald Trump froze all military aid to Ukraine in early March 2025, and then lifted the freeze shortly after. The article does not mention the total amount of military aid provided to Ukraine as of February 2025.

Content: The CSIS published an article on February 11, 2025, discussing the Trump administration's boost to military aid deliveries to Ukraine. <image:503>, <image:502>, <image:501>. The article mentions the administration's announcement of weapons sales to Ukraine totaling $652 million under the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program, adding to the $310 million in FMS approved in May. The Trump administration policy appears to keep in place the military aid committed under the Biden administration, which is set to deliver around $30 billion over the next three-and-a-half years.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crew8y7pwd5o): 
Content: The BBC published an article on November 15, 2024, discussing the amount of military aid the US has given to Ukraine. According to the Kiel Institute, the US has spent a total of $130.6 billion between January 24, 2022, and June 30, 2025. The US Department of Defense says $184.8 billion has been "appropriated" as of March 31, 2025. <image:3178>, <image:3180>, <image:3182>.

Useful result: From [Source](https://usafacts.org/articles/how-much-money-has-the-us-given-ukraine-since-russias-invasion/): 
Content: The United States has allocated $182.8 billion in emergency funding to support Ukraine and the region since February 2022. Security assistance accounts for 71% of all Ukranian allocations since 2022, totaling $130.7 billion. As of December 2024, the US has disbursed $83.4 billion in funding and equipment. The article was updated on March 14, 2025, by the USAfacts team.

The claim 'As of February 2025, the United States had given $350 billion in military aid to Ukraine for its war with Russia.' is false.
Justification: The claim that the United States had given $350 billion in military aid to Ukraine as of February 2025 is not supported by the evidence. Multiple sources, including the BBC and USAfacts, provide figures for aid allocated and disbursed, none of which reach the claimed amount. The highest figure mentioned is $184.8 billion appropriated as of March 31, 2025, according to the US Department of Defense.

So, the overall veracity is: false
