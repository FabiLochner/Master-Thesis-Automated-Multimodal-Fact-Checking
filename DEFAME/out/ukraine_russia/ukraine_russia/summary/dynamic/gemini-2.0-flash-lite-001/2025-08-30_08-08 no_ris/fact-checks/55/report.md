Several news outlets, including the BBC ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0m12wl0jwpo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0m12wl0jwpo)) and The Hollywood Reporter ([https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/politics-news/fake-online-usaid-paid-hollywood-stars-debunked-1236129713/](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/politics-news/fake-online-usaid-paid-hollywood-stars-debunked-1236129713/)), debunked a video alleging that USAID paid Hollywood celebrities to visit Ukraine. The BBC identified the video as part of a Russian disinformation campaign.

E! News' parent company, NBCUniversal, also dismissed the claim.

The evidence from multiple reliable sources directly contradicts the claim. Therefore, the most appropriate decision option is `false`.
