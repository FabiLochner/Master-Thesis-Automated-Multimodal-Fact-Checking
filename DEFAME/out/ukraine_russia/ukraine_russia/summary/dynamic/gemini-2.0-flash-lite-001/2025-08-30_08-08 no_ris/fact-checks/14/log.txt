Content: The DW article fact-checks a claim that a Fox News article reported that USAID pays $140 million per month to Ukraine's Psychological and Information Warfare Center. The article states that a manipulated screenshot of a Fox News article is circulating on social media. The article states that USAID's share was approximately $39.9 billion, with the bulk allocated to humanitarian aid, governance programs, and public service support, and there was no mention of a $140-million-per-month disbursement to a "Psychological and Information Warfare Center." The article also mentions that the "psychological operations unit" is part of its Special Operations Forces (SOF). <image:11>
