Content: CNN reports that a Ukrainian F-16 pilot was killed and his jet crashed after a large Russian aerial assault on June 29, 2025. The pilot, 1st Class Lt.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/ukraine-says-one-of-its-f-16-jets-donated-by-the-west-crashed-during-russian-missile-attack): 
Content: PBS NewsHour, published on August 29, 2024, reports that an F-16 jet donated by Western partners crashed during a Russian missile attack. The crash was the first reported loss of an F-16 in Ukraine. The article mentions that four Russian missiles were shot down by F-16s. The pilot died. <image:8024>

The claim '<image:5> This image shows a US F-16 fighter jet which was shot down in August 2024 in airspace over the Black Sea after refusing to obey Russian orders.' is false.
Justification: The claim is unsubstantiated. While there are reports of F-16 crashes, including one during a Russian missile attack in August 2024, none of the provided evidence supports the claim that an F-16 was shot down over the Black Sea after refusing Russian orders. The evidence includes reports from [Defense News](https://www.defensenews.com/global/europe/2024/08/29/ukraine-f-16-jet-crashes-during-russian-attack-killing-pilot/), [PBS NewsHour](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/ukraine-receives-first-f-16-fighter-jets-from-western-allies), and [Yahoo News](https://www.yahoo.com/news/f-16-crashes-during-airshow-150000777.html), but none of these sources corroborate the specific details of the claim.

So, the overall veracity is: false
