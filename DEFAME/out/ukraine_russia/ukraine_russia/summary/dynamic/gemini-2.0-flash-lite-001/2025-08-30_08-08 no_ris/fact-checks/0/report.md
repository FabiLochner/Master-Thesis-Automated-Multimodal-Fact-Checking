## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results include a listing from penrithcity.spydus.com about the Hull Daily Mail from March 13, 2025, and a fact-check from mythdetector.com, published on March 17, 2025, which identifies the image as a falsified Hull Daily Mail cover ![image 66](media/2025-08-06_17-26-1754501162-718406.jpg). The fabricated cover, dated March 13, 2025, claims that 70,000 Ukrainian soldiers died in vain in the Kursk region. The actual March 13 issue of the Hull Daily Mail does not mention Ukraine. The search results also include a listing from Magzter showing the Hull Daily Mail from March 13, 2025 ![image 73](media/2025-08-06_17-26-1754501202-576951.jpg). The front page of the newspaper includes the headline "BOY FOUND GUILTY OF ATTEMPTING TO MURDER GIRL WITH A SWORD".

### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources debunk a fake Hull Daily Mail front page from March 13, 2025, which claimed that 70,000 Ukrainian soldiers died in the Kursk region. The article from Gwara Media ([https://gwaramedia.com/en/debunking-russian-fakes-hull-daily-mail-didnt-write-about-70000-ukrainian-soldiers-killed-in-russias-kursk-oblast/](https://gwaramedia.com/en/debunking-russian-fakes-hull-daily-mail-didnt-write-about-70000-ukrainian-soldiers-killed-in-russias-kursk-oblast/)) and The Journal.ie ([https://www.thejournal.ie/ukraine-hull-daily-mail-debunk-6657051-Mar2025/](https://www.thejournal.ie/ukraine-hull-daily-mail-debunk-6657051-Mar2025/)) confirm the headline was fake and that the real front page featured a different story. ![image 1451](media/2025-08-07_13-39-1754573946-256635.jpg), ![image 1452](media/2025-08-07_13-39-1754573949-807201.jpg), ![image 1454](media/2025-08-07_13-39-1754573951-547510.jpg), ![image 1471](media/2025-08-07_13-41-1754574072-732356.jpg)

The real front page from March 13, 2025, had a different headline. ![image 1](media/0.jpg)


## Elaboration
The claim is false. The provided image is a fabricated front page of the Hull Daily Mail. The actual front page of the Hull Daily Mail from March 13, 2025, did not contain the headline about Ukrainian soldiers.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that the image is a fabricated front page of the Hull Daily Mail. The real front page from March 13, 2025, featured a different headline. Therefore, the claim is not factually accurate. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification

The real front page from March 13, 2025, did not contain the headline about Ukrainian soldiers, as evidenced by the actual front page found via web search.
