Useful result: From [Source](https://disinfo.detector.media/en/post/blackrock-allegedly-owns-47-of-ukraines-territory-and-has-banned-ukraine-from-burying-its-military): 
Content: Detector Media states that propagandists falsely claim BlackRock owns 47% of Ukraine's territory and asked not to bury soldiers on its land. The press service of the President of Ukraine said that in late 2022, Volodymyr Zelenskyi met with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink to discuss projects for the country's recovery. In 2023, the Ukrainian government signed an agreement with BlackRock and JPMorgan to create a fund to attract private investment to restore the Ukrainian economy, but this did not include restrictions on burying the military.

The claim 'BlackRock has asked that Ukrainian soldiers not be buried on the land it owns in Ukraine.' is false.
Justification: The claim that BlackRock requested Ukrainian soldiers not be buried on its land in Ukraine is false. Fact-checks by the Asia Fact Check Lab ([Source](https://www.rfa.org/english/news/afcl/afcl-blackrock-ukraine-land-08262024030948.html)) and Myth Detector ([Source](https://mythdetector.com/en/ukrainian-lands-and-banned-the-burial-of-military-personnel/)) show the claim originated from a Bulgarian politician and a satirical Telegram channel, and was spread by Russian and Chinese media.
