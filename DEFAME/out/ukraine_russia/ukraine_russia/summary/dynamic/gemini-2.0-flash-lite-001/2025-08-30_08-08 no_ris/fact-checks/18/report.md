## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
In November 2024, Nikita Zhuravel was sentenced to 14 years in prison. Reuters reports that he was sentenced to 14 years for treason in a separate case from his previous conviction for burning a Quran (![image 1874](media/2025-08-07_19-13-1754594007-532509.jpg)). The Moscow Times states that he received an additional 13 years and six months for treason, with a previous sentence of 3.5 years for burning the Quran, totaling 14 years (![image 1879](media/2025-08-07_19-13-1754594012-123543.jpg)). Meduza also reports that Zhuravel received an additional 13.5 years for treason, resulting in a total of 14 years.

## Elaboration
The claim is partially accurate. In November 2024, Nikita Zhuravel was sentenced to 14 years in prison. However, the Reuters report indicates that the 14-year sentence was for treason, a separate case from his previous conviction for burning the Quran. The Moscow Times and Meduza confirm that the 14-year sentence is a result of an additional sentence for treason, combined with the previous sentence for burning the Quran.


## Final Judgement
The claim is partially true. While Nikita Zhuravel was sentenced to 14 years in November 2024, the sentence was for treason, not directly for burning the Quran, although the burning of the Quran was a separate conviction.

### Verdict: TRUE

### Justification
In November 2024, Nikita Zhuravel was sentenced to 14 years in prison. However, the sentence was for treason, as reported by [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-man-jailed-burning-koran-sentenced-14-years-separate-ukraine-treason-2024-11-25/), [The Moscow Times](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2024/11/25/russian-man-jailed-for-quran-burning-sentenced-to-135-more-years-in-prison-for-treason-a87123), and [Meduza](https://meduza.io/en/news/2024/11/26/man-beaten-in-police-custody-for-burning-quran-gets-13-5-years-for-treason-against-russia-in-separate-case). The 14-year sentence is a result of an additional sentence for treason, combined with the previous sentence for burning the Quran.
