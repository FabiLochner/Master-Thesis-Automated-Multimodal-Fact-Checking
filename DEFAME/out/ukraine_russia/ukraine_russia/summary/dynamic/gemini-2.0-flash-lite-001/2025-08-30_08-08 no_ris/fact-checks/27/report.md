## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
VOA News published an article discussing Russian propaganda that falsely portrays Zelenskyy as a supervillain, including claims about him buying yachts and preparing to flee to the U.S. Investigative journalists and fact-checkers have debunked these claims. ([https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-propaganda-portrays-zelenskyy-as-supervillain-/7808285.html](https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-propaganda-portrays-zelenskyy-as-supervillain-/7808285.html)) ![image 8141](media/2025-08-30_08-18-1756541926-455281.jpg)

Detector Media reports that a fake news story claimed Zelenskyy bought a $35 million residence in Florida, which was denied by Check Your Fact.

### Evidence from `web_search`
According to Myth Detector, Zelenskyy's income decreased after the war began, and his family's financial situation was affected by the temporary suspension of rental income from real estate. Forbes estimates Zelenskyy's net worth to be less than $30 million. The article debunks claims about Zelenskyy purchasing expensive properties.

An article from AOL states that Zelenskyy's net worth is roughly $1.5 million, not $1.5 billion. His annual salary as Ukrainian president is approximately $11,200. Zelenskyy's 2018 financial disclosure listed total assets worth 37 million hryvnias.

## Elaboration
The evidence contradicts the claim. Multiple sources debunk the claim that Zelenskyy owns a $35 million home in Florida, with some sources explicitly stating he does not own property there. Furthermore, the evidence indicates that Zelenskyy's net worth is significantly less than $1.2 billion. One source estimates his net worth to be less than $30 million, while another states it is approximately $1.5 million.

The evidence also contradicts the claim about Zelenskyy's monthly income. One source states his annual salary is approximately $11,200, which is far less than the claimed $11 million monthly income. The evidence does not mention the number of homes or private planes owned by Zelenskyy, but it does debunk claims about expensive property purchases.

In conclusion, the evidence strongly suggests that the claim is false, as it exaggerates Zelenskyy's wealth and property ownership.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that the claim is false. Multiple sources debunk the assertions about Zelenskyy's property ownership, including a $35 million home in Florida, and his financial assets, such as a $1.2 billion overseas bank account and a monthly income of $11 million. The evidence indicates that his actual net worth and income are significantly lower.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. Multiple sources, including VOA News ([https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-propaganda-portrays-zelenskyy-as-supervillain-/7808285.html](https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-propaganda-portrays-zelenskyy-as-supervillain-/7808285.html)), debunk the assertions about Zelenskyy's property ownership and financial assets. His net worth is estimated to be significantly less than the claimed $1.2 billion, and his income is also much lower than stated.
