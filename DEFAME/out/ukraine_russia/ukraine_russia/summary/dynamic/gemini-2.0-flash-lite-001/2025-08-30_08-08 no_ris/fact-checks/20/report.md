Additionally, there was a summit between Trump and Putin, with Rutte commenting on the war in Ukraine.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Euronews published an article on November 20, 2024, stating that Mark Rutte did not threaten to expel the US from NATO, despite a social media claim alleging he made such a threat if Trump surrendered Ukraine to Putin (<image:0>). Detector Media reported that Russian sources spread disinformation claiming Rutte threatened to expel the US from NATO, but no authoritative publication reported such threats.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that there were claims circulating on social media and in Russian sources alleging that Mark Rutte threatened to expel the US from NATO if Trump surrendered Ukraine to Putin. However, the evidence explicitly states that Rutte did not make such a threat. Therefore, the claim is false.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that while there were claims and disinformation suggesting Mark Rutte threatened to expel the US from NATO if Trump surrendered Ukraine to Putin, there is no evidence to support this. The search results explicitly state that Rutte did not make such a threat.

The claim is demonstrably false as it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE
