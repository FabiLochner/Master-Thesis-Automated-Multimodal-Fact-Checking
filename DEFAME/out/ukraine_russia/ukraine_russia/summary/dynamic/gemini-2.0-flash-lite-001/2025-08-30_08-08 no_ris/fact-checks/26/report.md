## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The provided sources describe a contentious meeting between Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trump at the White House on February 28, 2025. According to a Wikipedia article, the meeting involved Donald Trump, JD Vance, and Volodymyr Zelenskyy. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Trump%E2%80%93Zelenskyy_Oval_Office_meeting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Trump%E2%80%93Zelenskyy_Oval_Office_meeting)) <image:i>. NPR reported that the visit ended abruptly after an "Oval Office spat" and that Zelenskyy was there to finalize a deal on minerals. ([https://www.npr.org/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5312076/zelenskyys-visit-to-the-white-house-ends-abruptly-after-oval-office-spat](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5312076/zelenskyys-visit-to-the-white-house-ends-abruptly-after-oval-office-spat)) ![image 517](media/2025-08-06_17-46-1754502406-548910.jpg).

Al Jazeera also covered the meeting, highlighting disagreements over a deal for Ukraine's rare earth minerals and security assurances.

### Evidence from `web_search`
Fact-checkers from Yahoo News ([Source](https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-zelenskyy-saying-us-120000537.html)) and CNN ([Source](https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/02/politics/fact-check-zelensky-americans-fighting-ukraine-video)) state that Zelenskyy did not say the U.S. would have to send their sons and daughters to die for Ukraine. VOA News also published an article with the same conclusion ([Source](https://www.voanews.com/a/no-zelenskyy-did-not-say-american-sons-and-daughters-will-have-to-die-in-ukraine/6993247.html)).

The remarks were made two years before the alleged February 2025 White House visit. Zelenskyy was discussing a hypothetical scenario where the loss of Ukraine could lead to a broader conflict involving the U.S. ![image 1](media/0.jpg), <image:k>, ![image 522](media/2025-08-06_17-47-1754502436-263202.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Zelenskyy did not make the statement attributed to him in the claim. Fact-checkers from Yahoo News, CNN, and VOA News have all refuted the claim that Zelenskyy said the U.S. would have to send their sons and daughters to die for Ukraine. The evidence also shows that the alleged statement was made two years before the White House meeting.


## Final Judgement
The claim is demonstrably false. Fact-checkers have debunked the statement attributed to Zelenskyy. The statement was made two years before the alleged White House meeting.

`false`
