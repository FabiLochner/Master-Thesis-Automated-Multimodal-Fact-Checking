Content: Euronews published an article on January 3, 2025, stating that Charlie Hebdo did not publish an issue with Zelenskyy as a caricature. <image:8283>

The claim '<image:14> This image shows a screenshot of an authentic Charlie Hebdo magazine cover from March 20, 2025 illustrating Ukrainian President Volodoymr Zelenskyy lying in a coffin and saying 'Ukraine is an independet state' in French.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. Multiple sources, including Myth Detector and Euronews, confirm that the Charlie Hebdo cover depicting Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a coffin is fabricated and was not published by the magazine.

So, the overall veracity is: false
