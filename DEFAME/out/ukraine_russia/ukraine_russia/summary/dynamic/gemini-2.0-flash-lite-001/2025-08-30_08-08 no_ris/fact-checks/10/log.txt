Useful result: From [Source](https://mythdetector.com/en/disinformation-as-of-the-children-s-hospital-in-kyiv-was-damaged-by-a-ukrainian-air-defense-missile/): 
Content: Myth Detector published on July 10, 2024, an article about the attack on the Okhmatdyt children’s hospital in Kyiv. The article states that on July 8, Russia launched a missile attack on Ukraine, including the hospital. The article mentions that the head of the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission stated that the attack was most likely the result of a direct attack by the Russian side. The article also mentions that Kremlin sources denied responsibility for the attack and claimed that the hospital was hit by a Ukrainian air defense missile. <image:8079>.

The claim '<image:8> This image shows fake children's toys that were photoshopped into the image by the Ukrainian Government after Kyiv's pediatric hospital was attacked by Russian cruise missiles on July 8, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim that the toys in the image of the Kyiv pediatric hospital attack were photoshopped is not supported by the evidence. While the attack on the hospital on July 8, 2024, is confirmed by multiple sources, including the [PBS NewsHour](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/russian-missile-attack-hits-ukrainian-childrens-hospital-amid-bombardment-dozens-killed) and the [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/08/ukraine-horror-russian-bombing-kyiv-childrens-hospital), there is no definitive proof to verify the claim. Pro-Russian sources have alleged the image is fake, specifically regarding the toys, but this does not constitute proof.

So, the overall veracity is: false
