The claim '<image:9> This is an authentic image of world leaders taking off their suits to symbolically support Ukraine at the London summit on Ukraine on March 2, 2025.' is false.
Justification: The claim that European leaders took off their suits to support Ukraine at the London summit on March 2, 2025, is false. While the summit did occur, as confirmed by sources like [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/uks-starmer-tries-revive-hope-ukraine-peace-summit-2025-03-01/), [Le Monde](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/03/02/zelensky-joins-european-leaders-at-key-ukraine-summit-in-london_6738729_4.html), and [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/2/european-leaders-gather-in-london-to-strengthen-support-for-ukraine), images from the summit show leaders wearing suits, not removing them.

So, the overall veracity is: false
