### Evidence from `web_search`
Several sources discuss a new Ukrainian law passed in August 2024 that bans religious organizations with ties to the Russian Orthodox Church. Human Rights Watch published an article on October 30, 2024, discussing the law, which could effectively ban congregations of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (<image:k>). The European Parliament also discussed the ban in a document published on October 10, 2024, mentioning concerns from the UN, Pope Francis, and others regarding potential violations of religious freedom and human rights. The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace published an article on September 4, 2024, stating that the law's main target is the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate (UOCMP) (![image 8150](media/2025-08-30_08-19-1756541995-209494.jpg)).
