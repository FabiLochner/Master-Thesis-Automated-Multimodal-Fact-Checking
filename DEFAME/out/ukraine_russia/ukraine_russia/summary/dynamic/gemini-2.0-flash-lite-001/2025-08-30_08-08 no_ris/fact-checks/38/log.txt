The claim 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy engaged in election interference by campaigning in Pennsylvania for Kamala Harris ahead of the US presidential election in 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited a munitions factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and met with Kamala Harris, there is no evidence to suggest that he was campaigning for her or engaging in election interference. News reports indicate that Zelenskyy's visit was focused on thanking the workforce and emphasizing the partnership between Ukraine and the U.S. [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/volodymyr-zelensky-jd-vance-campaign-kamala-harris-2024-election-2038060) and [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/zelenskyys-meeting-harris-spat-trump-reveal-growing-partisan-divide-uk-rcna172648) reported on the visit and the political interpretations of it.

So, the overall veracity is: false
