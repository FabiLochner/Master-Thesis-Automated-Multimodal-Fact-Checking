On December 28, 2024, Yahya Sare’e, the spokesperson for the Houthis, [announced](https://x.com/AmeenHa2024yan/status/1873057956704731540)
 that a Houthi surface-to-air missile shot down a US MQ-9 Reaper unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) overflying the Al Bayda governorate in Yemen. Despite their protracted deployment, the number of US drones lost to hostile fire was minimal, with only three MQ-9 Reapers shot down by the Houthis between [2017](https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/aviation/news/a28469/us-reaper-drone-shot-down-over-yemen/)
 and [2019](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security-usa-drone-idUSKCN1VB180/)
.

During the Houthis’ anti-shipping campaign, there has been a marked escalation in the group’s tactical proficiency against US drones. Four days later, the Houthis [boasted](https://x.com/AmeenHa2024yan/status/1874346837530087576)
 the downing of a second US-made drone in the Marib governorate, marking the first Houthi strike of an MQ-9 Reaper in 2025.

These attacks represent the latest in a long string of successful Houthi strikes against US UAVs since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war, showcasing the Houthis’ growing offensive capabilities. 

For the Yemeni militant group, imposing a heavy toll on the US drone fleet serves tactical, strategic, and symbolic goals at the domestic and regional levels. The strikes against MQ-9 Reaper drones impair US intelligence and targeting systems and help the Houthis shore up domestic and regional support. And, with the Houthis’ ties to China, Russia, and Iran, downed MQ-9 Reaper drones could end up in the hands of US adversaries. 

Given the benefits the Houthis continue to enjoy from shooting down these drones, the United States needs to adjust its drone deployment strategy to ensure that MQ-9 Reapers are less vulnerable to the militant group’s attacks. 

#### **The offensive**

The surge of attacks on US UAVs and the anti-shipping campaign are major pieces of the Houthi’s latest offensive. Since November 2023, the Houthis [have claimed](https://english.almasirah.net.ye/post/44879/)
 responsibility for downing fourteen MQ-9 Reaper drones, in a series of attacks that have targeted US assets primarily in Marib and Sa’ada governorates. However, those designs are either variants of Iranian weapon systems or based on Iran’s technology, such as the Sayyad-2C (Hunter) missile, the Saqr series (Iran’s 358 missile), and the Barq missile family (Iran’s Taer series). 

#### **Inside the Houthis’ strategy**

Tactically, the Houthi shootdowns of MQ-9 drones primarily aim to blind the US intelligence and targeting systems. The Houthis’ efforts to conceal strategic sites have heightened the Western coalition’s dependence on UAVs to collect actionable intelligence on military installations.

For the Houthis, the shootdowns of US drones also hold symbolic value. Factual or not, these claims serve to inflate the Houthis’ perceived combat strength and burnish their image as a militia capable of confronting US forces head-on.

#### **The Houthis’ dangerous partners**

Although the MQ-9 Reapers have been shot down over Yemen, the negative ramifications of these Houthi attacks on US military assets could spill over beyond the country’s borders. In addition, US intelligence revealed that [Iran mediated talks](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-brokering-talks-send-advanced-russian-missiles-yemens-houthis-sources-say-2024-09-24/)
between Russia and the Houthis that led to Moscow supplying Russian-made advanced anti-ship cruise missiles to the group. For instance, in mid-2019, Iran [rushed](https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5529508,00.html)
 to retrieve a US Navy MQ-4C Triton that the IRGC [shot down](https://www.reuters.com/article/markets/commodities/iran-shoots-down-us-military-drone-in-gulf-region-idUSL8N23R09Y/)
 over the Strait of Hormuz."

WASHINGTON — Houthi rebels in Yemen have shot down seven U.S. The drones were doing attack runs or conducting surveillance, and they crashed both into the water and onto land, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military operations.

The U.S. He promised to use "overwhelming lethal force" until the Houthis cease their attacks on shipping along a vital maritime corridor.

Central Command spokesman Dave Eastburn said Thursday night that the U.S. "These strikes have destroyed multiple command-and-control facilities, air defense systems, advanced weapons manufacturing facilities, advanced weapons storage locations, and killed hundreds of Houthi fighters and numerous Houthi leaders," Eastburn said.

Another defense official said that although hostile fire is likely the cause of the drone losses, the incidents are still under investigation."

CNN  — 

In the month since the US launched a major military campaign targeting the [Houthi rebel group in Yemen](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/06/middleeast/us-airstrikes-yemen-houthis-may-be-relishing-them-intl/index.html)
, the militants have successfully shot down at least seven multi-million-dollar American drones, hindering the US’ ability to move into “phase two” of the operation, multiple US officials familiar with the matter told CNN.

The US was hoping to achieve air superiority over Yemen within 30 days, officials said and degrade Houthi air defense systems enough to begin a new phase focusing on ramping up intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance of senior Houthi leaders in order to target and kill them, the officials said.

But the platforms best suited to conduct that persistent effort, the MQ9 Reaper drones, keep getting shot down, the officials explained. These assessments were largely based on signals intelligence, one of the people said.

![Yemenis watch a damaged vehicle at Farwah popular market which Houthis said it was struck by US airstrikes in Sanaa, Yemen, on April 21.](https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c-ap25111262672128.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill)

Asked for comment about the downed drones and whether it has negatively impacted the operation, a defense official told CNN in a statement that “we are aware of the Houthi reports these MQ-9s have been shot down. The strikes have forced the Houthis to stay underground more and left them in a “confused and disarrayed state,” the officials noted.

But the consistent loss of the drones has made it more difficult for the US to determine precisely how much the US has degraded the Houthis’ weapons stockpiles.

Over the last six weeks, the Houthis have launched 77 one-way attack drones, 30 cruise missiles, 24 medium-range ballistic missiles, and 23 surface-to-air missiles either at US forces, into the Red Sea, or at Israel, two of the officials said.

The intelligence community has also assessed in recent days that over nearly six weeks of US bombing, the Houthis’ ability and intent to keep lobbing missiles at US and commercial vessels in the Red Sea and at Israel is little changed, as is their command-and-control structure, according to two other people familiar with the intelligence. Trump posted on X in March that the Houthis “have been decimated” and their capabilities “are rapidly being destroyed.”

While Eastburn provided additional data on Thursday regarding the impact of US strikes, US Central Command has been largely silent about the impact, however, even as it routinely shares photos and videos on its X account of missiles firing off of warships or US aircraft preparing to launch off aircraft carriers in the Red Sea. The US does not have boots on the ground in Yemen, so it relies on overhead surveillance — much of it from the MQ9s—to conduct battlefield damage assessments and track terrorists.

CNN [reported earlier this month](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/04/politics/cost-us-military-houthis-limited-impact/index.html)
 that the US had killed several Houthi officials considered to be mid-level, akin to “middle management,” rather than senior political leadership.

The officials said the US had hit over 700 targets and launched more than 300 airstrikes since the campaign began on March 15. “Additionally, Houthi ballistic missile launches have dropped by 87% while attacks from their one-way drones have decreased by 65% since the beginning of these operations.”

The administration is vowing to continue with the campaign until the Houthis can no longer attack Red Sea shipping. In a letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson [last month](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/04/text-of-a-letter-from-the-president-to-the-speaker-of-the-house-of-representatives-and-the-president-pro-tempore-of-the-senate/)
, President Donald Trump said the operations would continue “until the Houthi threat to United States forces and navigational rights and freedoms in the Red Sea and adjacent waters has abated.”

But the Houthis have long proven to be extremely resilient, burying their equipment deep underground and continuing to receive supplies from Iran. The Pentagon has also not addressed claims by the Houthis that the airstrikes have killed dozens of civilians.

In a rare update, CENTCOM said last week that it had destroyed a port in Yemen that the Houthis were using to import oil and fuel their attacks. But the impact of that on the Houthis’ operations similarly remains unclear.

One of the US officials who spoke to CNN left the door open for a continuous campaign in support of US partners in the Gulf region against the Houthis, similar to how the US operates in Africa.

The costs of the campaign, meanwhile, are only rising. The operation [cost the US nearly $1 billion](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/04/politics/cost-us-military-houthis-limited-impact/index.html)
 in just the first three weeks, and the US has continued striking Houthi targets daily for over a month.

The large-scale operation has also rattled some officials at US Indo-Pacific Command, who CNN has reported had complained in recent weeks about the large number of long-range weapons being expended by CENTCOM that would be critical in the event of a war with China.

“We have to maintain a high state of indications and warning so we can get those forces back if there is a crisis with greater exigence than there is one in the CENTCOM (area of responsibility),” US Indo-Pacific Command Commander Adm."

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Atlantic Council reports that the Houthis have claimed responsibility for downing fourteen MQ-9 Reaper drones since November 2023, including one on December 28, 2024, and another in early 2025. The article also mentions that Iran mediated talks between Russia and the Houthis that led to Moscow supplying Russian-made advanced anti-ship cruise missiles to the group.

### Evidence from `geolocate`

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that the Houthis have shot down US Reaper drones. The Atlantic Council reports that the Houthis have claimed responsibility for downing fourteen MQ-9 Reaper drones since November 2023, including one in early 2025. [Source](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/menasource/houthi-strikes-on-us-mq9-reaper-drones/)

The evidence does not confirm that the image shows a US drone shot down in March 2025. The image search results show other images of drone crashes, but none of them match the image in the claim. The geolocation of the image suggests it was taken in Israel, which contradicts the claim that the drone was shot down by the Houthis in Yemen.

The claim is partially supported by the evidence, but the image's context is not verified. More information is needed to confirm the image's origin and the date of the incident.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

[!Russia Notes US Hypocrisy in California Fire Case <image:4830>](/en/news/2025/01/12/3236714/russia-notes-us-hypocrisy-in-california-fire-case)

### TEHRAN (Tasnim) - Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova commented on reports that hundreds of prisoners have been mobilized to extinguish fires in the US state of California, pointing to the hypocrisy of the US.

[\- Other Media news -](/en/service/1200/other-media)

Earlier, The Washington Post, citing the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, reported that the state authorities had sent 395 prisoners to fight forest fires. The diplomat noted that in 2023, Washington restricted imports of products from several Chinese companies in an attempt to exclude goods allegedly produced with the help of Uygur forced labor from the US supply chain.

"This raises a logical question: will Congress draft a bill imposing sanctions on California authorities, private companies, and ordinary Americans for using prison labor to put out fires?" she wondered. "We are so sick of this hypocrisy!" Zakharova added.

Wildfires began to spread across Los Angeles County on January 7."

Did Russia offer sanctuary to California residents who lost their homes in the Los Angeles fires? A viral X [post](https://x.com/jacksonhinklle/status/1879042008465183185)
 by Jackson Hinkle—a [regular purveyor](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/11/business/media/jackson-hinkle-israel-gaza-misinformation.html)
 of Russia-related misinformation—claims so.

“BREAKING: RUSSIA has offered shelter & sanctuary to Californians whose livelihoods were DESTROYED in the LA wildfires,” reads the post, which had more than 500,000 views on X as of January 15.

Assessing Claims That Russia Offered Sanctuary to California Fire Victims
=========================================================================

One Russian governor did make an offer, but there are some caveats.

! A single Russian governor said that he would welcome California fire victims to the region of occupied Ukraine he oversees, but only if they don’t support the government in Kyiv.

On Monday, Vladimir Saldo, the governor of the Russian-occupied Kherson oblast region of Ukraine, [told](https://tass.ru/obschestvo/22867057)
 _TASS_—a Russian state-controlled media outlet—that the region would accept any Americans who lost their homes in this month’s California fires. “Despite the ongoing, blatantly anti-Russian policy of the United States, we fully understand that natural disasters don’t care who you are or what you do,” Saldo said, [according to](https://www.rt.com/russia/610836-california-fires-sanctuary-kherson/)
 Russia Today, a Russian state-controlled network that translated the statement into English. Therefore, our region is ready to welcome any American citizen who has lost their home and livelihood.”

That offer comes with a caveat, applying only to Californians who haven’t supported Ukraine since Russia invaded its borders in February 2022. Sutton")

The Russian goverment has made no such offer. “The California fires have left many ordinary residents homeless."

Other Russian Telegram channels are also spreading false or unverified narratives about the southern California fires and the government's response, as well as amplifying critiques from Americans including the president-elect's son, Donald Trump, Jr., Andy Carvin of the Atlantic Council's DFRLab told NPR in an email. The Russian news site [Pravda](https://web.archive.org/web/20250115205032/https://news-pravda.com/world/2025/01/08/963104.html)

"Over the last week, Pravda has published at least 350 stories of this type \[based on Telegram messages about the fires\], based on our initial content analysis of the site," Carvin said.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that Russia commented on the California wildfires and that Vladimir Saldo offered sanctuary to fire victims. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Russia offered assistance for the California wildfires.

The NPR article suggests that Russian news sites spread false or unverified narratives about the fires. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.

To verify the claim, information about any specific offers of assistance from Russia would be needed.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Tasnim News Agency published an article on January 12, 2025, discussing Russia's comments on the California wildfires, including comments from Maria Zakharova. The article mentions that wildfires began to spread across Los Angeles County on January 7. ([https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2025/01/12/3236714/russia-notes-us-hypocrisy-in-california-fire-case](https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2025/01/12/3236714/russia-notes-us-hypocrisy-in-california-fire-case)) <image:4830>, <image:4831>

The Dispatch published an article on January 15, 2025, discussing claims that Russia offered sanctuary to California fire victims. Vladimir Saldo offered to accept Americans who lost their homes in the California fires, but only those who haven't supported Ukraine since February 2022. ([https://thedispatch.com/article/assessing-claims-that-russia-offered-sanctuary-to-california-fire-victims/](https://thedispatch.com/article/assessing-claims-that-russia-offered-sanctuary-to-california-fire-victims/)) <image:4838>

An NPR article, published on January 16, 2025, discusses how pro-Kremlin social media accounts spread a narrative about the Los Angeles wildfires. The article states that Russian news sites are spreading false or unverified narratives about the California fires. ([https://www.npr.org/2025/01/16/nx-s1-5259842/los-angeles-california-fires-russia-ukraine](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/16/nx-s1-5259842/los-angeles-california-fires-russia-ukraine)) <image:4849>, <image:4853>


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Russia commented on the California wildfires and that Vladimir Saldo offered sanctuary to fire victims. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Russia offered assistance for the California wildfires.

The NPR article suggests that Russian news sites spread false or unverified narratives about the fires. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.

To verify the claim, information about any specific offers of assistance from Russia would be needed.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The search results show that Russia commented on the California wildfires and offered sanctuary to fire victims, but there is no evidence of Russia offering assistance. Furthermore, some sources suggest that Russian news sites spread false narratives about the fires.

Since the claim is not supported by the evidence, the most appropriate decision option is `false`.

The devastating Russian-Ukrainian war has been ongoing for several years, with the United States and NATO providing support to Ukraine. A report can be read [here](https://tass.com/russia/1728697)
. 

**Clarification:**

Peskov’s Comments: It is important to note that Peskov’s remarks about the United States being an “enemy” were part of a broader narrative criticizing American policies and actions towards Russia. The confusion may stem from a recent shift in Russian officials’ rhetoric amid ongoing tensions over the Ukraine conflict.

**Background:**

**Recent Statements by Russian Officials:** Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov referred to the United States as an “enemy” state in a recent press interaction. More details can be read [here](https://www.trtworld.com/us-and-canada/russia-formally-declares-the-us-as-enemy-what-next-18170984)
.

**Misinterpretation**: Peskov’s statement, “We are now an enemy country for them, just as they are for us,” has been misinterpreted on social media as a declaration of war. This is a significant escalation from the term “unfriendly states” that Russian officials have used previously to describe the United States and its allies.

**Context**: Peskov’s comments followed actions by the Biden administration, allowing Ukraine to use American-supplied weapons to attack targets within Russia. In this context, a significant amount of misleading information regarding the situation is being spread on social media.

**Social Media Posts** 

Social media posts claim that Russia has declared war against the USA.

! Details can be read [here](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy770l9llnzo)
. 

**Historical Rhetoric:** Russian President Vladimir Putin has previously referred to the Western countries’ elites as Russia’s enemies while characterizing Ukraine as a tool used by the West. The rhetoric from Russian officials reflects escalating tensions but does not amount to a declaration of war. Social media users should be cautious about misinterpreting or amplifying such statements without verifying the facts through reliable sources.

Ukrainians sought shelter in underground shelters as Russian forces attacked on 24 February 2022

Launching the biggest European invasion since the end of World War Two, Putin gave a fiery speech on TV declaring his goal was to "demilitarise and denazify" Ukraine.

Russia has repeatedly painted modern Ukraine as a Nazi state, in a crass distortion of history.

Putin had already seized Ukraine's Crimean peninsula eight years earlier, after a revolution that ousted Ukraine's pro-Russian president and replaced him with a more pro-Western government.

Putin then triggered a lower-level war in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, with pro-Russian proxy forces occupying territory and setting up rebel states supported by Moscow.

But the 2022 invasion was on a different scale.

Putin had just [recognised the rebel states as independent](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-europe-60470900)
. He has spoken of the Ukrainian leader's "illegitimacy" - a false narrative that has also been repeated by President Trump.

As evidence Putin cites the postponement of Ukraine's March 2024 presidential election, although it is because of Russia's war that Ukraine is under martial law and elections are barred under the constitution.

Putin's own re-election in 2024 is highly questionable, as Russia's opposition leaders are either in exile or dead.

Was Nato expansion to blame for the war?
----------------------------------------

Putin has for years complained about Nato's eastward expansion as a security threat, and sees any possibility of Ukraine joining the alliance as a major red line.

Before Russia's 2022 invasion he demanded that Nato remove multinational deployments from the Central and Eastern European states that joined the Western alliance after 1997.

But it was Russia that launched military action in Eastern Europe, when it invaded Georgia in 2008 and then Crimea in 2014.

After the Crimea invasion, Nato established a continuous presence on its eastern flank - closest to Russia.

Nato has always stressed the whole purpose of the alliance is to defend territories "with no aggressive intentions". <image:2680>!A map showing the expansion of Nato over time <image:2687>

Zelensky said as much two weeks into the invasion: "Nato is not prepared to accept Ukraine."

He has since said he would consider resigning in exchange for Nato membership, but Trump says Kyiv should "forget about" joining the Western alliance.

Putin has accused Nato of participating in the war, because its member states have increasingly sent Ukraine military hardware, including tanks and fighter jets, air defence systems, missile systems, artillery and drones.

Nato has provided security assistance and training to Ukraine, but it insists that does not make it a party to the war.

Putin's grievance against Nato dates back to 1990, when he claims the West promised not to expand "an inch to the East".

However that was before the Soviet Union collapsed and it was based on a limited commitment made to then Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.

Gorbachev said "the topic of Nato expansion was never discussed" at the time.

How could the war end?
----------------------

The most likely route is through direct talks, although previous rounds of negotiations between the two sides made little progress on a ceasefire.

After a fifth visit to Moscow by Trump envoy Steve Witkoff on 6 August, the US president said a there was a "good chance" he could meet the Russian and Ukrainian leaders for talks in person.

The Kremlin also said a Trump-Putin meeting would happen in the coming days, but Putin ruled out an imminent meeting with Zelensky, saying the right conditions were not in place.

So far though, the two sides have been unable to find a way of bridging their differences.

Russia wants direct talks to address the "root causes of the conflict", a phrase that harks back to Putin's "maximalist" demands at the start of the war in March 2022.

These included Ukraine becoming a neutral state, dramatically reducing its military and abandoning its Nato aspirations.

Russia also wants international recognition of its territorial gains in Ukraine reflected in any future deal, including annexation of Crimea and four eastern regions. <image:2680>!Reuters Vladimir Putin remembering Russia's victory over Nazi Germany wears a long coat as soldiers pass him by carrying swords <image:2689>Reuters

Vladimir Putin has made repeated false allegations of genocide and Nazi taunts against Ukraine

At the start of the 2022 invasion, Putin vowed to protect people in occupied areas of eastern Ukraine from eight years of Ukrainian "bullying and genocide, during the war in the east.

More than 14,000 people died on both sides of the front line between 2014-2022, but Russian claims of Ukrainian Nazis committing genocide in the occupied regions never added up, and no international body has spoken of genocide. It abandoned its nuclear weapons in 1994 in return for guaranteed security from Russia, the UK and US which Moscow failed to respect.

Since the war, many Ukrainians have turned their back on Russian, and Zelensky himself avoids using the language in public.

When Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered up to 200,000 soldiers into Ukraine, his aim was to sweep into the capital, Kyiv, in days, overthrow its pro-Western government and return Ukraine to Russia's sphere of influence.

Putin failed but, more than three years on, a fifth of Ukrainian territory is in Russian hands.

US President Donald Trump has been trying to negotiate a peace deal and the Kremlin says Putin will meet Trump "in the coming days". Last year he told US TV talk show host Tucker Carlson that Ukraine was an "artificial state".

Those comments have led many to believe that the goal of the invasion was in effect to erase the state of Ukraine.

Russia's state-run Ria news agency explained that "denazification is inevitably also de-Ukrainisation" - seemingly tying the idea of erasing Ukraine to the stated goal of the invasion.

Ukrainian culture and identity have in fact existed for centuries independently of Russia.

Does Putin want to get rid of Zelensky?
---------------------------------------

! <image:2680>!Getty Images The president of Ukraine holds his hands out, flanked by two Ukrainian flags <image:2685>Getty Images

Volodymyr Zelensky was elected president in Ukraine in 2019

Putin has long sought to get rid of Ukraine's elected pro-Western president, and Zelensky was apparently a target from the very start of the war.

Russian troops made two attempts to storm the presidential compound soon after the invasion, according to Zelensky's adviser, and Ukraine's elected leader said they wanted him dead.

"The enemy has designated me as target number one; my family is target number two.

"[They want to destroy Ukraine politically](https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/zvernennya-prezidenta-do-ukrayinciv-naprikinci-pershogo-dnya-73149)
 by destroying the head of state."

Zelensky said later that Putin had initially tried to replace him with the wealthy head of a pro-Russian party, Viktor Medvedchuk, who was accused of treason in Ukraine and is now in Russia.

Even now, Putin has not agreed to peace talks with Zelensky and his officials call him a "loser" and a "clown". It will also look for Western security guarantees to ensure Russia never invades its territory again.

Was Zelensky to blame for the war?
----------------------------------

Before his return to the White House and in the first months of his presidency, Trump suggested Ukraine's president was responsible for the war with Russia.

"\[Zelensky\] should never have let the war start, that war's a loser," he said in October 2024.

In reality, the war began in 2014, when Putin seized Crimea and Russian proxies grabbed part of eastern Ukraine. Putin then ordered Russia's full-scale invasion eight years later, after months of meticulous co-ordination and denials of any such plan.

However, the US president's messaging has not been altogether consistent, and in recent weeks his position appears to have hardened against Russia.

"We thought we had \[the war\] settled numerous times, and then President Putin goes out and starts launching rockets into some city like Kyiv and kills a lot of people," he said last month.

Trump has announced sweeping new secondary tariffs on any country still trading with Russia if a ceasefire with Ukraine is not agreed by Friday, 8 August.

Do Putin's claims on Nazis and genocide stack up?

From [Source](https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/what-putin-fears-most/): 
Content: "After each of them—Serbia in 2000, Georgia in 2003, Ukraine in 2004, the Arab Spring in 2011, Russia in 2011–12, and Ukraine in 2013–14—Putin has pivoted to more hostile policies toward the United States, and then invoked the NATO threat as justification for doing so.

Boris Yeltsin never supported NATO expansion but acquiesced to the first round of expansion in 1997 because he believed that his close ties to President Bill Clinton and the United States were not worth sacrificing over this comparatively smaller matter. Following John Mearsheimer’s provocative 2014 _Foreign Affairs_ article arguing that “the Ukraine crisis is the West’s fault,” the narrative of Russian backlash against NATO expansion has become a dominant framework for explaining—if not justifying—Moscow’s ongoing war against Ukraine.[1](#f1)
 This notion has been repeated not only in Moscow but in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere by politicians, analysts, and writers. By this telling, the specter of Ukraine’s NATO membership points both to the cause of the conflict and its solution: Take membership off the table for Ukraine, so the argument goes, and future wars will be prevented.

### Michael McFaul

_**Michael McFaul**, former U.S. If NATO was _always_ a threat to Russia and its “sphere of influence,” why did Putin facilitate the opening of these bases in the former Soviet Union?

During his November 2001 visit to the United States, Putin struck a realistic but cooperative tone:

> We differ in the ways and means we perceive that are suitable for reaching the same objective . Putin blamed the United States directly for assisting this democratic breakthrough and helping to install someone whom he saw as a pro-American puppet, President Mikheil Saakashvili. Since the Revolution of Dignity, Putin has waged an unprecedented assault against Ukraine’s democracy using a full spectrum of military, political, informational, social, and economic weapons in an attempt to destabilize and eventually topple Ukraine’s democratically elected government.[18](#f18)
 Ukraine’s relationship with NATO and the United States was just a symptom of what Putin believes is the underlying disease: a sovereign, democratic Ukraine.

Putin’s Real _Casus Belli_: Ukrainian Democracy
-----------------------------------------------

Amazingly, eight years of unrelenting Russian pressure did not break Ukraine’s democracy.

Content: "For one, the [IMF](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2025/01/17/world-economic-outlook-update-january-2025)
 and [World Bank](https://thedocs.worldbank.org/en/doc/c50bc3c87bc2666b9e5fa6699b0b2849-0050012025/related/GEP-Jan-2025-Analysis-ECA.pdf)
 estimate that the Russian economy grew by 3.8% and 3.4%, respectively, in 2024.3 Looking ahead, both expect the Russian economy to continue growing in 2025–2026, even though this growth is expected to slow down. The same year saw 19 new Russian dollar billionaires join Forbes’s ranking, which is the highest number of new dollar billionaires Russia has produced since 2011, according to [Re: Russia](https://re-russia.net/en/analytics/0233/)
.

As the economy grew in 2024, so did Russia’s budget revenues, even though this growth was not sufficient to eliminate the aforementioned budget deficit. Olga Chyzh of the University of Toronto also took a dim view of the Russian economy in her recent commentary for The Guardian, entitled “A string of assassinations, a [faltering economy](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/dec/19/russia-assassinations-economy-workers-putin)
, a shortage of workers: the pressure on Putin is ratcheting up.” In this Dec. 2024, commentary, Chyzh writes that Russia’s “economy is faltering under the combined strain of the war and Western sanctions.” “War-driven salary increases … have triggered a vicious cycle of inflation and subsequent interest-rate hikes. Writing in The Hill in October 2024, he predicts that a “Russian economic meltdown is coming next year.” “Leonid Brezhnev’s Soviet Union should have taught Putin a lesson,” warns Motyl, who has repeatedly predicted [Russia’s collapse](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=Alexander+Motyl+Russia+collapse)

,” on American journalist Tim Mak’s Substack, “Counteroffensive.” The Kyiv-based Euromaidan Press outlet then published a commentary by [Yurii Bohdanov](https://euromaidanpress.com/author/yuriybohdanov/ "View all posts by Yurii Bohdanov")
 on Jan. 17, 2025, in which he claims that “even ‘freezing’ the war in Ukraine will not solve Russia’s economic problems… and a freeze only delays the inevitable collapse.” 

### Russia Doesn’t Have a Clean Bill of Health

Some of the aforementioned criticism of what the [IMF](https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/PPPSH@WEO/OEMDC/ADVEC/WEOWORLD)
 ranks as the world’s 4th largest economy in terms of PPP is valid. In fact, Russia’s budget revenues in December 2024 reached more than 4 trillion rubles ($40 billion), up by 28% compared to December 2023, the highest level recorded in ministry data beginning from January 2011, according to [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-21/russia-s-budget-revenue-surges-to-record-in-december-despite-sanctions "(opens in a new window)")
.5 One sector of the Russian economy which provides much of the money6 that is accumulated in the Russian budget and that the Kremlin then spends on its war, is the energy sector. Gazprom, the national gas champion, is estimated to have lost more [than $3 billion](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/gazprom-reports-9-month-loss-32-billion-2024-10-29/)
 in the first nine months of 2024, for instance.)

### Conclusion 

No economy is completely healthy, and Russia’s is, by far, no exception, particularly given Western sanctions and its rampant spending on the military-industrial complex and the war against Ukraine.

Is Russia’s Economy Collapsing?
===============================

February 06, 2025

[Simon Saradzhyan](/authors/simon-saradzhyan)

The past few months have seen a number of Russia watchers echo each other’s proclamations that the Russian economy is either already collapsing or close to crumbling. 

Will these predictions materialize?

###### Chapter 3: Understanding the Social Acceptability of Structural Reforms

Structural reforms are urgently needed as the world grapples with low growth, demographic shifts, and challenges related to the green and technological transitions. However, notable revisions have taken place beneath the surface since April 2024, with upgrades to the forecast for the United States offsetting downgrades to those for other advanced economies, in particular, the largest European countries. With cyclical imbalances in the global economy waning, near-term policy priorities should be carefully calibrated to ensure a smooth landing."

## Claim
Claim: "In October 2024 the International Monetary Fund (IMF) declared Russia the fourth-largest economy in the world."

## Actions
```
web_search("IMF Russia economy ranking October 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The IMF website provides information about Russia, including its membership date, quota, and Special Drawing Rights, and includes a link to the July 2025 World Economic Outlook Update, which projects a 0.9% change in real GDP for 2025 (<image:2695>). The IMF ranks Russia as the world's 4th largest economy in terms of PPP.

The article from russiamatters.org mentions that in December 2024, Russia's budget revenues reached more than 4 trillion rubles ($40 billion), the highest level recorded since January 2011. The article was published on February 06, 2025.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the IMF ranks Russia as the world's 4th largest economy in terms of PPP. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that this ranking was declared in October 2024. The evidence also includes a link to the July 2025 World Economic Outlook Update.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified without additional information confirming the exact date of the IMF's declaration.

"The rise in growth reflects a substantial fiscal stimulus, strong investment, and resilient consumption in the context of a tight labour market," the IMF said on Tuesday in its World Economic Outlook, in reference to this year's forecast.

Russia's economy ministry expects gross domestic product (GDP) to expand 2.8% this year, bouncing back from a 2.1% decline in 2022. In its July outlook, the IMF had forecast 1.5% growth.

But the IMF lowered its forecast from 1.3% for 2024, giving Russia the weakest projections in its list of major emerging market and developing economies, for whom average growth this year and next is seen at 4%.

Russia's economy ministry forecasts 2.3% growth next year, while the Bank of Russia's forecast range is 0.5-1.5%.

Oct 10 (Reuters) - Russia's economy will grow by 1.1% in 2024, slower than previously forecast, the International Monetary Fund said, after significant spending and resilient consumption in a stretched labour market support growth of 2.2% this year.

The IMF said Western sanctions on Russian crude oil exports have had mixed effects, with Russian oil now trading above the $60 price cap imposed by the Group of Seven nations.

 have said, especially as areas like schools and healthcare face effective spending freezes in the years ahead.

The Developments in Russia Despite the pressure of unprecedented sanctions, the Russian economy continues to show consistently high growth rates, systematically surpassing most forecasts, including those of the IMF. INTERNATIONAL MONETARY AND FINANCIAL COMMITTEE Fiftieth Meeting October 24–25, 2024 Statement No. Amid complex challenges and numerous risks facing the global economy, the IMF should enhance the effectiveness of its bilateral and multilateral surveillance, assist member countries in strengthening institutional capacities, and continue to refine its lending toolkit. The IMF should fully adhere to its mandate and fulfill its obligations to member countries, as outlined in the Articles of Agreement, to further promote equitable international cooperation for the economic development of all countries. The global public debt-to- GDP ratio continues to rise: it grew from 92.8 percent in 2023 to 93.5 percent in 2024 and is expected to further increase to 94.8 percent in 2025. 2 Geoeconomic fragmentation is increasingly diminishing the efficiency of the global economy. Russia continues to pursue responsible fiscal policy and maintains macroeconomic stability. Fiscal policy priorities remain focused on fulfilling all social obligations to the population and enhancing Russia’s defense capacity and technological self-sufficiency. Despite external constraints, by the end of this year, Russia's public debt will be less than 15 percent of GDP and will remain at a safe level in the upcoming three-year period."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The IMF published the World Economic Outlook in October 2024, which included analysis of the global economy. A statement by the Minister of Finance of the Russian Federation at the IMFC meeting in Washington, DC, on October 24-25, 2024, mentioned that the Russian economy was growing faster than most forecasts, including those of the IMF. The IMF ranks Russia as the world's 4th largest economy in terms of PPP.

The evidence supports the claim that the IMF was actively analyzing the Russian economy in October 2024. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the IMF declared Russia the fourth-largest economy in the world in October 2024.

Therefore, the claim is likely true, but it cannot be definitively verified based on the provided evidence.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "In October 2024 the International Monetary Fund (IMF) declared Russia the fourth-largest economy in the world."

## Actions
```
web_search("IMF Russia economy ranking October 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The IMF website provides information about Russia, including its membership date, quota, and Special Drawing Rights, and includes a link to the July 2025 World Economic Outlook Update, which projects a 0.9% change in real GDP for 2025 (<image:2695>). The IMF ranks Russia as the world's 4th largest economy in terms of PPP.

The article from russiamatters.org mentions that in December 2024, Russia's budget revenues reached more than 4 trillion rubles ($40 billion), the highest level recorded since January 2011. The article was published on February 06, 2025.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the IMF ranks Russia as the world's 4th largest economy in terms of PPP. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that this ranking was declared in October 2024. The evidence also includes a link to the July 2025 World Economic Outlook Update.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified without additional information confirming the exact date of the IMF's declaration.


## Actions

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The IMF website provides the World Economic Outlook, October 2024, which includes projections and analysis of the global economy, and also provides a link to the July 2025 World Economic Outlook Update. The October 2024 report discusses global growth, policy pivots, and rising threats. (<image:8298>) [https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2024/10/22/world-economic-outlook-october-2024](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2024/10/22/world-economic-outlook-october-2024)

A Reuters article from October 10, 2023, states that the IMF lowered its forecast for Russia's 2024 GDP growth to 1.1%. (<image:8308>) [https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/imf-lowers-russia-2024-gdp-growth-forecast-11-2023-10-10/](https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/imf-lowers-russia-2024-gdp-growth-forecast-11-2023-10-10/) A statement by the Minister of Finance of the Russian Federation at the IMFC meeting in Washington, DC, on October 24-25, 2024, mentions that the Russian economy continues to show consistently high growth rates, surpassing most forecasts, including those of the IMF. [https://www.imfconnect.org/content/dam/imf/Spring-Annual%20Meetings/AM/24/IMFCStatePub/IMFC-S-50-24-22%20-%20Stmt%20-%20Mr.%20Siluanov%20-%20Russian%20Federation.pdf](https://www.imfconnect.org/content/dam/imf/Spring-Annual%20Meetings/AM/24/IMFCStatePub/IMFC-S-50-24-22%20-%20Stmt%20-%20Mr.%20Siluanov%20-%20Russian%20Federation.pdf)


## Elaboration
The IMF published the World Economic Outlook in October 2024, which included analysis of the global economy. A statement by the Minister of Finance of the Russian Federation at the IMFC meeting in Washington, DC, on October 24-25, 2024, mentioned that the Russian economy was growing faster than most forecasts, including those of the IMF. The IMF ranks Russia as the world's 4th largest economy in terms of PPP.

The evidence supports the claim that the IMF was actively analyzing the Russian economy in October 2024. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the IMF declared Russia the fourth-largest economy in the world in October 2024.

Therefore, the claim is likely true, but it cannot be definitively verified based on the provided evidence.

!IMF ranks Russia as world’s fourth-largest economy by purchasing power <image:8326>

**Russia just clinched fourth place on the global economic ladder, based on purchasing power parity (PPP), in new data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).**

This makes Russia one of the top contributors to global economic growth, moving ahead of several Western economies. PPP adjusts for price differences across countries, giving more weight to nations with large populations and lower costs of living.

With this [ranking](https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2024/10/24/tr102424-transcript-of-eur-reo)
, Russia now joins China, the U.S., and India in the top four, adding muscle to the economic power of BRICS. This year alone, they’ve met twice, once in Beijing and once at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Kazakhstan.

Putin is also working closely with India, maintaining New Delhi as a strategic ally from the Cold War era despite Russia’s tight relations with India’s rival, China.

Western allies have tried to get Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to press Moscow on Ukraine, but he has avoided criticizing [Russia](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/russian-crypto-queen-stole-for-ukraine-army/)
, focusing instead on peace and his seemingly close friendship with Putin.

[!World Bank sold $510 million in bonds backed by loans to 57 companies in emerging markets. Over the next five years, the IMF sees China, India, Russia, and Brazil driving growth far more than the Group of Seven (G7), which includes the U.S., Germany, and Japan.

G7 countries, known for their strong GDPs, are now expected to contribute less, with BRICS economies filling in the gap.

### BRICS outpaces G7

Among the BRICS, China is expected to lead the charge, contributing 22% of global growth through 2029 — more than all G7 countries combined. The IMF’s PPP model shows that developing nations, thanks to their populations and relatively lower prices, are playing a stronger role in the global economy.

In surprising detail, the IMF’s numbers illustrate this trend. We certainly welcome statements of this kind, no matter who makes them.” When asked about North Korean troops allegedly stationed in Russia, Putin neither confirmed nor denied the reports.

The U.S. Russia wants to sidestep sanctions with an alternative payment network to SWIFT, the global bank messaging system.

In a statement, summit members raised concerns over “unlawful unilateral coercive measures, including illegal sanctions” and emphasized the importance of cheaper, safer, transparent, and inclusive cross-border payments.

They committed to reducing trade barriers, ensuring non-discriminatory access, and advancing faster, more efficient payment systems.

The original [BRICS](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/no-new-countries-will-join-brics-putin-says-thats-enough-as-saudi-officially-declines-at-summit/)
 has expanded to include Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia."

The IMF published the World Economic Outlook in October 2024, which included analysis of the global economy. A statement by the Minister of Finance of the Russian Federation at the IMFC meeting in Washington, DC, on October 24-25, 2024, mentioned that the Russian economy was growing faster than most forecasts, including those of the IMF. The IMF ranks Russia as the world's 4th largest economy in terms of PPP.

The evidence supports the claim that the IMF was actively analyzing the Russian economy in October 2024. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the IMF declared Russia the fourth-largest economy in the world in October 2024.

Therefore, the claim is likely true, but it cannot be definitively verified based on the provided evidence.

Amid complex challenges and numerous risks facing the global economy, the IMF should enhance the effectiveness of its bilateral and multilateral surveillance, assist member countries in strengthening institutional capacities, and continue to refine its lending toolkit. 50-22 Statement by Mr. The global public debt-to- GDP ratio continues to rise: it grew from 92.8 percent in 2023 to 93.5 percent in 2024 and is expected to further increase to 94.8 percent in 2025. 2 Geoeconomic fragmentation is increasingly diminishing the efficiency of the global economy. Russia continues to pursue responsible fiscal policy and maintains macroeconomic stability. Fiscal policy priorities remain focused on fulfilling all social obligations to the population and enhancing Russia’s defense capacity and technological self-sufficiency. Despite external constraints, by the end of this year, Russia's public debt will be less than 15 percent of GDP and will remain at a safe level in the upcoming three-year period."
