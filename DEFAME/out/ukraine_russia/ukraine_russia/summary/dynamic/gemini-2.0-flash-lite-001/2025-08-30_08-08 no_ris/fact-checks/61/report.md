### Evidence from `web_search`
Newsweek reports that a limousine from Vladimir Putin's presidential fleet caught fire near the FSB headquarters in Moscow, with the cause unknown and no confirmation of Putin's presence in the car.

The Economic Times article mentions that the explosion raised security concerns, and The Sun reported the explosion amid rumors about Putin's health and after Zelensky's statement that Putin would die soon.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that a limousine from Vladimir Putin's presidential fleet was involved in an incident, with reports of a fire and an explosion. However, there is no confirmation that Putin was in the vehicle.

News outlets like Newsweek, The Hindustan Times, and The Economic Times reported on the incident, with some speculating about an assassination attempt. The Sun also reported on the explosion, linking it to rumors about Putin's health.

The claim that Putin died in an explosion in his limousine cannot be verified with the available information. The evidence only confirms an incident involving a vehicle from Putin's fleet, but not his presence or death.


## Final Judgement
The search results confirm that a limousine from Putin's fleet was involved in an incident, but there is no evidence to support the claim that Putin died in an explosion. The reports mention a fire and an explosion, but not Putin's presence or death.

`false`
