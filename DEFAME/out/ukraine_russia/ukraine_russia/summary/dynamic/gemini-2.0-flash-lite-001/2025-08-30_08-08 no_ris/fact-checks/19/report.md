## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The 2024 G20 summit was held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from November 18–19, 2024, with the theme "Building a Just World and a Sustainable Planet" (<image:0>, [Source](https://katv.com/news/nation-world/brazil-rio-de-janeiro-hosts-g20-summit-amid-global-tensions-ukraine-russia-israel-hamas-war-and-donald-trumps-election-victory-fighting-hunger-president-luiz-incio-lula-da-silva-joe-biden-white-house) and [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_G20_Rio_de_Janeiro_summit)). Giorgia Meloni, Prime Minister of Italy, attended the summit ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_G20_Rio_de_Janeiro_summit)).

Anadolu Agency reported that Meloni stated she understood the US's decision to allow Ukraine to use long-range missiles inside Russia, but Italy made a different choice ([Source](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/europe/italian-premier-says-she-understands-us-response-to-russia-but-rome-makes-a-different-choice/3398224)).


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Giorgia Meloni attended the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro in November 2024. She commented on the US's decision regarding the use of long-range missiles by Ukraine inside Russia. However, the evidence does not support the claim that she condemned the US-Ukrainian bombing of Russia.

The available information suggests that Meloni expressed understanding of the US's position while Italy made a different choice.

To verify the claim, information about Meloni's specific statements regarding the US-Ukrainian bombing of Russia at the G20 summit is missing.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Guardian ([Source](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/nov/19/russia-ukraine-war-live-moscow-kyiv-volodymyr-zelenskyy-latest-news-updates)) reported on the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro, mentioning Keir Starmer and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, but not Giorgia Meloni. Euractiv ([Source](https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/news/china-urges-calm-after-putin-decree-on-broader-use-of-nuclear-weapons/)) discussed the summit, focusing on discussions between Macron, Xi Jinping, and Putin, and China's call for calm. The Bloomberg source ([Source](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/live-blog/2024-11-19/g-20-summit-in-rio-de-janeiro-nov-19)) provided no content.


## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim. The search results do not contain any information about Giorgia Meloni condemning the US-Ukrainian bombing of Russia at the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that Giorgia Meloni attended the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro in November 2024. While she commented on the US's stance on Ukraine's use of long-range missiles, there is no evidence to support the claim that she condemned the US-Ukrainian bombing of Russia. Further searches also failed to provide any evidence of such condemnation.

Given the lack of evidence supporting the claim and the absence of any mention of Meloni condemning the bombing, the claim is considered false. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
There is no evidence to support the claim that Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni condemned the US-Ukrainian bombing of Russia at the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro in November 2024. While Meloni attended the summit ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_G20_Rio_de_Janeiro_summit)) and commented on the US's position on Ukraine's use of long-range missiles ([Source](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/europe/italian-premier-says-she-understands-us-response-to-russia-but-rome-makes-a-different-choice/3398224)), searches did not yield any information about her condemning the bombing.
