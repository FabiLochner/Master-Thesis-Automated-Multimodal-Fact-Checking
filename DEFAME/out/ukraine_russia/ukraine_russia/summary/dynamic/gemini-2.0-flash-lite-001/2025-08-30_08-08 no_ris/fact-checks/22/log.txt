Content: The BBC published an article about the Beirut explosion, including a damage assessment map <image:8236>.

The claim '<image:12> This image shows a chemical attack by the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the Kursk offensive in August 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is unverified. While the provided evidence confirms the existence of the Kursk offensive and discussions about chemical weapons use in Ukraine, it does not directly link the image to a chemical attack by the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the Kursk offensive. The image's origin and the nature of the explosion remain unconfirmed.

So, the overall veracity is: false
