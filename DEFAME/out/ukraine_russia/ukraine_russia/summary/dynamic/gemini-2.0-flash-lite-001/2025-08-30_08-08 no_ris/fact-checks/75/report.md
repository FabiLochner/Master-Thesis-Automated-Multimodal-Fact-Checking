## Elaboration
The image's geolocation data suggests it was most likely taken in Ukraine or Russia. The image search results provide context, including an article from The Telegraph on August 14, 2024, about Ukraine seizing land in the border region. This aligns with the claim's timeframe of August 2024. The presence of an American flag on the soldiers' uniforms, as seen in the image, supports the claim of American involvement.

However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that the individuals in the image are mercenaries. The Telegraph article mentions Ukrainian servicemen, but it does not specify their nationality. Further information is needed to confirm the claim that the individuals are American mercenaries.

The evidence does not provide information about the incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast.
