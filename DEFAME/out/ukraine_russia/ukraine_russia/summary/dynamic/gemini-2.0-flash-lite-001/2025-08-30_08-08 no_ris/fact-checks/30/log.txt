Useful result: From [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/30/russia-ukraine-war-list-of-key-events-day-1283): 
Content: Al Jazeera published an article on August 30, 2025, detailing the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine. The article discusses recent attacks, including a Russian strike on Kyiv that killed 25 people, and mentions that peace talks are ongoing. It also mentions that the US told the United Nations Security Council that deadly strikes "cast doubt on the seriousness of Russiaâ€™s desire for peace." <image:0>.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/turkey-peace-talks-russia-ukraine-invasion-timeline-b2750560.html): 
Content: The Independent published a timeline of the Russia-Ukraine war. On February 28, 2025, Zelenskyy met with Trump in the White House, but tensions arose, and a proposed minerals deal was left unsigned (<image:8199>). On February 12, 2025, Trump and Putin spoke directly and agreed to begin negotiations. On February 18, 2025, both sides agreed to a plan, but soon accused each other of violations. On April 19, 2025, Putin announced a 30-hour ceasefire. On May 10, 2025, European leaders met with Zelenskyy in Kyiv and urged Russia to enact a 30-day truce. On May 11, 2025, Putin proposed restarting direct talks with Ukraine in Istanbul on May 15.

The claim 'In early 2025, Ukraine and Russia had reached a peace deal in their years-long war.' is false.
Justification: The evidence, including reports from The Guardian, CNN, and The Independent, indicates that peace negotiations between Ukraine and Russia were ongoing in early 2025, with meetings and discussions taking place. However, the provided sources do not confirm that a peace deal was reached during that period. The Independent mentions an agreement in February 2025, but also reports violations, and the timeline includes ceasefires and proposals for further talks, suggesting that a final deal was not yet finalized. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.

So, the overall veracity is: false
