Useful result: From [Source](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/01/g-s1-51506/european-leaders-react-to-zelenskyy-oval-office): 
Content: The NPR article, published on March 1, 2025, reports on European leaders' reactions to a meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy on February 28, 2025, in the Oval Office. The article mentions that Annalena Baerbock, Germany's foreign minister, stated that Germany and other European allies stood united "alongside Ukraine — and against the Russian aggression." <image:8256>, <image:8258>, <image:8261>.

The claim 'In February 2025 German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock threatened the US with severing ties amid US President Donald Trump's comments on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Ukraine.' is false.
Justification: The claim is **unverified**. While Annalena Baerbock made critical comments about Donald Trump's stance on Ukraine in February 2025, the evidence is contradictory regarding whether she threatened to sever ties with the US. One source denies the threat, while another suggests it.

So, the overall veracity is: false
