Mexican President-elect Claudia Sheinbaum has declined an invitation from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to visit Ukraine, reaffirming Mexico’s commitment to neutrality in international conflicts. 

Zelensky had extended the invitation, hoping for an official Mexican visit to witness the effects of Russia’s invasion. <image:439>

Mexico played an active role in the United Nations, joining other countries in condemning Russia’s actions and co-sponsoring a resolution urging a ceasefire and protection for Ukrainian civilians. "My main task is to rule in Mexico; I will attend certain international events, which we consider important, but we will not travel much - our responsibility lies here," she stated, pointing to Mexico’s long-standing neutral and pacifist stance in global conflicts.

! Zelensky also expressed his hope that Mexico, under Sheinbaum’s leadership, would clearly distance itself from Russia.

However, Sheinbaum, set to become Mexico’s first female president on October 1, firmly rejected the invitation. He expressed disappointment over Mexico's inclusion of Russian military personnel in its Independence Day parade and called for recognition of Ukraine’s struggle for independence. "Our Constitution is very clear, noble, and pacifist," she said.

Throughout his tenure, current President Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) maintained a balanced stance on the Ukraine conflict, condemning Russia’s invasion while criticising the US for sending arms to Ukraine. Mexico has also refused to impose sanctions on Russia and declined to send military aid to Ukraine, despite requests from Ukrainian officials.

Nevertheless, it has played an active role in the United Nations, joining other countries in condemning Russia’s actions and co-sponsoring a resolution urging a ceasefire and protection for Ukrainian civilians. Domestically, however, support for the Kremlin has surfaced within Mexico’s governing Morena party, with some leftist members forming a "Mexico-Russia Friendship Committee" shortly after the war began.

Sheinbaum indicated that her administration would continue to focus on internal affairs, echoing AMLO’s approach of limited international travel."

 her intention to maintain a policy of non-intervention in foreign affairs, continuing the approach of her predecessor Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.

Mexico maintains diplomatic relations with both Russia and Ukraine and adheres to a policy of neutrality regarding the war.

Mexico’s President-elect Claudia Sheinbaum. Sheinbaum referred to an incident at the Mexican embassy in Ecuador in April as a “violation of sovereignty.” According to [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mexico-invites-putin-presidential-inauguration-russias-izvestia-newspaper-says-2024-08-06/)
, Mexico invited Russian President Vladimir Putin to Sheinbaum’s inauguration ceremony on 1 October.

The Ukrainian embassy in Mexico has [called](https://euromaidanpress.com/2024/08/08/ukraine-calls-on-mexico-to-arrest-putin-during-mexican-presidents-inauguration/?swcfpc=1)
 on local authorities to detain Putin if he visits, as Mexico recognizes the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court (ICC). We will attend some international events that we consider important, but we will not travel much,”_ Sheinbaum said, emphasizing that her administration’s main task will be addressing domestic issues.

The President-elect reaffirmed Mexico’s commitment to maintaining diplomatic relations with all countries, with the exception of Ecuador. On 8 August, European Commission spokesperson Peter Stano said that the European Union had also urged Mexico to arrest Putin if he arrives in the country.

Mexico has rejected a request from Ukraine to arrest the Russian President if he attends the inauguration of Mexico’s next president on 1 October.

In March 2023, the ICC issued an arrest warrant for Putin on charges of abducting and forcibly deporting Ukrainian children to Russia. Since then, the Russian leader has avoided traveling to countries that have signed the Rome Statute due to the threat of arrest.

She added that Mexico maintains diplomatic relations with all countries except Ecuador, where an embassy attack in April was deemed a “violation of sovereignty.”

In August, Russian media reported that Mexico had invited Russian dictator Vladimir Putin to Sheinbaum’s inauguration on October 1, 2024.

The Ukrainian Embassy in Mexico has urged Mexican authorities to arrest Putin if he visits, citing his war crimes indictment by the International Criminal Court, which Mexico recognizes.

López Obrador had previously rejected Ukraine’s request to arrest Putin.

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum [pointed that out last week](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mexican-president-tells-trump-tariffs-will-worsen-inflation-kill-jobs-2024-11-26/)
 in response to Trump’s claim that he’ll address this country’s fentanyl problem by putting a tariff on Mexican imports. 4, 2024, 6:06 PM EST

By [Julio Ricardo Varela](https://www.msnbc.com/author/julio-ricardo-varela-ncpn297186)
, MSNBC Columnist

Much of President-elect Donald Trump’s rise to power can be linked to [his blaming Mexico for America’s problems](https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-tariffs-mexico-president-claudia-sheinbaum-rcna181923)
. We do not consume synthetic drugs,” Sheinbaum said. When he launched his first presidential campaign in 2015, he claimed [Mexico was mostly “sending” criminals](https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/the-6-most-provocative-parts-donald-trumps-2016-announcement-msna619371)
, including drug dealers and rapists, to the U.S., and [he promised to build a wall](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-project-2025-immigration-mass-deportation-rcna179782)
 to keep migrants out. Now, his threat to [impose 25% tariffs on goods imported from Mexico and Canada](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-new-threats-day-one-trade-tariffs-matter-rcna181793)
 is based in part on the idea that Mexico is the cause of the United States’ fentanyl addiction and to blame for a migrant crisis.

Trump's talk of targeting Mexico is not only misguided, it’s downright reckless.

Trump's talk of targeting Mexico is not only misguided, it’s downright reckless. It riles up the nativism in his MAGA followers and gives them the scapegoat they crave.

But that ignores that the United States is the world’s most lucrative illegal drug market, [estimated at $150 billion yearly](https://www.rand.org/news/press/2019/08/20.html)
 for the most common drugs, along with an [increasing use of fentanyl](https://time.com/6977717/fentanyl-pills-seized-study/)
. “Unfortunately, what we do have is the people who are being killed by the crime that is responding to the demand in your country.”

Drugs aren’t the only thing that U.S. Mexico also has enforced new visa requirements for those from Brazil, Ecuador, and Venezuela, and increased expulsions.”

That all happened under then-Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, and his successor, Sheinbaum, [told Trump last week](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-mexico-president-sheinbaum-immigration-rcna182119)
 “that caravans weren’t arriving at the northern border because they are being served in Mexico.” In other words, Mexico continues to be the United States’ real southern border wall. This, despite Sheinbaum’s claim that “Mexico’s position is not to close borders but instead build bridges between government and people.” That might sound noble, but Mexico has benefited from being a complicit immigration enforcement partner with the U.S. That type of attitude led [to successes in decreasing drug fatalities](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-tariffs-overdose-opioid-epidemic-rcna182059)
 during the Biden administration."

Content: "‘war on drugs’ as poison to Mexico.

Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum made this statement — “Start with your own country” — during her regular morning press conference Feb. In the cities of the United States, who sells the drugs that have wreaked such tragedy?”

President Sheinbaum knows what she is talking about, especially if one considers who the big winner is in the drug business. The secrets of drug trafficking, from Colombia to Chicago” — states that there are some 20 million drug users in the United States, of which some 6 million are addicts; however, it is dangerous to talk about the subject, so it is avoided, leading to total ignorance and confusion and the easy construction of stereotypes aimed at blaming the scourge exclusively on the producing countries.

Fernández Menéndez and Ronquillo explain that, after the shipments have crossed the border using all kinds of transport and also through tunnels along the entire border area, the drug trafficking networks begin to operate from 14 cities in the south in the states of New Mexico, Texas, California, Arizona, Oklahoma, Florida and Louisiana, where the drugs are smuggled. In the continuation of the controversy and in defense of Mexico’s best interests, three days later Sheinbaum reiterated that the United States must take responsibility for the serious problem of drug trafficking and drug consumption in its country.

The Mexican president explained that drug trafficking arises from the demand for drugs; as long as there is consumption, there will be supply. In this area, she insisted that the United States must also take charge of controlling its own generators of violence and domestic production of psychotropic substances and must make an effort to monitor and intervene in its illegal internal market.

It must also be said Claudia Sheinbaum showed her indomitable will and patriotic feeling in the conversation she had with the U.S. 7, Sheinbaum reported that she told Trump that it was crucial in the fight against drug trafficking that weapons from the U.S. But today, there are several countries and governments that support and defend the dignity and honor of their peoples.

Claudia Sheinbaum, just like the priests Miguel Hidalgo and José María Morelos, just like Benito Juárez and Lázaro Cárdenas, is giving continuity to policies to recover decorum and consciousness of Mexican sovereignty initiated in this century by Andrés Manuel López Obrador. government’s use of the “war on drugs” as a pretext for intervention and exposes inconsistencies in Washington’s propaganda. The Mexican president then said: “They have a lot to do in the United States,” and asked, “How does fentanyl or any other drug get there? Already at the end of the 20th century, a study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) estimated the profit produced by international drug trafficking at close to $500 billion, more than half of which circulated through the U.S."

United States President Donald Trump thanked Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum on Wednesday for giving him the idea to launch an anti-drugs campaign, on which he pledged to spend “hundreds of millions of dollars.”

[Speaking at a Saudi Arabia-backed investment conference in Miami](https://x.com/jenarovillamil/status/1892377901682589986?s=46)
, Trump said he had spoken to Sheinbaum about drugs and she told him that Mexico is not a “consumer nation.”

> [#ULTIMAHORA](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ULTIMAHORA?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)
> . — his “sweeping freeze on foreign aid has temporarily stopped U.S.-funded anti-narcotics programs in Mexico that for years have been working to curb the flow of the synthetic opioid into the United States,” [Reuters said in an exclusive report last week](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trumps-foreign-aid-freeze-stops-anti-fentanyl-work-mexico-2025-02-13/)
.

**‘Fentanyl kills’: Mexico’s anti-drug campaign**
-------------------------------------------------

In early January, [Sheinbaum officially presented a 300-million-peso (US $14.8 million) “national” and “permanent” anti-drugs campaign](https://www.gob.mx/presidencia/prensa/presidenta-claudia-sheinbaum-presenta-campana-preventiva-nacional-y-permanente-alejate-de-las-drogas-el-fentanilo-te-mata)
 under the name “Aléjate de las drogas. (CBP Troy Miller/X)

The government of former president Andrés Manuel López Obrador [also ran an anti-drugs campaign](https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/fruitless-anti-drug-abuse-campaign/)
, and in early 2023 then deputy health minister Hugo López-Gatell was [announced as Mexico’s new addiction prevention “czar.”](https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/lopez-gatell-addiction-czar/)

The current and former anti-drugs campaigns have [faced criticism for a range of reasons](https://politica.expansion.mx/mexico/2025/02/10/campana-fentanilo-por-presion-sin-politica-innovadora)
, including because of the focus on fentanyl, which — as Sheinbaum has pointed out — is not widely used in Mexico, and because they have allegedly aroused interest in the synthetic opioid among users of other drugs.

“The main drug problem in Mexico is the use of methamphetamines,” [the news website Expansión reported earlier this month](https://politica.expansion.mx/mexico/2025/02/10/campana-fentanilo-por-presion-sin-politica-innovadora)
.

Health Minister David Kershenobich said last month that was “probably” the case, although he said that fentanyl “is the most significant” drug used in Mexico “in the sense of mortality and the harm it causes.”

Have something to say? President Donald Trump, who said Sheinbaum inspired his new anti-drug campaign](https://mexiconewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/sheinbaum-trump-696x464.jpg "sheinbaum-trump")](https://mexiconewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/sheinbaum-trump.jpg)

Despite her status as 'the world's leading Trump whisperer,' President Sheinbaum and U.S. We have great family values,'” Trump said.

He noted that Sheinbaum — who he referred to as a “very wonderful woman” — also told him that Mexico spends a lot of money on anti-drug advertising.

“And I said ‘unbelievable.’ That was such a great conversation because we’re going to spend hundreds of millions of dollars advertising how bad drugs are so that kids don’t use them — \[we’re going to say\] that they chew up your brain, they destroy your teeth, your skin, your everything. … We’re going to do a great advertising campaign saying how bad it is, how drugs are so bad for you,” he said.

Trump didn’t say exactly when he spoke to Sheinbaum about Mexico’s anti-drug advertising campaign.

Sheinbaum [said on social media in late November](https://mexiconewsdaily.com/politics/sheinbaum-responds-trump-claim-stop-migration-close-border/)
 that she had spoken to Trump about “the campaign we’re carrying out in the country to prevent the use of fentanyl.”

The U.S. Stay away from drugs, choose to be happy,” [says one video advertisement](https://x.com/SSalud_mx/status/1890611998871704013/video/1)
.

On the day the “Stay away from drugs campaign” was officially launched, [Sheinbaum asserted that the use of fentanyl “is not really a problem” in Mexico](https://mexiconewsdaily.com/politics/mexico-sheinbaum-fentanyl/)
.

While [fentanyl is used in Mexico](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/fentanyl-use-spreads-deeper-into-mexico-worrying-authorities-2024-02-20/)
 and there have been deaths linked to the powerful synthetic opioid here, “there is not a crisis like there is in the United States,” she said.

“… We don’t want \[the overdose crisis\] to reach our country, and that’s why we’re starting this campaign against fentanyl,” Sheinbaum said.

_Sign up to receive CFR President Mike Froman’s analysis on the most important foreign policy story of the week, delivered to your inbox every Friday. commitment has been called into question in 2025, with President Donald Trump freezing all military aid to Ukraine in early March, and then lifting the freeze shortly after, following cease-fire talks in Saudi Arabia.

This has been a familiar dynamic for the administration; in early July, the White House announced it would freeze the delivery of some weapons intended for Ukraine. Dozens of other countries, including most members of the [North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/what-nato "North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)")
 and European Union (EU), are also providing large aid packages to Ukraine.

In late 2024, the United States also provided the Ukrainian government with a $20 billion loan, funded by interest generated from frozen Russian assets.

The Ukrainian government has received most, but not all, of the funding in the five U.S. supplemental appropriations bills passed since the invasion.

A large share of the money in the aid bills has been spent in the United States, paying for American factories and workers to produce the various weapons that are either shipped to Ukraine or that replenish the U.S. cities.

The $128 billion figure counts committed aid, much of which has yet to be delivered, according to an [analysis](https://www.csis.org/analysis/ukraine-now-doomed "analysis")

Why has the United States provided aid to Ukraine?
--------------------------------------------------

Much of the U.S. Many Western analysts say the military aid provided by the United States and other allies has played a pivotal role in Ukraine’s defense and counteroffensive against Russia. Military Support for Taiwan: Five Charts](https://www.cfr.org/article/us-military-support-taiwan-five-charts)

What weapons and equipment has the United States sent Ukraine?
--------------------------------------------------------------

NATO allies are particularly wary of being pulled directly into the hostilities, which could dramatically raise the [risk of a nuclear war](https://www.cfr.org/article/if-russia-goes-nuclear-three-scenarios-ukraine-war "risk of a nuclear war")
. In addition, after widely broadcast friction between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a February 28 Oval Office visit, European nations such as France, Germany, and the United Kingdom have all stepped up pledges of support. 

For nearly three years of war, the United States has provided or agreed to provide Ukraine with a long list of defense capabilities."

Critical Questions by Mark F. While much is unclear about the new policy, it appears NATO member states will send weapons from their stockpiles to Ukraine and buy U.S. Separately, the Trump administration this week announced weapons sales to Ukraine totaling $652 million under the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program, adding to the $310 million in FMS approved in May. The Trump administration policy appears to keep in place the military aid committed under the Biden administration, which is set to deliver around $30 billion over the next three-and-a-half years.

**US philanthropist Howard Buffett has kept up funding Ukraine with informal arrangements, even amidst deteriorating relations between the two nations since President Donald Trump’s election into office.** 

The son of billionaire Warren Buffett and longtime Republican Party supporter made his 18th visit to Ukraine in three years via a train trip in April, underscoring his funding support. 

Buffett told the Associated Press that Trump’s apparent closeness with Russia and clampdown on military support for Ukraine has not altered his foundation’s support in Ukraine. 

‘It doesn’t change anything we do. Howard Buffett maintains Ukraine philanthropy despite deteriorating US support 
===============================================================================

! We’re on track,’ he said. 

Howard Buffett’s foundation aims to surpass the $1 billion giving mark this year for Ukraine. 

So far, the Buffett Foundation has provided $800 million in aid and funding towards clearing mines and boosting agriculture and local infrastructure. A similar trip is expected in May. 

In a video posted by the Associated Press, Buffett was joined by Ukraine’s Economy Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko. The pair have established close relations, with Svyrydenko describing Buffett as ‘one of the greatest friends of Ukraine.’ 

Buffett also scorned the possibility of a peace deal, calling it ‘impossible’ given Trump’s pivoting towards the Kremlin and Putin’s reluctance. 

“At the end of the day, I think the US will do the right thing, but it may be a painful process and there may be a lot more Ukrainians that die,” he said.

Ukraine’s agricultural sector has lost 20.5 per cent of farmland since the full-scale invasion in February 2022.  

And some 139,000 square kilometres of land — about the size of the state of New York — are potentially mined. Two-thirds of that is fertile farmland belonging to Ukrainian farmers who have sowed wheat for generations. 

The foundation also funded bipartisan trips for US lawmakers to visit Ukraine in 2023."

 As uncertainty in U.S.–Ukraine relations grows, informal ties with some U.S. Buffett, a Republican and son of billionaire investor Warren Buffett. We’re on track,” Buffett told The Associated Press, adding that his foundation will surpass $1 billion in aid to Ukraine this year. So, we’ll stick with it as long as we need to.”

The AP caught up with Buffett aboard a train with Ukraine’s Economy Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko on Saturday. Svyrydenko calls him “one of the greatest friends of Ukraine.”

Buffett is [among a number of Americans](https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-russia-war-be08b99bf75e99de991557ac18c7bf15)
 across the U.S. hasn’t done enough to help Ukraine defeat Russia over the past few years.

On this trip, Buffett and Svyrydenko traveled to the country’s northern Sumy region, where the situation has significantly worsened following Ukrainian forces’ loss of ground in Russia’s Kursk region.

They visited the villages of Popivka and Bobryk, which — like much of the region — lie in a high-risk zone for land mines. They also stopped at a local school that had been relocated to a basement, where children now study during hours-long air raid alerts.

Buffett’s foundation, which focuses on humanitarian needs like agriculture, infrastructure and mine clearance, has contributed about $800 million to Ukraine since the start of the full-scale invasion, including $175 million in humanitarian demining. Svyrydenko’s ministry is responsible for Ukraine’s humanitarian demining infrastructure.

“He understands very well that if a country that can feed 400 million people cannot clear its fields and loses at least $12 billion of GDP every year due to mined land, it’s a major challenge,” Svyrydenko said of Buffett.

According to Ukraine’s Ministry of Economy, the country’s [agricultural sector](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-business-africa-lifestyle-middle-east-1b41faaa7ac0984d0673023b68d39a70)
 has lost 20.5% of its farmland since the invasion — due to land mines, occupation and ongoing fighting.

Roughly 139,000 square kilometers (53,670 square miles) of Ukrainian land — about the size of the state of New York — are potentially mined."

Warren Buffett's son Howard has given $500M to Ukraine — he warns the US is making a historic mistake by pulling its support
============================================================================================================================

By [Rebecca Rommen](https://www.businessinsider.com/author/rebecca-rommen)

!Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Howard Buffett in Kyiv, Ukraine. Log in.

*   Business Insider interviewed Warren Buffett's son about his  support for Ukraine. 
*   Howard Buffett's foundation has given $520 million to Ukraine in humanitarian aid.
*   The philanthropist warns the US will make a historic blunder if it fails to support Ukraine's war effort.

Two years after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the embattled nation needs its friends more than ever.

Russia celebrated [a landmark victory](https://www.businessinsider.com/ukraine-troops-pull-out-key-eastern-town-avdiivka-russia-2024-2?r=US&IR=T)
 when it captured the eastern town of Avdiivka last week, and it is [running low on artillery ammunition.](https://www.businessinsider.com/ukraines-ammo-problems-hinder-ability-fire-at-russian-targets-2024-2?r=US&IR=T)
 Meanwhile, a $60 billion military aid package is snarled up in Congress due to opposition from some Republican Party lawmakers.

But Howard Buffett, the elder son of Warren, the billionaire investor and Berkshire Hathaway CEO, has no intention of forsaking Ukraine or its President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

The wartime leader and American philanthropist have a profound mutual respect.

Buffett told Business Insider, "There are very few people in the world that could step up" and do what Zelenskyy's done. And it's going to be one of the biggest mistakes that the United States makes historically if we don't continue to support Ukraine.

"The most frustrating part is to watch the narrative in the US because you have congressmen and senators whose constituencies or districts are benefiting from this war," he said.

Putting his money where his mouth is, Buffett said another $300 million is budgeted for Ukraine this year, and for the last two years, the foundation exceeded the budgeted number.

The foundation is largely funded by his father, Warren Buffett's contributions. [Warren Buffett is the seventh richest person](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/?embedded-checkout=true)
 in the world, boasting a net worth of $138 billion.

'You have to step up big'

In December, [Zelenskyy and Howard Buffett visited a Kyiv plaza](https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/volodimir-zelenskij-i-govard-baffet-vidkrili-na-aleyi-smiliv-87821)
 adorned with plaques honoring Ukraine's most steadfast supporters during Russia's full-scale invasion to show the US philanthropist that his name is also etched on the "Walk of the Brave."

Zelenskyy told Buffett: "You are among these world leaders — friends of Ukraine."

Buffett calls the war the "largest humanitarian crisis" that he's witnessed in his lifetime.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Buffett Foundation has emerged as a stalwart ally to Ukraine since Russia's full-scale invasion, injecting $521,779,225 into humanitarian assistance for Ukraine as of January 2024.

The US and its 'Ukraine fatigue' problem
----------------------------------------

"The guy's got to be worn out," Buffett said of Zelenskyy. So to me, he's somebody who has stepped up and done a job that I think very few people could do," said Buffett.

"I don't think anybody could have done a better job," he said, observing that "it's an incredible force that he's up against."

While Buffett worries about Zelenskyy's exhausting schedule and sleepless nights, he is also concerned about "Ukraine fatigue" affecting its most important ally, the United States.

He warned against it last year and continues stressing the importance of supporting the war effort.

Russian propaganda portrays Zelenskyy as supervillain

Russian propaganda portrays Zelenskyy as supervillain

Print

In the fictional world of Russia's decadeslong disinformation campaign, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is a corrupt owner of multimillion-dollar villas, cars, yachts and other luxury goods purchased using the West's financial aid, particularly the U.S. Yet the Russian-cooked list of Zelenskyy's evil traits keeps growing.

Most recently, the Kremlin's news sites, newspapers and social media accounts accused Zelenskyy of monopolizing the funeral industry in Ukraine by trademarking his last name.

Russia's state news agency RIA Novosti cited the Ukrainian president's October 2022 registration of the "ZELENSKYY" trademark with the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), suggesting that he was entering the funeral business.

Major Russian state-owned and pro-Kremlin media outlets followed with publications misleadingly claiming that Zelenskyy registered a trademark to take over the funeral business in his war-torn country and profit from the deaths of thousands of Ukrainians.

WIPO, which registered the ZELENSKYY trademark, is a United Nations agency that protects intellectual property worldwide under various classes of the Nice Classification. naturalization certificate for Zelenskyy was fabricated and the Florida property was still for sale. Kremlin propaganda has included false stories of Zelenskyy buying yachts and preparing to flee his country for the U.S. He is also a Nazi drug addict alcoholic who kills investigative journalists, represses ethnic minorities and is a mass murderer who attacked Russia and refuses to stop the war while cynically profiting from Ukrainian deaths.

The Kremlin's propaganda portrayal of Zelenskyy is the epitome of a disinformation tactic dubbed "projection" — that is when one side projects on the opposing side its own crimes and characteristics. In this case, Russia's President Vladimir Putin stands verifiably accused of committing all sorts of crimes that his propaganda machine projects onto Zelenskyy.

Investigative journalists and fact-checkers, including VOA's, have been looking into the Kremlin's claims about the Ukrainian president and proving them false. While the Russian disinformation agents focused on funeral services, that is only one of thousands of different goods and services covered in a standard trademark registration.

Before becoming Ukraine's president in 2019, Zelenskyy worked in television and is the founder of Kvartal 95, a video production company with multimillion-dollar annual profits. In 2016, the streaming service Netflix bought the rights to broadcast the TV show "Servant of the People," produced by Zelenskyy's company."

An English-language fake is spreading on Facebook - President Volodymyr Zelensky allegedly bought a residence in Florida for $ 35 million, which the United States has allocated to help Ukraine in the war with Russia. Check Your Fact denied this information, noting that there was no evidence that Zelensky had bought the property and that the house was still up for sale. There are no signs that he has been sold, " the fact-checkers said, recalling that Zelensky had rejected a US proposal to evacuate the capital Kyiv after a full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine.

This fake is aimed at American users because it contains manipulation and lies about buying property: they say that the Ukrainian president paid for the villa from "their taxes." It is not the first time Russian propaganda has tried to discredit Zelensky in the eyes of the foreign community."

A right-wing activist and failed U.S. Johns counties do not list Zelenskyy as a property owner in either location.

The Ponte Vedra Beach home was being auctioned on Feb. The document shown in the post is missing [Zelenskyy’s middle name of Oleksandrovych](https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/29/europe/volodymyr-zelensky-fast-facts/index.html)

On February 20, during the broadcast of “New Paradigm,” host Tengo Omanadze spoke about the increase in President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s wealth during the Russia-Ukraine war \[[52:40](https://www.facebook.com/100064835944683/videos/1031699295465330)\
\]. According to Zelenskyy’s financial declarations, his income decreased after the war began, and his family’s financial situation was affected by the temporary suspension of rental income from real estate. Moreover, according to Forbes and Bloomberg, Ivanishvili’s wealth has increased compared to the beginning of the war.**

*   #### **Did Zelenskyy’s Income Increase or Decrease After the War Began?**
    

Before entering politics, Volodymyr Zelenskyy was a successful actor and producer, accumulating his wealth while working in the entertainment industry before becoming president. Thus, the increase in Zelenskyy’s family income compared to the previous year was linked to the resumption of rental payments.

Regarding savings, financial declarations show that the family’s cash reserves have gradually decreased. By the end of 2022, their savings had dropped by approximately 1.8 million hryvnias, and by the end of 2023, they had [decreased](https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-publishes-declaration-unveiling-more-than-317-000-of-income-for-his-family-in-2023/)
 by another 2.8 million hryvnias (about $71,000).

It is notable that Zelenskyy’s financial situation has not changed significantly since becoming president. According to the latest available Forbes data from 2022, his net worth is [less](https://www.logicallyfacts.com/en/fact-check/false-ukraine-president-volodymyr-zelenskyy-s-net-worth-is-over-500-million?u)
 than $30 million. While this is a substantial amount, it is not surprising in the case of Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as he was a successful actor and producer.

The real estate owned by Zelenskyy and his family has remained practically unchanged during his presidency. Myth Detector has published multiple reports debunking such claims:

As the war in Ukraine rages on, rumors abound online regarding Zelenskyy’s net worth, including assets such as homes and vehicles. The site says that the president’s financial disclosure from 2018 listed total assets worth 37 million hryvnias, Ukrainian currency. He graduated from Kryvyi Rih Institute of Economics with a law degree, but never practiced, according to ClutchPoints.

Thanks for signing up.

Thank you for signing up. Some news sources speculate that tweets declaring the former comedian’s net worth at $1.5 billion were efforts to undermine support for Zelenskyy and Ukraine.

### So how much is Zelenskyy really worth?

According to Celebrity Net Worth, Zelenskyy is worth roughly $1.5 million — not $1.5 billion. At the time, that gave him a net worth of $1.5 million USD, although, due to foreign exchange rates, the amount fluctuates.

Zelenskyy earned most of his money as a Ukrainian entertainer, starring in Russian-language films including “Love in the Big City,” “Office Romance,” and “8 First Dates.” The tri-lingual president, who is fluent in Russian, Ukrainian, and English, also dubbed the Ukrainian voiceovers for “Paddington”and “Paddington 2.”

From 2015 to 2019, he starred in a political satire comedy series, “Servant of the People.” The oddly prophetic show, which aired for 51 episodes, chronicled the adventures of a high school teacher turned president of Ukraine. In 2019, Zelenskyy ran for office and was elected as president.

Although this marked Zelenskyy’s first foray into politics, he does have the education to back up his recent career change."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence contradicts the claim. Multiple sources debunk the claim that Zelenskyy owns a $35 million home in Florida, with some sources explicitly stating he does not own property there. Furthermore, the evidence indicates that Zelenskyy's net worth is significantly less than $1.2 billion. One source estimates his net worth to be less than $30 million, while another states it is approximately $1.5 million.

The evidence also contradicts the claim about Zelenskyy's monthly income. One source states his annual salary is approximately $11,200, which is far less than the claimed $11 million monthly income. The evidence does not mention the number of homes or private planes owned by Zelenskyy, but it does debunk claims about expensive property purchases.

In conclusion, the evidence strongly suggests that the claim is false, as it exaggerates Zelenskyy's wealth and property ownership.

----------- So they’re in the process of setting it up and we’re going to see what happens.”

Trump’s reluctance to push Putin and Zelenskyy to a meeting comes as he has acknowledged in recent days that ending the war in Ukraine has been more difficult than he had anticipated, after [saying on the campaign trail](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/25/politics/fact-check-trump-ukraine-war)
 last year he could achieve it in 24 hours.

He has since sought a quick peace agreement after his deadline for Russia to end the war expired this month and said after his [meetings with Zelenskyy and European leaders](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/18/trump-zelenskyy-meeting-ukraine-putin)
 at the White House on Monday that he had initiated steps for a bilateral meeting.

A senior administration official characterized the situation as Trump taking a “wait-and-see approach” to whether a Putin-Zelenskyy meeting could be scheduled. Putin’s foreign policy aide, Yuri Ushakov, later said the two leaders agreed that more senior negotiators would be appointed for direct talks between Russia and [Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine)
.

That statement signaled that a bilateral meeting could remain some way off, even as the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, expressed optimism it could happen within two weeks and Putin has rejected previous attempts by Zelenskyy to meet face-to-face since the start of the war.

At a news conference on Monday night after the White House meetings, Zelenskyy said that the European leaders’ meeting with Trump centered on security guarantees for Ukraine in any peace agreement to ensure Russia did not resume its invasion.

Trump offered to contribute to security guarantees, but has since [ruled out deploying US troops](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/19/european-leaders-ukraine-russia-trump)

Trump steps back from Russia and Ukraine peace talks for now, sources say
=========================================================================

US president told top advisers trilateral meeting would take place after leaders of the two countries have met first

[Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump)
 intends to leave Russia and Ukraine to organize a meeting between their leaders without directly playing a role for now, according to administration officials familiar with the situation, taking a step back from the negotiations to end Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

The next stage in Trump’s eyes to end the war in Ukraine remains a bilateral meeting between Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, and [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://www.theguardian.com/world/volodymyr-zelenskiy)
, the Ukrainian president, the officials said.

Trump has told advisers in recent days that he intends to host a trilateral meeting with the two leaders only after they have met first, although whether that initial conference takes place remains unclear and Trump does not intend to become involved in that effort.

In a phone interview with talk show host Mark Levin on WABC on Tuesday, Trump also said he thought it would be better for Putin and Zelenskyy to meet without him in the first instance. But there have been few tangible signs in recent days of progress and the White House does not have a shortlist of locations where the meeting could take place.

In a statement, the White House said: “Trump and his national security team continue to engage with Russian and Ukranian officials towards a bilateral meeting to stop the killing and end the war… It is not in the national interest to further negotiate these issues publicly.”

After the meetings at the White House, Trump spoke to Putin on a call that lasted around 40 minutes. Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, has also suggested that Russia should be one of the security guarantors for Ukraine – a proposal the White House has privately scoffed at, one official said.

“The Ukrainian side proposed, and our delegation at that time agreed, to work out security guarantees that would involve all permanent members of the UN security council – that is, Russia, the People’s Republic of China, the United States, France, and the United Kingdom,” Lavrov said.

After the White House meetings, Zelenskyy also outlined a plan to purchase $90bn in American weapons through Europe to win security guarantees, and for the US to buy drones from Ukraine. [Skip to main content](#maincontent)

Trump and Zelenskyy at the White House on Monday, 18 August 2025, in Washington. Any US assistance is expected to come in the form of intelligence sharing or possibly US air support.

Previously, Steve Witkoff, Trump’s special envoy, had said on CNN’s “state of the union” after the Trump-Putin summit in Alaska that Putin agreed the US could offer Ukraine a security guarantee that resembled Nato’s Article 5 collective self-defense mandate.

“We were able to win the following concession: that the United States could offer Article 5-like protection, which is one of the real reasons why Ukraine wants to be in Nato,” Witkoff said.

But Putin’s acceptance of Nato-like security guarantees may not be as straightforward."

Ukraine's president [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy "Volodymyr Zelenskyy")
, Foreign Minister [Dmytro Kuleba](/wiki/Dmytro_Kuleba "Dmytro Kuleba")
, and Head of the Presidential Office, [Andriy Yermak](/wiki/Andriy_Yermak "Andriy Yermak")

Ukrainian president [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy "Volodymyr Zelenskyy")
 proposed in November 2022 a 10-point peace plan,[\[26\]](#cite_note-kp10point-26)
[\[27\]](#cite_note-ajz1-27)
[\[28\]](#cite_note-28)
 consisting of:

*   A ceasefire and withdrawal of Russian military forces from Ukraine
*   Restoration of Ukraine's borders prior to the 2014 annexation of Crimea
*   Release of prisoners and return of [Ukrainian children deported to Russia](/wiki/Child_abductions_in_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War "Child abductions in the Russo-Ukrainian War")
    
*   Protection and restoration of [Ukraine's energy infrastructure](/wiki/Russian_strikes_against_Ukrainian_infrastructure_(2022%E2%80%93present) "Russian strikes against Ukrainian infrastructure (2022–present)")
    
*   Protection of [food distribution](/wiki/2022%E2%80%932023_food_crises#Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine "2022–2023 food crises")
    
*   Nuclear safety, including transfer of [Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant](/wiki/Zaporizhzhia_Nuclear_Power_Plant_crisis "Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant crisis")
     to the [IAEA](/wiki/International_Atomic_Energy_Agency "International Atomic Energy Agency")
    
*   Environmental safety, including [demining](/wiki/Demining "Demining")
     and remediation of ecological damage caused by the [destruction of the Kakhovka Dam](/wiki/Destruction_of_the_Kakhovka_Dam "Destruction of the Kakhovka Dam")
    
*   Prosecution of [Russian war crimes](/wiki/War_crimes_in_the_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine "War crimes in the Russian invasion of Ukraine")
    
*   Security guarantees for Ukraine to prevent future aggression
*   A multilateral peace conference and peace treaty

Two months before the invasion, Ukrainian Foreign Minister [Dmytro Kuleba](/wiki/Dmytro_Kuleba "Dmytro Kuleba")
 dismissed the idea that declaring [neutrality](/wiki/Neutral_country "Neutral country")
 would prevent Russian aggression. The agreement was however blocked by Putin, who "expanded his objectives to include annexing swathes of Ukrainian territory".[\[21\]](#cite_note-Reuters14092022-21)
 A Kremlin spokesman denied the story.[\[47\]](#cite_note-moscowtimes-deal-47)

### Belarus and Antalya peace talks

Ukrainian president [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy "Volodymyr Zelenskyy")
 and Belarusian president [Alexander Lukashenko](/wiki/Alexander_Lukashenko "Alexander Lukashenko")
 agreed on 27 February that a Ukrainian delegation would meet with Russian officials in Belarus, near the Ukrainian border, without preconditions.[\[48\]](#cite_note-48)
 It was reported that Lukashenko assured Zelenskyy that all planes, helicopters, and missiles on Belarusian territory would remain on the ground during the negotiations.[\[49\]](#cite_note-49)

Talks began on 28 February at one of Lukashenko's countryside residences near Liaskavičy, about 30 miles from the [Belarus-Ukraine border](/wiki/Belarus-Ukraine_border "Belarus-Ukraine border")
.[\[42\]](#cite_note-ForeignAffairs_CharapRadchenko2024-42)
 The Ukrainian delegation was led by [Davyd Arakhamia](/wiki/Davyd_Arakhamia "Davyd Arakhamia")
 and included defense minister [Oleksii Reznikov](/wiki/Oleksii_Reznikov "Oleksii Reznikov")
, presidential adviser [Mykhailo Podolyak](/wiki/Mykhailo_Podolyak "Mykhailo Podolyak")
, and others. The Ukrainians wanted a peacetime army of 250,000; the Russians demanded a maximum of 85,000, which is much smaller than the standing army Ukraine had before the invasion.[\[42\]](#cite_note-ForeignAffairs_CharapRadchenko2024-42)
 The Russians also demanded severe limits on the amount and kinds of weaponry Ukraine could have, without any limits on Russia's military.[\[42\]](#cite_note-ForeignAffairs_CharapRadchenko2024-42)

A third disagreement was the Russians' new demands for Ukraine to revoke several of its domestic laws, dealing with [contentious aspects of Soviet-era history](/wiki/Decolonization_in_Ukraine "Decolonization in Ukraine")
, such as the role of Ukrainian nationalists in World War II. Secretary of State [Antony Blinken](/wiki/Antony_Blinken "Antony Blinken")
 insisted that Ukraine continue fighting in response to Milley's statement.[\[128\]](#cite_note-128)
 Ukraine presented the detailed [10-point peace proposal](/wiki/Ukraine%27s_Peace_Formula "Ukraine's Peace Formula")
 later in November at a [G20](/wiki/G20 "G20")
 meeting.[\[129\]](#cite_note-AJE_Zelenskyy_10pt_plan-129)
 In December, Ukrainian foreign minister [Dmytro Kuleba](/wiki/Dmytro_Kuleba "Dmytro Kuleba")
 suggested a February 2023 peace summit at the UN mediated by secretary-general [António Guterres](/wiki/Ant%C3%B3nio_Guterres "António Guterres")
 to which Russia would only be invited if it faced an international court for war crimes.[\[130\]](#cite_note-ap221226-130)
 Later that month, Russian officials said it would only resume peace talks with Ukraine if it recognized Russian sovereignty over the annexed regions.[\[22\]](#cite_note-voa221230-22)
[\[131\]](#cite_note-131)
 Peskov said in January 2023 that "there is currently no prospect for diplomatic means of settling the situation around Ukraine."[\[132\]](#cite_note-132)

In February 2023, at the [59th Munich Security Conference](/wiki/59th_Munich_Security_Conference "59th Munich Security Conference")
, Chinese foreign policy chief [Wang Yi](/wiki/Wang_Yi "Wang Yi")
 said Chinese leader [Xi Jinping](/wiki/Xi_Jinping "Xi Jinping")
 would present a peace proposal for the war in Ukraine.[\[133\]](#cite_note-133)
[\[134\]](#cite_note-134)
 On 24 February, China's government published a 12-point paper of "[China's Position on the Political Settlement of the Ukraine Crisis](/wiki/China%27s_Position_on_the_Political_Settlement_of_the_Ukrainian_Crisis "China's Position on the Political Settlement of the Ukrainian Crisis")
", receiving mixed responses from Western leaders.[\[135\]](#cite_note-135)
[\[136\]](#cite_note-136)
[\[137\]](#cite_note-137)
 At the [UN General Assembly](/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly "United Nations General Assembly")
, China's deputy ambassador to the UN proposed a plan involving a ceasefire, dialogue, security guarantees for Russia, protection of civilians, and the upholding of territorial integrity; China also said that the West had exacerbated the conflict by supplying Ukraine with weaponry.[\[138\]](#cite_note-138)
[\[139\]](#cite_note-139)
 Zelenskyy said that "I plan to meet Xi Jinping and believe this will be beneficial for our countries and for security in the world", though a time or place for a meeting was not set.[\[140\]](#cite_note-140)
 The spokeswoman of Russia's foreign ministry, [Maria Zakharova](/wiki/Maria_Zakharova "Maria Zakharova")
, said Russia appreciated China's efforts to resolve the conflict and was "open to achieving the goals of the [special military operation](/wiki/Special_military_operation "Special military operation")
 by political and diplomatic means" but that it would entail recognising the "new territorial realities" of Russia's annexations.[\[141\]](#cite_note-141)
 Peskov said that for now, we don't see any of the conditions that are needed to bring this whole story towards peace."[\[142\]](#cite_note-chinese-peskov-142)

 with Putin during Xi's [2023 visit to Russia](/wiki/2023_visit_by_Xi_Jinping_to_Russia "2023 visit by Xi Jinping to Russia")

Chinese foreign minister [Qin Gang](/wiki/Qin_Gang "Qin Gang")
 said sanctions and political pressure would not resolve the conflict, which he said "seems to be driven by an invisible hand pushing for the protraction and escalation", and that "the process of peace talks should begin as soon as possible".[\[143\]](#cite_note-143)
 Xi said that China's peace proposal reflected world opinion ahead of [his visit to Russia on 20–22 March 2023](/wiki/2023_visit_by_Xi_Jinping_to_Russia "2023 visit by Xi Jinping to Russia")
.[\[144\]](#cite_note-144)
 Blinken responded by saying "the world should not be fooled by any tactical move by Russia, supported by China or any other country, to freeze the war on its own terms."[\[145\]](#cite_note-guardian230321-145)
 On 26 April 2023, over a month after Xi's summit with Putin, Xi Jinping held a phone call with Zelenskyy.[\[146\]](#cite_note-146)
 The Chinese readout of the Xi–Zelenskyy call included little concrete information about the start of a peace process;[\[147\]](#cite_note-147)
 in May, European officials criticized China's peace plan as an attempt at "freezing" the conflict in place and splitting the West in pushing Ukraine to a ceasefire.[\[148\]](#cite_note-wsj230526-148)
 Earlier, Peskov had said that Russia has "to achieve our goals" and that "Right now this is only possible by military means."[\[149\]](#cite_note-149)

In April 2023, some Ukrainian officials said they would be willing to discuss the status of Crimea.[\[150\]](#cite_note-150)
[\[151\]](#cite_note-foreignpol230411-151)
 That month, Brazilian president [Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva](/wiki/Luiz_In%C3%A1cio_Lula_da_Silva "Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva")
 suggested that Ukraine should "give up Crimea" in exchange for Russian withdrawal from all territory it has occupied since February 2022.[\[152\]](#cite_note-:15-152)
 Lula condemned Russia's violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity but said that Zelenskyy "cannot want everything";[\[152\]](#cite_note-:15-152)
[\[153\]](#cite_note-153)
 he said Brazil advocates a "negotiated political solution to the conflict" and expressed concern over "global consequences" of the war "in terms of [food](/wiki/2022%E2%80%932023_global_food_crises "2022–2023 global food crises")
 and energy security".[\[154\]](#cite_note-aljazeera-brazil-154)
 Brazilian foreign policy adviser [Celso Amorim](/wiki/Celso_Amorim "Celso Amorim")
 said "the ideal peace for the Ukrainians and the Russians" required "concessions".[\[154\]](#cite_note-aljazeera-brazil-154)
 Ukraine rejected Lula's proposal.[\[155\]](#cite_note-155)
 Lula said after visiting China that "the United States needs to stop encouraging war and start talking about peace", to which U.S. Petersburg, Russian president Vladimir Putin rejected a ceasefire and peace talks with Ukraine due to the ongoing [Ukrainian counter-offensive](/wiki/2023_Ukrainian_counteroffensive "2023 Ukrainian counteroffensive")
 against Russian forces in [Russia-occupied](/wiki/Russian-occupied_territories_of_Ukraine "Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine")
 southeastern Ukraine, saying "We cannot cease fire when we are under attack."[\[180\]](#cite_note-180)

 focusing on Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy's proposed peace plan.[\[181\]](#cite_note-SAsummit286936-181)
[\[182\]](#cite_note-182)
 Russia did not participate in the talks.[\[181\]](#cite_note-SAsummit286936-181)
 Prior to the summit [Andriy Yermak](/wiki/Andriy_Yermak "Andriy Yermak")
, Zelenskyy's chief of staff, said there would be discussions on the Ukrainian Peace Formula, which "contains 10 fundamental points, the implementation of which will not only ensure peace for Ukraine, but also create mechanisms to counter future conflicts in the world".[\[183\]](#cite_note-183)
 After the summit no joint statement was issued.[\[181\]](#cite_note-SAsummit286936-181)
 The participants did agree to create working groups to develop details of key themes prominent in Zelenskyy's proposed peace plan (that calls for Russian troops to withdraw from all of Ukraine's territory as part of a peace deal) while a parallel ambassadors group would continue technical work on the issues.[\[181\]](#cite_note-SAsummit286936-181)

On 27 September 2023, Russian Foreign Minister [Sergey Lavrov](/wiki/Sergey_Lavrov "Sergey Lavrov")
 said in an interview with [TASS](/wiki/TASS "TASS")
 that Russia was "ready to make agreements" on Ukraine if they would "take the situation on the ground" and Russian security interests into account.[\[184\]](#cite_note-Lav1681505-184)
 According to Lavrov one of the Russian security interest was "the need to prevent the creation of a hostile Nazi regime near Russian borders."[\[184\]](#cite_note-Lav1681505-184)
 Lavrov also said that Russia did not see "any serious proposals from the West" and he argued that they were promoting [Ukrainian president](/wiki/Ukrainian_president "Ukrainian president")
 Volodymyr Zelenskyy ['peace formula'](#September_2022)
 as "the sole basis for negotiations" and that there was "no point in discussing it as it is nothing but an ultimatum."[\[184\]](#cite_note-Lav1681505-184)
 Lavrov also praised the [June 2023 African](#June_2023)

, [Brazilian](#April_2023)

[Slovakia](/wiki/Slovakia "Slovakia")

 said that sending more and more [weapons to Ukraine](/wiki/List_of_military_aid_to_Ukraine_during_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War "List of military aid to Ukraine during the Russo-Ukrainian War")
 has only encouraged more killings and endless war, and instead efforts should be made to reach a cease-fire and push Russia and Ukraine toward peace talks. Both countries reportedly planned to send delegations to talks mediated by Qatari officials, but Russian officials postponed the meeting after Ukraine's offensive.[\[234\]](#cite_note-washingtonpost-qatar-234)
 Ukrainian officials told _[The Washington Post](/wiki/The_Washington_Post "The Washington Post")

 Some officials had hoped the talks could be the first step toward a comprehensive peace deal.[\[234\]](#cite_note-washingtonpost-qatar-234)
 Putin said one week after the Kursk offensive began that he would not negotiate with Ukraine.[\[235\]](#cite_note-euractiv-qatar-235)

In September 2024, Zelenskyy proposed U.S. Many of these resources remain unexploited, while some deposits are located in territories occupied by Russia.[\[237\]](#cite_note-Abdurasulov_202502263-237)
 The next month, Zelenskyy unveiled the [Victory Plan for Ukraine](/wiki/Victory_Plan_for_Ukraine "Victory Plan for Ukraine")
,[\[238\]](#cite_note-238)
 which sought to solve to the conflict with Russia and describe future national defense guarantees.[\[239\]](#cite_note-239)
 The plan's official goal is "to change the circumstances in such a way that Russia will be forced to peace".[\[240\]](#cite_note-240)
 It outlined strategies to strengthen Ukraine and potentially end the war, including a renewed request for inclusion in NATO and a robust post-war security framework, assistance in deterring Russian aggression, and a "special agreement on joint investment and use" of Ukraine's natural resources—such as uranium, titanium, and lithium—with the [European Union](/wiki/European_Union "European Union")

US President [Donald Trump](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/trump-ukraine-russia-zelensky-putin-08-19-25)
 has ditched his call for a ceasefire in Ukraine, backing instead Russian President Vladimir Putin’s push for a permanent peace agreement. And my response to that is: That’s the point,” Pizzi said.

Ad Feedback But they understand that the kind of deal sought by Russia can’t happen unless the most basic principle underpinning the global order – that a country cannot get what it wants by force – is thrown under the bus.

And Kyiv’s European allies are not willing to risk that, not least because they could well become the next target of Russia’s aggression.

Speaking to the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and several European leaders in the Oval Office on Monday, Trump adopted some of Moscow’s talking points, questioning whether a ceasefire was “necessary” if a broader peace deal could be achieved.

But international law experts and analysts say that any deal that would force Ukraine to give up its land to stop the killing of its people by Russia would be completely illegal under the UN Charter, a key international agreement which most countries signed up to after the horrors of the Second World War.

While often thought of as essentially the same thing, there is a big difference between a peace deal and a ceasefire in the eyes of international law.

During a ceasefire, warring parties agree to stop fighting with each side keeping hold of the territory under its military control. So what that also (means) is that any treaty that you procure by use of force is effectively illegal and is inherently void,” said Jeremy Pizzi, an international lawyer and a legal adviser of Global Rights Compliance, a human rights foundation.

Little detail has been shared about the kind of peace deal Putin discussed with Trump last week, but it is clear that the Russian leader has not abandoned some of his maximalist demands, including that Ukraine give up the entire eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, known as the Donbas, and is banned from joining NATO in the future.

This would make the deal doubly illegal under international law: illegal because of the way it would be reached – by force – and illegal because of its content.

But even if he wanted to – which he does not – Zelensky cannot agree to give up territory.

Under the Ukrainian constitution, any change to the country’s borders must be approved by a referendum – a rule that is in place partly because of Russia’s tendency to install puppet governments in foreign countries.

And, crucially, even if Kyiv were to recognize that the reality on the ground gives Russia the de-facto control of some of its land, it would certainly not agree to make this a permanent recognition. That has not stopped some [European leaders](https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-ukraine-zelensky-russia-putin-08-18-25)
 from pushing for a temporary truce first, even though the US president has seemingly decided one is not necessary.

It’s not that [Kyiv](https://www.cnn.com/world/europe/ukraine)
 and its allies don’t want peace. But the understanding is that the pause is temporary – usually to provide a window to negotiate, deliver humanitarian help or evacuate civilians.

Kyiv and its European allies suggested that a ceasefire might be a precursor for a meeting between Zelensky and Putin, followed by a trilateral meeting between Trump, Zelensky, and Putin.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who attended the summit on Monday, said that he “can’t imagine that the next meeting will take place without a ceasefire.”

A ceasefire can be short – like the 1914 Christmas Truce that lasted a few days – or it could stretch to decades. The prohibition of using armed force to conquer territory is absolute under international law,” Pizzi said.

No ‘sensible reason to trust Russia’
------------------------------------

There are also practical and strategic reasons why Ukraine cannot agree to Moscow’s demands.

The Russian military currently controls almost all of Luhansk and more than 70% of Donetsk, which means that Putin is asking Kyiv to give up even more than it has lost so far.

But the parts of the Donbas region that are still under Kyiv’s control include infrastructure that is crucial for Ukraine’s defense. If they were to be taken by Russia, the road to the western parts of the country would be wide open.

There is also little incentive for Kyiv to trust Moscow, Pizzi said.

“Russia has engaged in armed attacks against Ukraine for over 10 years now, consistently, repeatedly during that time. Russia has feigned negotiations, feigned good faith, while continuing to use violence and keeping up the same illegal maximalist goals in the background and Ukrainian authorities are painfully aware of this,” he said.

“There is no logical, sensible reason to trust Russia in the absence of a precursor, a good faith decision or engagement that they make on their part to hold off from killing more Ukrainians,” he added.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that peace negotiations between Ukraine and Russia were ongoing in 2025. The Guardian reported on August 21, 2025, that Trump was stepping back from negotiations, and CNN discussed the difference between a ceasefire and a peace deal on August 19, 2025.

However, the evidence does not explicitly state that a peace deal was reached in early 2025. While there were discussions and negotiations, the articles suggest that a deal was not yet finalized, as Trump was involved in negotiations in August 2025.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence. More information is needed to confirm whether a peace deal was reached in early 2025.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Guardian published an article on August 21, 2025, stating that Donald Trump is taking a step back from negotiations to end the war in Ukraine, mentioning a meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy on August 18, 2025, at the White House (<image:4898>) ([https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/21/trump-ukraine-russia-peace-talks](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/21/trump-ukraine-russia-peace-talks)). Wikipedia discusses peace negotiations in the Russian invasion of Ukraine, mentioning a timeline of the war, including events up to December 2024 and a timeline for 2025, and a meeting between Trump, Macron, and Zelenskyy in December 2024 ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_negotiations_in_the_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_negotiations_in_the_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine)).

CNN published an article on August 19, 2025, discussing the difference between a ceasefire and a peace deal in the context of the war between Ukraine and Russia (<image:0>, <image:1>, <image:2>, <image:3>, <image:4>) ([https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/19/europe/ukraine-ceasefire-peace-deal-difference-analysis-latam-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/19/europe/ukraine-ceasefire-peace-deal-difference-analysis-latam-intl)). The article mentions that Donald Trump is pushing for a peace deal, while Ukraine wants a ceasefire.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that peace negotiations between Ukraine and Russia were ongoing in 2025. The Guardian reported on August 21, 2025, that Trump was stepping back from negotiations, and CNN discussed the difference between a ceasefire and a peace deal on August 19, 2025.

However, the evidence does not explicitly state that a peace deal was reached in early 2025. While there were discussions and negotiations, the articles suggest that a deal was not yet finalized, as Trump was involved in negotiations in August 2025.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence. More information is needed to confirm whether a peace deal was reached in early 2025.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "In early 2025, Ukraine and Russia had reached a peace deal in their years-long war."

## Actions
```
web_search("Ukraine Russia peace deal 2025")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Guardian published an article on August 21, 2025, stating that Donald Trump is taking a step back from negotiations to end the war in Ukraine, mentioning a meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy on August 18, 2025, at the White House (<image:4898>) ([https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/21/trump-ukraine-russia-peace-talks](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/21/trump-ukraine-russia-peace-talks)). Wikipedia discusses peace negotiations in the Russian invasion of Ukraine, mentioning a timeline of the war, including events up to December 2024 and a timeline for 2025, and a meeting between Trump, Macron, and Zelenskyy in December 2024 ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_negotiations_in_the_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_negotiations_in_the_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine)).

CNN published an article on August 19, 2025, discussing the difference between a ceasefire and a peace deal in the context of the war between Ukraine and Russia (<image:0>, <image:1>, <image:2>, <image:3>, <image:4>) ([https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/19/europe/ukraine-ceasefire-peace-deal-difference-analysis-latam-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/19/europe/ukraine-ceasefire-peace-deal-difference-analysis-latam-intl)). The article mentions that Donald Trump is pushing for a peace deal, while Ukraine wants a ceasefire.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that peace negotiations between Ukraine and Russia were ongoing in 2025. The Guardian reported on August 21, 2025, that Trump was stepping back from negotiations, and CNN discussed the difference between a ceasefire and a peace deal on August 19, 2025.

However, the evidence does not explicitly state that a peace deal was reached in early 2025. While there were discussions and negotiations, the articles suggest that a deal was not yet finalized, as Trump was involved in negotiations in August 2025.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence. More information is needed to confirm whether a peace deal was reached in early 2025.

*   Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko told the UNSC that “Russia continues to choose killing over ending the war” with its continued attacks.
*   Russia’s deputy UN ambassador, Dmitry Polyanskiy, said Moscow was prepared to consider a summit with Ukraine “provided that there is thorough prior preparation for such a meeting and the substantive content of it; otherwise, it would simply not have any meaning”.

*   European defence ministers meeting in Copenhagen expressed “broad support” for expanding the bloc’s military training mission to operate inside Ukraine, the EU’s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, said.
*   President Zelenskyy said he expected to continue talks with European leaders next week on “NATO-like” commitments to protect Ukraine, adding that US President Donald Trump should also be involved in the discussions.
*   The Ukrainian leader also said he wanted Ukraine’s allies to ratify any security guarantees through their parliaments, invoking a 1994 deal in which Kyiv agreed to give up its nuclear arsenal in exchange for security assurances that proved insufficient to deter Russia’s invasion.
*   Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said proposals on security guarantees for Ukraine would increase the risk of conflict between Moscow and the West by turning Kyiv into a “strategic provocateur” on Russia’s borders.
*   Estonia’s Defence Minister Hanno Pevkur said the best security guarantee for Ukraine would be membership in NATO.

Here is how things stand on Saturday, August 30:

Fighting
--------

*   The Ukrainian military said it had carried out an overnight strike on a facility in Russia’s Bryansk region that was responsible for the flow of diesel fuelling Moscow’s war effort in Ukraine.
    
*   Kyiv’s General Staff said the fuel pumping station in the village of Naitopovichi had a capacity of approximately 10.5 million tonnes per year, and that the strike had caused a fire.
    
*   Russian Defence Minister Andrei Belousov said the Russian army had sped up its rate of advance in Ukraine and was taking control of some 600 to 700 square kilometres (231- 270sq miles) each month compared to 300-400 square kilometres (115-154sq miles) at the start of this year.
    
*   Belousov also said that Russia had inflicted significant damage on Ukraine’s military and industrial infrastructure, carrying out 35 strikes this year on what he called 146 critically important targets. At least 23 people were killed, including four children, and 50 were injured in Kyiv when Russia launched an overnight attack over Ukraine, according to the State Emergency Service. “It’s a foreign influence operation meant to hurt the administration and one of our most effective members,” Vance wrote on X.
*   Russia and China jointly oppose “discriminatory” sanctions in global trade that hinder the world’s socioeconomic development, President Putin said in a written interview with China’s official Xinhua news agency."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Guardian published an article on August 21, 2025, stating that Donald Trump is taking a step back from negotiations to end the war in Ukraine, mentioning a meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy on August 18, 2025, at the White House (<image:4898>) ([https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/21/trump-ukraine-russia-peace-talks](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/21/trump-ukraine-russia-peace-talks)). Wikipedia discusses peace negotiations in the Russian invasion of Ukraine, mentioning a timeline of the war, including events up to December 2024 and a timeline for 2025, and a meeting between Trump, Macron, and Zelenskyy in December 2024 ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_negotiations_in_the_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_negotiations_in_the_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine)).

CNN published an article on August 19, 2025, discussing the difference between a ceasefire and a peace deal in the context of the war between Ukraine and Russia (<image:0>, <image:1>, <image:2>, <image:3>, <image:4>) ([https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/19/europe/ukraine-ceasefire-peace-deal-difference-analysis-latam-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/19/europe/ukraine-ceasefire-peace-deal-difference-analysis-latam-intl)). The article mentions that Donald Trump is pushing for a peace deal, while Ukraine wants a ceasefire.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that peace negotiations between Ukraine and Russia were ongoing in 2025. The Guardian reported on August 21, 2025, that Trump was stepping back from negotiations, and CNN discussed the difference between a ceasefire and a peace deal on August 19, 2025.

However, the evidence does not explicitly state that a peace deal was reached in early 2025. While there were discussions and negotiations, the articles suggest that a deal was not yet finalized, as Trump was involved in negotiations in August 2025.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence. More information is needed to confirm whether a peace deal was reached in early 2025.

The evidence indicates that peace negotiations were ongoing in early 2025, but it does not confirm that a peace deal was reached. The Independent mentions a meeting between Zelenskyy and Trump on February 28, 2025, and an agreement on February 18, 2025, but also reports violations. Furthermore, the timeline includes a 30-hour ceasefire in April and proposals for further talks in May and June, suggesting that a final deal was not yet in place.

The Guardian published an article on August 21, 2025, stating that Donald Trump is taking a step back from negotiations to end the war in Ukraine, mentioning a meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy on August 18, 2025, at the White House (<image:4898>) ([https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/21/trump-ukraine-russia-peace-talks](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/21/trump-ukraine-russia-peace-talks)). Wikipedia discusses peace negotiations in the Russian invasion of Ukraine, mentioning a timeline of the war, including events up to December 2024 and a timeline for 2025, and a meeting between Trump, Macron, and Zelenskyy in December 2024 ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_negotiations_in_the_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_negotiations_in_the_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine)).

CNN published an article on August 19, 2025, discussing the difference between a ceasefire and a peace deal in the context of the war between Ukraine and Russia (<image:0>, <image:1>, <image:2>, <image:3>, <image:4>) ([https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/19/europe/ukraine-ceasefire-peace-deal-difference-analysis-latam-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/19/europe/ukraine-ceasefire-peace-deal-difference-analysis-latam-intl)). The article mentions that Donald Trump is pushing for a peace deal, while Ukraine wants a ceasefire.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that peace negotiations between Ukraine and Russia were ongoing in 2025. The Guardian reported on August 21, 2025, that Trump was stepping back from negotiations, and CNN discussed the difference between a ceasefire and a peace deal on August 19, 2025.

However, the evidence does not explicitly state that a peace deal was reached in early 2025. While there were discussions and negotiations, the articles suggest that a deal was not yet finalized, as Trump was involved in negotiations in August 2025.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence. More information is needed to confirm whether a peace deal was reached in early 2025.

Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/30/russia-ukraine-war-list-of-key-events-day-1283](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/30/russia-ukraine-war-list-of-key-events-day-1283)) reported on August 30, 2025, that peace talks were ongoing. The Independent ([https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/turkey-peace-talks-russia-ukraine-invasion-timeline-b2750560.html](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/turkey-peace-talks-russia-ukraine-invasion-timeline-b2750560.html)) mentions a meeting between Zelenskyy and Trump on February 28, 2025, and that both sides agreed to a plan on February 18, 2025, but soon accused each other of violations. It also mentions Putin announcing a 30-hour ceasefire on April 19, 2025, and a proposal to restart talks in Istanbul on May 15, 2025 (<image:8199>).


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that peace negotiations were ongoing in early 2025, but it does not confirm that a peace deal was reached. The Independent mentions a meeting between Zelenskyy and Trump on February 28, 2025, and an agreement on February 18, 2025, but also reports violations. Furthermore, the timeline includes a 30-hour ceasefire in April and proposals for further talks in May and June, suggesting that a final deal was not yet in place.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.

 He said: "The reality is that the President of the United States, whoever he is, has every right to tell the president of another country you better straighten out the corruption in your country if you want me to give you a lot of money.

As the second week of the Trump impeachment trial was set to begin in January 2020, _The New York Times_ reported that Bolton wrote in his forthcoming book that the president had told him in August 2019 that he wanted to continue freezing the Ukraine aid until officials there pursued investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens.[\[249\]](#cite_note-Schmidt-251)

### Withholding of White House visit

In a May 2019 letter congratulating Zelenskyy on his election, Trump raised the possibility of a White House visit. Pillsbury later told _The Washington Post_, "most everything I learned was already public or well-known" and that the Chinese "really, really didn't want to talk about it".[\[334\]](#cite_note-337)

### Release of John Bolton's manuscript

On January 26, _The New York Times_ reported that former national security advisor John Bolton had written in a draft of his forthcoming book, _[The Room Where It Happened](/wiki/The_Room_Where_It_Happened "The Room Where It Happened")
_, that the president told him in August 2019 that he wanted to continue freezing $391 million in aid to Ukraine until officials there pursued investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens.[\[249\]](#cite_note-Schmidt-251)
 Trump denied Bolton's claim.[\[335\]](#cite_note-Re-338)
 The manuscript was released after the first week of the impeachment trial, prompting House impeachment managers to call for the Senate to call Bolton as a witness.[\[336\]](#cite_note-339)
 Bolton also claimed to have discussed the suspension of aid with Attorney General William Barr, and that the two had shared concerns over Trump offering personal favours to the leaders of autocratic regimes around the world, including [Recep Tayyip Erdoğan](/wiki/Recep_Tayyip_Erdo%C4%9Fan "Recep Tayyip Erdoğan")

 described it as unprecedented for an incumbent president to "personally apply pressure to foreign powers to damage political opponents".[\[403\]](#cite_note-AbsolutelyCouldNot-407)
 When the ten were interviewed, "none recalled any circumstance under which the White House had solicited or accepted political help from other countries, and all said they would have considered the very idea out of bounds."[\[403\]](#cite_note-AbsolutelyCouldNot-407)

In an op-ed in _The Washington Post_, 17 former members of the [Watergate scandal](/wiki/Watergate_scandal "Watergate scandal")
 special prosecutor force[\[f\]](#cite_note-410)
 wrote that "there exists compelling _prima facie_ evidence that President Trump has committed impeachable offenses," specifically serious and persistent [abuses of power](/wiki/Abuses_of_power "Abuses of power")
, and the Congress "should not allow any refusal by the president to cooperate in its process to frustrate the performance of its constitutional duties."[\[404\]](#cite_note-FmrWatergate-409)

### American editorials and commentary

_The Washington Post_ and _The New York Times_ editorial boards supported the impeachment inquiry against Trump arising from the scandal.[\[405\]](#cite_note-Stonewall-411)
[\[406\]](#cite_note-412)
 The _Post_ editorial board criticized the administration and its allies for defying congressional subpoenas and stonewalling the investigation,[\[405\]](#cite_note-Stonewall-411)
[\[407\]](#cite_note-413)
 and called upon congressional Republicans to "have the moral courage" to recognize the Trump administration's Ukraine pressure campaign as corrupt and a _quid pro quo_.[\[408\]](#cite_note-414)
 Another _The Washington Post_ editorial criticized the Trump administration for attacking [William B. I think it's important for the American people to be thoughtful consumers of information and to think about the sources of it and to think about the support and predication for what they hear."[\[461\]](#cite_note-468)

Multiple tweets, posted between November 12-15, 2022, claim that Ukraine sent billions of dollars sourced from foreign aid to FTX, which was then sent back to the Democratic party.

The claim has been spread by a number of prominent right-leaning commentators and politicians, including [Madison Cawthorn](https://twitter.com/CawthornforNC)
, [James Woods](https://twitter.com/RealJamesWoods/status/1592041414829166592)
, [Calvin Robinson](https://twitter.com/calvinrobinson/status/1592031504875544577)

 and [Jack Posobiec](https://twitter.com/JackPosobiec/status/1591855516053303298)
, among others.

Various iterations of the narrative took root on conspiracy theory subreddits, 4Chan, and other fringe online spaces.

The collapse of FTX has had a staggering impact on the world of cryptocurrencies, resulting in a dominoes-like collapse of popular cryptos, such as [Bitcoin](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/bitcoin)
, the value of [which fell to a two-year-low](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/09/bitcoin-falls-below-17k-amid-latest-ftx-meltdown/)
, and shaking the industry as a whole.

To understand if and how its demise is connected to U.S. dollar, though that may be no longer [tenable](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/10/tethers-usdt-stablecoin-slips-from-1-peg/)
).

Everstake, a crypto firm involved in setting up the donations, [has responded on Twitter](https://twitter.com/everstake_pool/status/1592621937054085120)
 to claims that these funds were illegally transferred to the Democrats, stating Aid for Ukraine had used FTX "only a few times in March 2022 exclusively to convert crypto donations into fiat" which it said The National Bank of Ukraine [had confirmed receipt of.](https://twitter.com/NBUkraine/status/1502207218514604034)

It added that of the $60 million received through Aid For Ukraine, $54 million had been spent on "Ukraine's humanitarian and military needs." Ukraine's Vice Prime Minister Fedorov Mykhailo made the same claim on Twitter, and included what he said was a [breakdown of this spending.](https://twitter.com/FedorovMykhailo/status/1559923193581899777)

Everstake added that the funds received were not stored on FTX and could be "converted into fiat elsewhere if necessary."

Its CEO Sergey Vasylchuk [took to Twitter](https://twitter.com/everstake_pool/status/1592622417226366977)
 as well, alleging that the claim was part of a Russian disinformation effort.

"Every time Russia is defeated on the battlefield, it starts looking for another way to cover up its military failures in the media by spreading fake news based on made-up assumptions," Vasylchuk said.

"This time, they decided to use the FTX collapse to spin yet another tale about money laundering. aid misappropriated?
-----------------------------

The claim that funds were effectively "laundered" from Ukraine via FTX back into the U.S., less so to the Democratic party coffers or Biden himself, is unevidenced.

_Newsweek_ has investigated the coverage of this claim across social media and larger media outlets and could find no transaction ID, statements, or any other tangible evidence to support the idea that U.S. government funding—under the nose of a multi-million dollar oversight process coordinated between the Office of Inspector General, the DOD and USAID—it would require a major lapse in oversight from those auditing Ukraine and a breakdown of protections in place to ensure funds could not be re-appropriated.

Furthermore, funding for Ukraine [received bipartisan support](https://www.newsweek.com/these-69-house-reps-voted-against-providing-ukraine-aid-1686658)
, meaning that both Democrats and Republicans signed off on the terms of the funding and how it would be managed.

In response to these claims Alex Bornyakov, Deputy Minister of Digital Transformation of Ukraine on IT industry development [tweeted:](https://twitter.com/abornyakov/status/1592241279051743233)
 "A fundraising crypto foundation [@\_AidForUkraine](https://twitter.com/_AidForUkraine)

Did FTX send Ukrainian crypto donations to the U.S.?
----------------------------------------------------

FTX has also played a role in providing Ukraine with the capability to receive cryptocurrency donations since Russia's invasion.

In [March 2022](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/03/14/ukraine-partners-with-ftx-everstake-to-launch-new-crypto-donation-website/)
, the Ukrainian government launched a crypto donations website, Aid for Ukraine, with the backing of FTX, to route donated crypto to the National Bank of Ukraine. According [to its website](https://aid-for-ukraine.io/)
, Aid for Ukraine has received more than $60 million in donations including [611 Bitcoin](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/357a3So9CbsNfBBgFYACGvxxS6tMaDoa1P)
, [10,723 Ethereum](https://www.blockchain.com/eth/address/0x165CD37b4C644C2921454429E7F9358d18A45e14)
, and 15,048,821 USDT (which is at least on paper supposed to be pegged to the U.S. foreign aid receives to ensure that it is spent appropriately on measures relating to Ukrainian assistance.

For example, under the Additional Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Act 2022, the bill behind the $40 billion in emergency funding to Ukraine, $5 million was spent on oversight of the funds alone, including by the Department of State Inspector General and the USAID Inspector General.

The Office of Inspector General Oversight in the Department of Defence (DOD OIG) and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID OIG) both provide audits of the use of funding in Ukraine and investigate complaints and allegations of misuse or attempted misuse of [USAID funding](https://oig.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/2022-11/Office%20of%20Investigations%20Ukraine%20Briefing%20Sheet%20-%20Oct%2022.pdf)

CLAIM: U.S. The company filed for bankruptcy protection amid news it was short billions of dollars and may have been hacked.

The move has fueled baseless conspiracy theories on social media around the embattled former CEO’s donations, FTX, and Democrats who ran in this year’s midterm elections.

“So Biden gave loads of money to Ukraine, who gave loads of money to FTX, who gave loads of money to Democrats,” reads one tweet with over 100,000 likes.

“For an entire year Democrat law makers have stood on the House floor and demanded taxpayer $$ for Ukraine. The ministry said it “provided informational support” to the foundation, which was run by the cryptocurrency exchange Kuna and the blockchain company Everstake.

In early March, Aid For Ukraine began working with FTX to convert cryptocurrency donations into Ukraine’s government-issued currency, a partnership that ended in April 2022, according to the ministry.

Sergey Vasylchuk, the CEO of Everstake, told the AP that cryptocurrencies were an efficient way to raise funds for Ukraine to defend itself amid Russia’s invasion. The donations would then get sent to the [National Bank of Ukraine](https://twitter.com/NBUkraine/status/1502207218514604034)
 and no crypto was stored on FTX.

“It was eight months ago and the goal was that Aid for Ukraine was to supply the needs as soon as possible,” Vasylchuk said when asked about the relationship between Aid for Ukraine and FTX. FTX’s co-CEO [Ryan Salame](https://www.fec.gov/data/receipts/individual-contributions/?contributor_name=Ryan+Salame&two_year_transaction_period=2022&min_date=01%2F01%2F2021&max_date=12%2F31%2F2022)
 also donated to groups that supported Republican candidates in 2022, including the Senate Leadership Fund, the Congressional Leadership Fund and American Dream Federal Action, which he [founded](https://americandreamaction.com/adfa-founder-pandemic-prevention-one-of-best-things-we-can-do-for-future-generations/)
.

White House spokesperson Robyn Patterson said any claim that U.S. officials [announced](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-europe-congress-government-and-politics-f72e45a5229fa311819b83dcbb2e5216)
 earlier this month the country will send $400 million more in military aid to Ukraine, including funding for ammunition and air defense systems."

From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Trump%E2%80%93Ukraine_scandal): 
Content: The search result from Wikipedia discusses the 2019 Trump–Ukraine scandal, including allegations that Trump requested investigations into Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden.

From [Source](https://www.newsweek.com/what-behind-claim-joe-biden-laundered-billions-ukraine-aid-via-ftx-1759774): 
Content: Newsweek published an article discussing the claim that US aid to Ukraine was laundered and sent to Democrat candidates. The article mentions that the claim originated from social media posts and was spread by right-leaning commentators. It also mentions that the Ukrainian government launched a crypto donations website, Aid for Ukraine, with the backing of FTX, to route donated crypto to the National Bank of Ukraine in March 2022. The article states that there is no evidence to support the claim that funds were laundered from Ukraine via FTX back into the U.S. <image:2147>.

President Joe Biden has said the "irresponsible and relentless promotion of disinformation and outright lies" about the government's hurricane response is "undermining confidence" in rescue and recovery efforts, even as Hurricane Milton heads towards Florida.

Since Hurricane Helene caused widespread damage in several states, misleading and false claims have been spreading and have intensified as Florida prepares for a new hurricane.

Against the backdrop of the election campaign, Donald Trump has been highly critical of the Biden-Harris administration's response.

Biden has responded by condemning a number of claims by Trump and other Republicans - BBC Verify has been examining them.

Has government money for hurricane victims been spent on migrants?
------------------------------------------------------------------

At multiple campaign events since the hurricane struck, Trump and his allies have claimed that government money earmarked for disaster victims has been spent on migrants who crossed illegally into the US.

“Kamala spent all her Fema money - billions of dollars - on housing for illegal migrants," Trump said in Michigan last week.

This claim is false.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), a government agency, has a Disaster Relief Fund - worth more than $20bn (£15bn) for the last financial year - which is ring-fenced to spend on responding to hurricanes and other natural disasters.

Fema also has a dedicated budget from Congress to be spent on food, shelter, transportation, and other support services for immigrants released from Department of Homeland Security (DHS) custody.

This budget amounts to around $1bn over the last two financial years - not the “billions” Trump claims.

So, these are two separate pots of money - administered by the agency - which Trump appears to be conflating.

Fema, which has now set up a [fact-checking page](https://www.fema.gov/disaster/current/hurricane-helene/rumor-response)
 on its website, called Trump's claim "false" saying, "no money is being diverted from disaster response needs".

In 2019, while Trump was president, money was diverted [from Fema's Disaster Relief Fund](https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/fema_-_disaster_relief_fund_-_september_2019.pdf)
 - around $38m - to give to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

The focus on Fema's current funding comes after the Secretary of Homeland Security, Alejandro Mayorkas - who oversees the agency - warned that it was running low on funds for the rest of the hurricane season.

But Fema says it has “enough money right now for immediate response and recovery needs”.

[Political row erupts over Hurricane Helene disaster relief\
----------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y3qgqxpwno)

Are hurricane victims only getting $750?
----------------------------------------

Donald Trump and his running mate JD Vance have repeatedly highlighted a $750 payment from Fema to hurricane victims, often contrasting it with the money the US government spends on Ukraine or on illegal migrants.

“They promised $750 to American citizens who have lost everything,” Vance said at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania on Saturday.

It is true that the victims are getting $750 but some context is needed.

This is just one type of assistance provided by Fema.

The $750 is what people can get as an [upfront payment](https://www.fema.gov/node/fema-will-only-provide-750-disaster-survivors-support-their-recovery)
 to help cover the costs of food, water, medication, and other emergency supplies.

Following this initial payment, disaster victims may receive additional funds following a Fema assessment.

This can go towards repairing damage to homes and personal property, and to help find a temporary place to stay.

So far, [Fema has said that more than $210m](https://www.fema.gov/press-release/20241007/federal-assistance-hurricane-helene-exceeds-210-million-fema-prepares-dual)
 has been given to communities affected by Hurricane Helene - this includes upfront payments and money to support housing needs.

! By the time Trump made this remark on 5 October, the North Carolina National Guard, which is under the dual command of federal and state governments, had already [posted on X](https://x.com/ncnationalguard/status/1841976269941952920?s=46)
 that its “air assets have completed 146 flight missions, resulting in the rescue of 538 people and 150 pets”.

The post, published on 3 October, featured a video of a National Guard helicopter.

The [North Carolina Department of Public Safety's website](https://www.ncdps.gov/news/press-releases/2024/10/05/hurricane-helene-recovery-progresses-western-north-carolina)
 says that President Biden approved the state governor’s request for military personnel and equipment to support rescue operations in North Carolina.

The National Guard and military personnel “are operating 50 helicopters” as part of search and rescue missions, and are also helping to deliver critical supplies in the state, the department said.

JD Vance criticised Fema's response to the hurricane at a rally in Butler on Saturday

Did Biden call the Governor of Georgia?
---------------------------------------

When the hurricane first hit, Trump claimed that the governor of Georgia hadn’t spoken to President Biden following the state being badly affected.

“He has been calling the president, hasn't been able to get him,” Trump said at a news conference in Georgia on the afternoon of 30 September.

But earlier that day, Georgia’s Governor Brian Kemp - a Republican - said in an interview: “The president just called me yesterday afternoon, I missed him and called him right back, and he just said ‘hey what do you need?’ and I told him we’ve got what we need, we’re working through the federal process.”

“He offered if there’s other things we need to call him directly, which I appreciate,” he added.

The death toll from a devastating storm that battered the southeastern United States climbed to at least 130 on Monday, September 30, as the disaster became a hot topic in an already bitter election campaign, with the White House angrily refuting claims it had been slow to respond.

With hundreds still missing across several southeastern US states and the death toll climbing, President Joe Biden announced he would travel to storm-ravaged North Carolina Wednesday to monitor rescue efforts.

Biden also accused former president Donald Trump of spreading lies, after the Republican presidential candidate charged, without evidence, that the federal government was ignoring the disaster brought on by Hurricane Helene and denying help to his supporters. that's simply not true, and it's irresponsible."

At least 130 people were killed by the storm and associated flooding: 57 in North Carolina, 29 in South Carolina, 25 in Georgia, 14 in Florida, four in Tennessee and one in Virginia, according to tallies from local authorities and media reports compiled by Agence France-Presse (AFP).

Widespread havoc
----------------

Emergency workers continued a grim search for hundreds of people still unaccounted for across the affected states, where torrential rains brought widespread havoc. A president's role is usually to oversee and coordinate aid, including funding.

Scientists say climate change likely plays a role in the rapid intensification of hurricanes, because there is more energy in warmer oceans for them to feed on, and Biden stressed as much Monday. "And we have responded with our best, with the best folks who are on the ground and here doing the kind of work that is about rising to a moment of crisis."

Responding to Trump's criticism that he was "sleeping" instead of dealing with the storm damage, Biden defended his decision to spend the weekend at his home in Delaware, saying he was working "the whole time."

In Georgia, residents faced power cuts, supply shortages, blocked roads and broken communication lines in often mountainous terrain, with Governor Brian Kemp describing the storm as a "250-mile wide tornado."

Close to two million households and businesses remained without power on Monday, according to tracker poweroutage.us. "He's lying," Biden told reporters in the Oval Office, adding that he had spoken to North Carolina governor Ray Cooper "and he told him he's lying. The death toll was expected to rise, authorities warned, with cell phone service knocked out across much of the region and up to 600 people still missing.

With Biden preparing to head to North Carolina, Trump on Monday arrived in Georgia, another epicenter of the destruction – and both are among the key swing states where the US election will be decided in just five weeks. "The vice president, she's out someplace, campaigning, looking for money," he said, referring to his election rival, Vice President Kamala Harris."

[Back-to-back hurricanes](/tag/hurricanes/)
 that brought death and devastation to parts of the South were made worse by a wide range of false and misleading information, some of which still circulates even though they have been conclusively proven false.

Coming in the closing weeks of a [hard-fought presidential election](/tag/decision-2024/)
, the false information became political fodder, particularly in swing states hit hard by Hurricane Helene and then Hurricane Milton. military in which dry ice was dropped by Air Force planes into the path of a hurricane in an attempt to weaken it also didn’t work.

The Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office in Florida shared an aerial video showing agents rescuing citizens trapped in their homes in floodwaters.

The federal government was falsely accused of a lack of response following Helene
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CLAIM: The federal government did not respond to Hurricane Helene and intentionally withheld aid to victims in Republican areas.

THE FACTS: Both President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, have actively supported recovery efforts.

Biden approved major disaster declarations for Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee and Virginia, allowing survivors to access funds and resources to jumpstart their recovery immediately. FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell said Wednesday on MSNBC, “There is the money in my budget — the Disaster Relief Fund — to continue the response efforts for Hurricane Helene and Milton.” She added that the agency will need to assess how much money will be left to continue recovery projects and respond to future storms this season.

FEMA’s disaster relief fund gets replenished every year by Congress and is used to pay for recovery from hurricanes, floods, earthquakes and other disasters. It funds foreign military aid separately.

No money from FEMA’s fund has been diverted to support border issues or international concerns and is only being used for disaster-related efforts, according to the agency.

The helicopter that blew supplies around a North Carolina distribution center was attempting to make a delivery
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CLAIM: The federal government is flying unmarked helicopters into Hurricane Helene staging zones and purposely destroying aid meant for victims in western North Carolina.

THE FACTS: These claims are based on a video that showed a helicopter flying above a parking lot where hurricane aid was being collected. Former President Donald Trump has pushed a litany of false claims at campaign events and on social media with his supporters helping give voice to the information.

Federal, state and local officials, including several Republicans, have condemned the false information, noting that it has made it more difficult to address the needs of those hurt by the hurricanes.

At least 16 people are dead and more than 2 million people are without power after Hurricane Milton impacted central Florida.

Here's a look at the facts around some of the most pervasive misinformation.

The government cannot create or manage hurricanes
-------------------------------------------------

CLAIM: The government used weather technology to create Hurricanes Helene and Milton, deliberately targeting Republican voters.

### U.S. Hurricanes are hitting many of the same areas they have for centuries.

Fully developed hurricanes release massive amounts of heat energy — the equivalent of a 10-megaton nuclear bomb every 20 minutes, according to National Hurricane Center tropical analysis chief Chris Landsea.

“If meteorologists could stop hurricanes, we would stop hurricanes,” said Kristen Corbosiero, a professor of atmospheric and environmental sciences at the University at Albany. She called Helene’s devastation “heartbreaking” and vowed that she and Biden would make sure the impacted communities “get what they need to recover.”

The president and vice president have both been to areas impacted by Helene.

Federal officials do not have plans to seize some hard-hit communities
----------------------------------------------------------------------

CLAIM: The federal government plans to seize and bulldoze some especially hard-hit communities like Chimney Rock, North Carolina, and prevent residents from rebuilding on their own property.

THE FACTS: That's not true, according to local officials. It does not have to be repaid
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CLAIM: Hurricane survivors will only get a $750 loan from FEMA, which will seize their land if they don’t pay it back.

THE FACTS: That’s not true. Keith Turi, acting director of FEMA’s Office of Response and Recovery, said that this figure refers to help the agency can give someone in an affected area for immediate needs, like clothing or food.

FEMA wrote on its “Hurricane Rumor Response” page that such payments are called Serious Needs Assistances and can be used while the agency assesses an applicant’s eligibility for additional funds.

The maximum amount for initial Serious Needs Assistance was raised to $770 on Oct. For example, if a survivor receives duplicate benefits from insurance or another source.

FEMA is not short of hurricane assistance because it went to other causes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

CLAIM: FEMA doesn’t have enough money for hurricane victims because it is being used to help immigrants in the country illegally or going to foreign funding for Israel and Ukraine.

THE FACTS: That's incorrect."

Content: NBC Washington published an article on October 11, 2024, updated on October 15, 2024, discussing false information surrounding Hurricanes Helene and Milton. The article states that both President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris supported recovery efforts. It also mentions that FEMA's disaster relief fund is used for recovery from hurricanes and other disasters and that it funds foreign military aid separately. The article debunks claims that the federal government did not respond to Hurricane Helene and intentionally withheld aid, and that FEMA doesn’t have enough money for hurricane victims because it is being used to help immigrants or going to foreign funding for Israel and Ukraine. <image:8233>, <image:8234>

The rapid developments have worried Europe that Putin and Trump appear to be negotiating the future of the continent’s security over the heads of the Europeans themselves.

“If Europe is responsible for Ukraine’s security and could even provide troops \[under a ceasefire agreement\], then we should have a seat at the table and be consulted with the Americans,” said one European official. Our priority right now is to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position.”

Trump’s announcement followed a prisoner swap involving [Marc Fogel,](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/11/russia-us-prisoner-trump-marc-fogel)
 a US teacher who was arrested in Moscow on drug charges, and Alexander Vinnik, who was arrested in 2017 in Greece on cryptocurrency fraud charges and then extradited to the US.

The deal was arranged by Steve Witkoff, Trump’s envoy to the Middle East, one of the president’s closest allies on the team that will lead negotiations with the Russians.

The US negotiating team would include the secretary of state, Marco Rubio; the director of the CIA, John Ratcliffe; the national security adviser, Michael Waltz; and Witkoff.

Notable for his absence from the negotiating team was Gen Keith Kellogg, whom Trump had earlier named his special envoy to Ukraine and Russia and who was in the process of meeting with European leaders to discuss the upcoming negotiations.

Yet few were convinced he spoke directly for Trump, and he offered few concrete details beyond his “deep faith” that Trump was the best person to negotiate the deal, one official said.

Trump says he has spoken to Putin and agreed to negotiate Ukraine ceasefire
===========================================================================

US secretary of defence Pete Hegseth says Ukraine would have to cede territory, alarming Kyiv and European allies

[Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump)
 has said that he and [Vladimir Putin](https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin)
 have agreed to begin negotiations to broker a ceasefire in Ukraine, later adding that it was unlikely Kyiv would win back all its territory or join Nato if a deal is to be reached.

Trump said that he was “OK” with [Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine)
 not having Nato membership and that it was “unlikely” that Ukraine would take much land back in the negotiations.

Russia “took a lot of land, and they fought for that land and they lost a lot of soldiers”, he told reporters later in the Oval Office.

Trump said he was not closely concerned with which territories were handed over.

“I’m just here to try and get peace,” he said. We agreed to work together, very closely, including visiting each other’s Nations.”

The Kremlin confirmed the call and the mutual invitations for the leaders to visit each other’s countries in what would be the first visits by an American president to Russia since 2009 and the first by Putin to the US since 2015.

In its readout, the Kremlin also maintained a maximalist position, with Putin saying he “mentioned the need to eliminate the root causes of the conflict and agreed with Trump that a long-term settlement could be achieved through peaceful negotiations”.

Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy – at least in public – offered support for the talks on Wednesday, saying he and Trump had held a “meaningful” conversation by phone. As President Trump said, let’s get it done.”

Trump told reporters that the US would seek to “secure” future military aid against Ukrainian rare earth minerals and other natural resources.

Trump said he was not concerned about freezing out Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy of the talks, saying: “I don’t think so as long as he’s there.”

But, he said, “sometime \[Ukraine’s\] going to have to have elections too … His poll numbers aren’t particularly great.”

Trump said Zelenskyy would meet on Friday with the vice-president, JD Vance, and the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, on the sidelines of the Munich security conference.

Earlier on Wednesday, the US negotiating position was outlined in Brussels, where secretary of defence Pete Hegseth delivered public remarks that [Kyiv must acknowledge that it cannot win back all the land occupied by Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/12/us-no-longer-primarily-focused-on-europes-security-says-pete-hegseth)
.

“We must start by recognising that returning to Ukraine’s pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic objective,” Hegseth said, sketching out an initial position for any peace negotiations with Russia.

“Chasing this illusory goal will only prolong the war and cause more suffering,” he added, though this could be interpreted as in effect acknowledging the annexation of Crimea, and large parts of the Donbas, by Russia.

Kyiv would only achieve peace through “robust security guarantees”, but Hegseth ruled out Nato membership for Ukraine. The German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said that Ukraine’s interests must be protected in the upcoming negotiations between Moscow and Washington. “I don’t care so much about anything other than I want to stop having millions of people killed.”

The rapid entry into negotiations with Russia and open demands that Ukraine concede land will have set alarm bells ringing in Kyiv and among its European allies that the Trump administration will offer minimal resistance to Putin’s demands in order to cut a deal as quickly as possible.

In a social media post, Trump said he held a “lengthy and highly productive phone call” with Putin and that they agreed to “have our respective teams start negotiations immediately”.

He said that he and Putin had agreed to visit each other’s countries, later telling reporters that their first meeting would take place in Saudi Arabia.

“As we both agreed, we want to stop the millions of deaths taking place in the War with Russia/Ukraine,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. That includes much of eastern Europe, including Poland and the Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia.

In December, Putin also stated that he would insist on Ukraine adopting a neutral status and implementing some degree of demilitarisation, while also demanding that the west lift its sanctions on Russia.

Kyiv has rejected those demands in the past and the Biden administration had said that it would be up to Ukraine to decide when to hold peace talks.

Earlier this week, [Zelenskyy told the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/11/zelenskyy-europe-cannot-guarantee-ukraines-security-without-america)
 that Europe was not able to offer resilient security guarantees to Kyiv without the involvement of the US. So we must accept this and figure out what we can do.”

Another senior European diplomat called the US position outlined by Hegseth a premature surrender, asking what there would be left to negotiate. The French foreign minister, Jean Noël-Barrot, called for Europe’s direct participation in the talks, saying that there “will be no just and lasting peace in Ukraine without the participation of Europeans”.

A spokesperson for the British foreign office expressed support for Trump’s desire to bring the war to an end, but added: “Russia could do this tomorrow by withdrawing its forces and ending its illegal invasion."

A post [shared on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/urbaniulian/posts/10227566798023994)
 claims Germany threatened to cut ties with the United States.

**Verdict: Misleading**

Baerbock did not threaten to cut relations with the United States.

**Fact Check:**

Social media users are claiming that German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock threatened to cut diplomatic ties with the United States. That is why I will support Ukraine as long as it needs it, because it is our peace.”

Germany has not threatened to cut off relations with the U.S, according to [Misbar](https://www.misbar.com/en/factcheck/2025/02/23/germany-has-not-threatened-cut-ties-us-after-talks-russia)

We are increasing the pressure on the Americans so that they have as much to lose as possible if they no longer stand by the side of the liberal democracies of Europe,” she is quoted as saying.

At the same time, Berbock, in the context of German-American relations, called for waiting for further developments, as "nothing has been decided yet."

"We will increase pressure on the Americans to realize that they have as much as possible to lose if they stop supporting the liberal democracies of Europe," the diplomat stressed.

German Foreign Minister said that decisions on peace can not be made without taking into account the opinion of [Ukraine](https://iz.ru/tag/ukraina)

**German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock says European allies should put more pressure on US President Donald Trump's administration in order to avoid losing Washington as a partner, including in talks on the war in Ukraine.**             

Baerbock said on Friday that in order to keep the US as a partner, rather than an opponent allied with Russia, Europe must put pressure on Trump’s administration.

"We are increasing the pressure on the Americans" in order to show them that "they have a lot to lose if they no longer stand by the liberal democracies of Europe," said Baerbock.

Baerbock warned about the new bilateral talks between Russia and the US that took place earlier this week without the presence of Europeans, which aimed at ending the war in Ukraine.

She claimed that Ukraine and by extension Europe could be forced to make painful concessions in a ceasefire agreement.

According to Baerbock, any ceasefire negation without the participation of Europe or Ukraine is "a peace that is not peace but the opposite, further preparation for even more war and violence."

She emphasized that the ceasefire negotiations must take place with the participation of Ukraine and its allies.

Meanwhile, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday held a phone call conversation, during which the two leaders spoke about "ways to achieve a just peace in Ukraine" as Washington pushed for talks with Moscow without involving Ukraine or Europe.

**Trump increases attacks on Zelensky**

US President Donald Trump continued his attacks on Zelensky on Friday.

Trump’s relentless criticism comes amid a wider policy shift on the conflict from the US that included a bilateral meeting with Russia about a ceasefire deal.

In an interview with Fox Radio, he blamed the Ukrainian leader for the start of the war and its continuation.

He also said Zelensky was negotiating for a ceasefire agreement without having any military or political advantage over Russia.

“He’s been at meetings for three years, and he got nothing, so I don’t think he’s very important to be at meetings, to be honest,” said Trump.

Meanwhile, White House National Security Adviser Mike Waltz said on Friday that he believed Ukraine would soon sign a deal that would grant Washington access to Ukraine’s rare earth minerals in exchange for continued support in the war.

Outgoing German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock on Tuesday called on US President Donald Trump not to force Ukraine into a peace agreement with Russia, after Moscow unilaterally announced a three-day truce for early May.

"It cannot be in the interests of one of the world's biggest players, the US, either, to conclude a deal, a pact, that leads to further aggression," Baerbock said on the sidelines of a meeting on ramping up defence in the Baltic region on Denmark's Bornholm island.

Ministers from the Nordic-Baltic Eight (NB8), along with counterparts from Germany, Poland, and France, are meeting in Bornholm to discuss security and cooperation in the Baltic Sea.

"We need a reliable, lasting peace," Baerbock said, adding that this was what the Europeans stand for.

The German top diplomat also noted recent attacks on data cables in the Baltic Sea, widely attributed to Russia, or the so-called Russian shadow fleet used to circumvent sanctions, as threats to the region.

These hybrid attacks showed that Russian President Vladimir Putin wasn't interested in cooperation but in further aggression, Baerbock said.

"After three years of war, the announcement of a three-day ceasefire cannot hide the fact that the Russian president has set his sight on our European peace order," she warned.

Increased cooperation among Baltic partners was therefore an investment in common security, she added, stressing the importance of strong German leadership to maintain peace in Europe.

Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday unilaterally declared a three-day ceasefire to last from May 8.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
In February 2025, Reuters published an article where German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock stated that there must be no peace in Ukraine over the heads of Ukrainians and Europeans (<image:k>). The Guardian reported on February 12, 2025, that Baerbock said Ukraine’s interests must be protected in the upcoming negotiations between Moscow and Washington (<image:1007>). A Wikipedia article discusses the 2025 Trump–Zelenskyy Oval Office meeting on February 28, 2025, and mentions that Baerbock said Trump's conduct represented a "new era of ruthlessness" (<image:i>).

### Evidence from `web_search`
A fact-check from aol.com, published on March 4, 2025, states that the claim about German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock threatening to cut ties with the US is misleading, stating that she did not threaten to cut diplomatic ties with the U.S. <image:1022>, <image:1023>. An article from Izvestia, dated February 21, 2025, reports that Baerbock called for increased pressure on the U.S. regarding its stance on Ukraine and mentioned severing ties. <image:1048>

Press TV, on February 22, 2025, reports that Baerbock urged European allies to pressure the US under Donald Trump to prevent a US-Russia alliance, particularly regarding the war in Ukraine. <image:1049>, <image:1050>


## Elaboration
The claim is partially supported by the evidence. A fact-check from aol.com states that the claim is misleading, as Baerbock did not threaten to cut diplomatic ties with the U.S. However, an article from Izvestia reports that Baerbock mentioned severing ties. Press TV reports that Baerbock urged European allies to pressure the US under Donald Trump.

The evidence suggests that Baerbock was critical of the US stance on Ukraine and called for increased pressure. However, the claim's veracity depends on the interpretation of "threatened."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that Annalena Baerbock was highly critical of Donald Trump's stance on Ukraine. While one source states that Baerbock did not threaten to cut diplomatic ties, another source mentions her mentioning severing ties. Furthermore, Baerbock warned of a "new era of ruthlessness" and a "new era of profanity" following Trump's actions. The evidence suggests that Baerbock was pressuring the US regarding its stance on Ukraine.

The claim's veracity is uncertain because the evidence is contradictory.

# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The fact-check reveals conflicting information. While some sources indicate that Baerbock did not threaten to sever ties, others suggest she mentioned it or called for increased pressure on the US. The evidence also shows Baerbock's strong criticism of Trump's actions.

Given the conflicting reports, the claim's veracity cannot be definitively determined. `not enough information`

Within just an hour or two of the Oval Office meeting, similar expressions of support and solidarity online came from the Spanish premier, Pedro Sánchez, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda, Latvian Prime Minister Evika Siliņa and President Edgars Rinkēvičs, Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre, Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala and President Petr Pavel and many others, including Australia's premier, Anthony Albanese.

Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson, whose country recently ended centuries of neutrality in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine to join the NATO alliance, said Sweden stood with Ukraine, which was fighting for its own freedom, as well as Europe's.

Germany's current chancellor, Olaf Scholz, and the likely next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, also voiced their support, as Germany's foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said her country and other European allies stood united "alongside Ukraine — and against the Russian aggression." She said Ukraine could rely on "unwavering" support from Berlin, as well as elsewhere in Europe, and minutes later her Dutch counterpart, Caspar Veldkamp, said Kyiv could rely on the Netherlands' support too. He said that countries including France that had helped Ukraine and sanctioned Russia three years ago after its February 2022 invasion were "right" to continue to do so.

### Evidence from `web_search`
A fact-check from aol.com, published on March 4, 2025, states that the claim about German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock threatening to cut ties with the US is misleading, stating that she did not threaten to cut diplomatic ties with the U.S. <image:1022>, <image:1023>. An article from Izvestia, dated February 21, 2025, reports that Baerbock called for increased pressure on the U.S. regarding its stance on Ukraine and mentioned severing ties. <image:1048>

Press TV, on February 22, 2025, reports that Baerbock urged European allies to pressure the US under Donald Trump to prevent a US-Russia alliance, particularly regarding the war in Ukraine. <image:1049>, <image:1050>


## Elaboration
The claim is partially supported by the evidence. A fact-check from aol.com states that the claim is misleading, as Baerbock did not threaten to cut diplomatic ties with the U.S. However, an article from Izvestia reports that Baerbock mentioned severing ties. Press TV reports that Baerbock urged European allies to pressure the US under Donald Trump.

The evidence suggests that Baerbock was critical of the US stance on Ukraine and called for increased pressure. However, the claim's veracity depends on the interpretation of "threatened."

While one source states that Baerbock did not threaten to cut diplomatic ties, another source mentions her mentioning severing ties. Furthermore, Baerbock warned of a "new era of ruthlessness" and a "new era of profanity" following Trump's actions. The evidence suggests that Baerbock was pressuring the US regarding its stance on Ukraine.

The claim's veracity is uncertain because the evidence is contradictory.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Reuters reported on February 13, 2025, that Annalena Baerbock stated that Ukraine and Europe need to be involved in peace talks about Ukraine, after the U.S. President Donald Trump discussed the war in Ukraine with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy (<image:8255>). NPR reported on March 1, 2025, that Baerbock stated that Germany and other European allies stood united "alongside Ukraine — and against the Russian aggression" (<image:8256>, <image:8258>, <image:8261>).

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Annalena Baerbock made several comments regarding Donald Trump's stance on Ukraine in February 2025. She emphasized the need for European involvement in peace talks and criticized Trump's actions. However, the evidence is contradictory regarding whether she threatened to sever ties with the US. One source states that she did not threaten to cut diplomatic ties, while another source mentions her mentioning severing ties.

Therefore, the claim is **partially supported** but remains **unverified** due to conflicting information.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that Annalena Baerbock made several critical comments regarding Donald Trump's stance on Ukraine in February 2025. While she expressed strong opinions and urged European involvement, the evidence is contradictory regarding whether she threatened to sever ties with the US. One source denies the threat, while another suggests it.

`false`

## Summary

The claim is **unverified**. While Annalena Baerbock made critical comments about Donald Trump's stance on Ukraine in February 2025, the evidence is contradictory regarding whether she threatened to sever ties with the US. One source denies the threat, while another suggests it.

Initially, the known number of Ukrainian military casualties varied widely due to the Ukrainian Army drastically understating its casualties,[\[19\]](#cite_note-hides-22)
 as reported by medics, activists and soldiers on the ground, as well as at least one lawmaker.[\[19\]](#cite_note-hides-22)
[\[20\]](#cite_note-23)
[\[21\]](#cite_note-24)
[\[22\]](#cite_note-25)
 Several medical officials reported they were overstretched due to the drastic number of casualties.[\[19\]](#cite_note-hides-22)
 Eventually, the [Ukrainian Defence Ministry](/wiki/Ministry_of_Defence_(Ukraine) "Ministry of Defence (Ukraine)")
 stated that the numbers recorded by the National Museum of Military History were the official ones, although still incomplete,[\[23\]](#cite_note-26)
 with 4,638 deaths (4,500 identified and 138 unidentified) cataloged by 1 December 2021.[\[10\]](#cite_note-memory0-11)
[\[b\]](#cite_note-"memory1-15)

According to the [Armed Forces of Ukraine](/wiki/Armed_Forces_of_Ukraine "Armed Forces of Ukraine")
, 1,175 of the Ukrainian servicemen died due to non-combat causes by 5 March 2021.[\[24\]](#cite_note-27)
 Subsequently, the military did not publish new figures on their non-combat losses, stating they could be considered a state secret.[\[25\]](#cite_note-28)

# Your Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The Wikipedia article "Casualties of the Russo-Ukrainian War" states that in July 2024, a British Army official said that with the current way of fighting, it would cost Russia from 1.5 to 1.8 million casualties. The article also mentions that by the end of 2024, Meduza estimated that over 165,000 Russian soldiers had died during the war. The article also states that as of the beginning of February 2025, 1,382 Russian servicemen that were previously thought missing were confirmed to be in Ukrainian captivity, while the overall number of Russian prisoners of war was thought to be much higher.

Faced with mounting losses in Ukraine, the Russian authorities moved quickly to decide how the deaths of soldiers would be reported. **Russian losses in the war with Ukraine.**  
Mediazona count, updated
======================================================================

_Mediazona,_ in collaboration with _BBC News_ Russian service and a team of volunteers, maintains a named list of deceased Russian military personnel. Here we report what we’ve learned about the losses during this time and the events at the front that led to the deaths of Russian soldiers.

**Interactive Infographics.** The second part showcases visual representations of losses since the beginning of the war: for example, where the deceased served or in which regions they lived. These are absolute numbers, not adjusted for population or number of military units.

On the map, you can choose between total losses and losses by military branch, as well as see where the deceased mobilised soldiers were from.

In most cases, from death reports or indirect signs (uniform or sleeve patches in photos), it’s possible to determine which branch of the military the deceased served in, or how they joined the army (mobilised, volunteer, prisoner, etc.)

We compared these groups of servicemen on a separate graph.

From early summer and into the mid-fall season of 2022, volunteers bore the brunt of the losses, which is strikingly different from the situation in the initial stage of the war: in winter and early spring, the Airborne Forces suffered the greatest damage, followed by the Motorised Rifle troops.

By the end of 2022 and the beginning of the next year, losses among prisoners recruited into the _Wagner PMC_ increased markedly. The children are too young to understand what the plaques mean, but they walk past them all the same.

What we know about losses
-------------------------

Here’s how the losses are distributed across Russian regions. They were formed into “assault groups” to overwhelm Ukrainian positions near Bakhmut.

By March 2023, prisoners became the largest category of war losses. By November 2024, this figure had dropped to between 2–3%—a shift that reflects both evolving combat tactics and the intensive recruitment of volunteer infantry, who suffer casualty rates many times higher than their commanding officers.

**Officers killed in Ukraine**

To date, reports of the deaths of two deputy army commanders have been officially confirmed—Major General Andrei Sukhovetsky of the 41st Army and Major General Vladimir Frolov of the 8th Army.

On May 22, 2022, fighter pilot, 63-year-old retired Major General Kanamat Botashev died; most likely, he went to war as a volunteer. This list is not exhaustive, as not every military death becomes public knowledge.

To provide a more comprehensive picture of the war’s impact, we offer a second figure: an estimate of excess mortality among men, based on Probate registry data. This method was developed in collaboration with _Meduza_, to address the limitations of relying solely on publicly reported deaths.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence presents conflicting information regarding Russian troop losses. The Russia Matters report from February 26, 2025, estimates over 700,000 Russian soldiers killed or injured, with 48,000 missing. A Wikipedia article cites a British Army official estimating 1.5 to 1.8 million casualties by July 2024, and Meduza estimated over 165,000 deaths by the end of 2024.

The claim of 1.5 million troop losses by February 2025 is partially supported by the British Army official's estimate of 1.5 to 1.8 million casualties by July 2024. However, the Russia Matters report and Meduza provide different figures.

The evidence does not provide a definitive number for February 2025, but it does offer estimates from different sources, making it difficult to verify the claim's accuracy.

A video claiming that USAID, the US government's main overseas aid agency, has paid Hollywood celebrities millions of dollars to visit Ukraine has gone viral on social media and has been amplified by high-profile accounts like Elon Musk.

However, the clip is not real and has hallmarks of a Russian disinformation operation that the BBC has previously investigated.

BBC Verify's Olga Robinson explains why.

 appears to feature an audio recording of US President Donald Trump criticising the UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer over aid to Ukraine, energy costs and jobs.

But the audio has been generated by AI and overlaid onto a [video interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g)
 Mr Trump did with podcaster Theo Von on 21 August 2024.

Neither Mr Trump or Mr Von discuss the UK or Ukraine in this video, but instead focus on US healthcare reform, border security and President Trump’s reasons for avoiding drinking and smoking.

**How did we know this was AI-generated?**

We contacted Professor **Hany Farid**, who specialises in digital forensics at the University of California, Berkeley, and is Chief Science Officer at GetReal Labs, a cybersecurity company focused on preventing malicious threats from generative AI.

He told us this is “an obvious—and not particularly well-executed—fake”...

 asked the comedian at one point about his use of cocaine, alcohol and history with addiction.

The latest episode of Von's podcast, "[This Past Weekend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g)
" posted Tuesday and was filmed at the Trump National Golf Club Bedminster in Bedminster, New Jersey.

During the episode, Von asked Trump about not drinking and smoking, to which Trump replied that [he never has](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2018/10/01/donald-trump-beer-joke/1488351002/)
, mentioning his older brother, Fred Trump Jr., who he said had a problem with alcohol.

"I tell people, no drugs, no drinking, no cigarettes," Trump said. "I tell that to my kids all the time, I say 'no drugs, no drinking, no smoking.'"

Trump said he looked up to and admired his brother, who died in 1981, calling him an "incredible personality." He added that he's heard alcohol is "tougher to get off of than drugs," to which Von said that he himself is in recovery from drug and alcohol use.

The former president discussed a variety of other topics during the episode, including his relationship with his family, health care, lobbying, President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris and the 2024 presidential election.

**2024 Presidential Election:** [Donald Trump (pretty much) sticks to the script on Harris. Von said, "No, it's horrible, but you do it anyway, just like the guy you're saying with the scotch," referring to an earlier conversation about alcohol.

Trump asked Von which substance he thought was a bigger problem in the U.S.: alcohol or opioids, to which Von responded opioids.

Content: "Greene's trades have often drawn red flags due to her committee roles and the timing of the trades.

Musk's comments on Congressional wealth comes after former President **Joe Biden** supported a ban on Congress trading last year.

"Nobody in the Congress should be able to make money in the stock market while they're in the Congress," Biden said in an interview.

Biden said he was able to live on a Congressional salary and not worry about becoming rich through playing the stock market previously.

Representative **Ro Khanna** (D-Calif.) [previously told Benzinga](https://www.benzinga.com/general/politics/24/05/39096827/exclusive-khanna-says-shameful-congress-members-profited-from-stocks-calls-for-trading-ban-makin?utm_campaign=partner_feed&utm_source=yahooFinance&utm_medium=partner_feed&utm_content=site&nid=43707262)
 that he will continue to advocate for a vote to ban the practice.

“We should have a vote on it,” Khanna told Benzinga.

Khanna said that despite his continued speeches in the House advocating for a ban on stock trading, there is a “collective shrug” in Congress regarding the issue.

"It is shameful that over three years after the pandemic with the shenanigans from those senators who sold their stock after learning of the pandemic" there still hasn't been a vote, Khanna said.

Khanna said that people were outraged at the time when several senators sold their stocks in tourism and other sectors that would be hurt, knowing that the economy could crash from the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Senators making money when the rest of the country was suffering during the pandemic."

 in 2023 through a collaboration with Subversive. Does anyone know?" Musk tweeted.

The quoted tweet included the following members of Congress:

*   **Nancy Pelosi** (D-Calif.): Annual salary $223,000, Net worth $202 million
    
*   **Mitch McConnell** (R-Ky.): Annual salary $200,000, Net worth $95 million
    
*   **Chuck Schumer** (D-N.Y.): Annual salary $210,000, Net worth $75 million
    
*   **Elizabeth Warren** (D-Mass.): Annual salary: $285,000, Net worth $67 million
    

The replies included a post from the original poster with additional examples of politicians who have net worths of more than $50 million.

"I am not suggesting anything. While the former speaker of the house has been accused of providing insider information to her husband in the past, her husband makes investments as part of his career.

People in the comments were quick to point out inaccuracies in the net worth amounts with Warren estimated to be worth significantly less than this amount.

Story Continues

**Why It's Important:** Musk's post took aim at members of Congress regardless of their political party.

In comments made alongside **Donald Trump,** Musk said he questions how members of Congress are getting significantly wealthier while in office, while joking that maybe they're just good at investing.

"I think the reality is they're getting wealthier to taxpayer expense," Musk said.

An investigation into members of Congress and their investing activity and payments made by special interest groups while in office could reveal that members of both the Republican and Democratic parties made questionable moves to help boost their wealth.

This could be an interesting move by Musk, who is currently aligned with the Republican party and has the support of many Republican members of Congress.

The Unusual Whales congressional trading report for 2024 showed that Democrats averaged a 31.1% return in 2024 and Republicans averaged a 26.1% return versus the S&P 500 at 24.9%.

The top 10 traders in 2024 list was made up of six Republicans and four Democrats with five Congress members having returns of more than 100% in 2024.

Of the individuals listed in Musk's quoted tweet above, Pelosi ranked 10th in 2024 at +70.9%. Oops, something went wrong

Elon Musk Questions Congress Members' Wealth: 'Where Did They Get All The Money?'
=================================================================================

[Chris Katje](/author/)

Thu, Feb 13, 2025, 8:00 PM 5 min read

Billionaire **Elon Musk** targeted members of Congress who enjoy rising wealth amounts while in office, which comes as retail traders place larger emphasis on politicians’ [stock and options trading activity.](https://www.benzinga.com/topic/congress-trading?utm_campaign=partner_feed&utm_source=yahooFinance&utm_medium=partner_feed&utm_content=site&nid=43707262)

**What Happened:** Members of Congress can buy and sell stocks, options and cryptocurrency as long as they disclose the transactions in a timely manner.

This activity has drawn increased scrutiny in recent years as trades made by members of Congress often appear to be conflicts of interest based on non-public knowledge and can sometimes be stocks related to government-funded contracts.

     **Here’s what Americans think you need to be considered wealthy.**
    

A post that discussed several prominent members of Congress with their annual salaries and net worths caught the attention of Musk, who is currently the world's richest person worth $379 billion.

"It's not like these politicians started companies or were NBA All-Stars, so where did they get all the money? Make your own conclusions," the poster tweeted.

The annual salaries in the post could include other sources of income and may not be strictly their Congressional salary.

The post also doesn't take into account how much the net worth of members of Congress was before they took office or what their spouses do.

Financial disclosures show that Pelosi has millions of dollars in real estate investments, business partnerships and stock holdings.

A Napa, California, home and vineyard the California Democrat owns is worth between $5 million and $25 million and generated between $100,001 and $1 million in income from grape sales, according to her 2019 report.

The couple also own several commercial properties that generate rental income in that same range and hold investments in undeveloped real estate.

While assets listed on the form total between $57 million and $271 million, liabilities range from $20 million to $97 million. Liabilities include multimillion-dollar mortgages on several properties and equity credit lines.

Pelosi’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The claim: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has amassed more than $196 million in wealth working on a congressional salary of $193,400
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is one of the richest members of Congress, but a social media post circulating about the wealth she has built while earning a congressional salary is wrong about her net worth.

The post claims Pelosi has been in office for 28 years, during which she earned $193,400 per year. <image:1238>

Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., gavels in the final vote of the impeachment of President Donald Trump, for his role in inciting an angry mob to storm the Congress last week, at the Capitol in Washington, Wednesday, Jan. 20, 2021, in Washington.

Fact check: No, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi isn't worth $196 million

Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., gavels in the final vote of the impeachment of President Donald Trump, for his role in inciting an angry mob to storm the Congress last week, at the Capitol in Washington, Wednesday, Jan. That’s about $90 million less than the figure cited in the meme.

Where is all that money coming from?

Pelosi has been in Congress since 1987, when [members were paid $89,500.](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/97-1011.pdf)
 Today, as [speaker, Pelosi earns $223,500.](https://pressgallery.house.gov/member-data/salaries)
 As minority leader, Pelosi would have earned the $193,400 spelled out in the meme.

But her salary from a 34-year career in Congress, including 18 years as minority leader and speaker, doesn’t tell the whole story about the personal wealth she and her husband have built.

[Two polls](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/02/post-debate-polls-bad-news-biden-00166395)
 out on July 3, 2024 – both taken after last Thursday’s presidential debate – show that more voters are now supporting former President Donald Trump over President Joe Biden. Biden, 81, [is the first octogenarian to occupy](https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/20/politics/joe-biden-80th-birthday/index.html)
 the Oval Office – and his main rival, former President Donald Trump, is 78.

I [first wrote about most](https://theconversation.com/why-are-us-politicians-so-old-and-why-do-they-want-to-stay-in-office-217024)
 voters’ concerns about the presidential candidates’ ages in the fall of 2023 – and since then, those concerns have only grown. It’s a bipartisan trend: Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, is 72, and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, is 81. Bernie Sanders is 81 and hasn’t mentioned retirement at all.

In the House, California Democrat and former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, at age 84, is running for reelection for her 19th [full term in office](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-house-speaker-pelosi-seek-re-election-reversing-earlier-plan-2022-01-25/)
. Mitch McConnell appeared to freeze while speaking with the media, raising questions about his age and health. The news comes amid a [barrage of media reports](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/02/democrats-biden-debate-fallout-00166208)
 that leading Democrats are questioning Biden’s abilities and stamina because of his age. In February, special counsel Robert Hur [declined to charge Biden with mishandling classified](https://apnews.com/article/biden-memory-age-special-counsel-report-doj-f4232bc8316e556ed467185b67c3e0a8)
 documents because he presents as an “elderly man with a poor memory,” he wrote. The report caused outrage among some Democrats at the time.

A [Gallup Poll released in June 2024](https://news.gallup.com/poll/646547/age-issues-working-trump-advantage-pre-debate.aspx)
 found that about 67% of Americans say Biden is too old to be president."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence provides information about the wealth of several US politicians, including Joe Biden, Mitch McConnell, Nancy Pelosi, and others. However, the evidence does not mention any list released by Ukraine or any bribes taken by US politicians from Ukraine. Therefore, the claim that the image shows an authentic list released by Ukraine showing US politicians taking bribes from Ukraine cannot be verified with the provided evidence. The evidence does not contain any information about the image's authenticity or the source of the data presented in the image.

Macron warns against 'escalation' after Biden brands Putin 'butcher'
====================================================================

Kyiv (AFP) – France's President Emmanuel Macron warned Sunday against a verbal "escalation" of Russia's invasion in Ukraine, after US President Joe Biden branded Vladimir Putin a "butcher" who "cannot remain in power".

 ![Macron warns against 'escalation' after Biden brands Putin 'butcher'](https://s.france24.com/media/display/99f8a93a-e6c1-11ee-9116-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/img-default-F24.jpg)

The Kremlin had reacted in fury over Biden's comments which it said narrows the window for bilateral relations, with Russia's invasion of Ukraine now into a second month.

Macron said he would speak to Putin in the next two days to organise the evacuation of civilians from the heavily bombarded port city of Mariupol.

The French leader told broadcaster France 3 that he saw his task as "achieving first a ceasefire and then the total withdrawal of (Russian) troops by diplomatic means."

"If we want to do that, we can't escalate either in words or actions."

Ukraine was making a new push to get civilians out of the city on Sunday, with an aid route agreement for people to leave by cars or on evacuation buses, said Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk.

Several attempts at establishing safe routes for civilians to flee have collapsed as both sides trade blame for violating temporary ceasefires.

Mariupol, in the region of Donetsk, has borne the brunt of Russia's assaults, and residents who managed to flee have recounted harrowing scenes of death and destruction.

About 170,000 people remain trapped in the besieged city and authorities have said they fear some 300 civilians may have died in a Russian strike on March 17 that hit a theatre being used as a bomb shelter.

Several attempts at establishing safe routes for civilians to flee have collapsed as both sides trade blame for violating temporary ceasefires FADEL SENNA AFP

In an impassioned speech from the Royal Castle in Warsaw, Biden blasted Putin over Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

"For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power," the US leader said, before the White House clarified that Washington was not seeking regime change.

The Kremlin snapped back, saying "a head of state should stay sober".

'Going to die anyway'
---------------------

Personal attacks, said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, were "narrowing down the window of opportunity" for bilateral relations.

"Biden is weak, sick and unhappy," said Vyacheslav Volodin, president of the lower house of parliament.

Putin sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, vowing to destroy the country's military and topple pro-Western President Volodymyr Zelensky.

But his army has made little progress on capturing key cities, and it has hit hospitals, residential buildings and schools in increasingly deadly attacks on civilians.

In Kharkiv, where authorities reported 44 artillery strikes and 140 rocket assaults in a single day, residents were resigned to the incessant bombardments.

Anna Kolinichenko, who lives in a three-room flat with her sister and brother-in-law, said they do not even bother to head down to the cellar when the sirens go off.

"If a bomb drops, we're going to die anyway," she told AFP. Like a volcano is exploding, as if the earth explodes," she said as she rested on a chair at an evacuation centre on the outskirts of Kyiv.

Recapture town

"I write poems and when there are explosions I feel great inspiration."

Bombardments continued over the last 24 hours in Irpin, as well as other cities around Kyiv, said Ukrainian authorities.

With the conflict now into a second month, Ukraine's determined fighters continue to hold back Russia's far-bigger military Aleksey Filippov AFP

Ukraine's determined fighters continue to hold back Russia's far-bigger military on the frontlines, and some units are beginning to snatch back control.

Two people were killed by shelling in the village of Stanislav, close to the city of Kherson, where Ukrainian forces have mounted a counter-offensive.

In an update early Sunday, the Ukrainian General Staff said "the allied forces repulsed seven attacks" and destroyed eight tanks in the Donetsk and Lugansk areas of the Donbas.

The Ukrainian defence ministry said its forces had also recaptured Trostianets, a town near the Russian border that was one of the first to fall under Moscow's control.

Images published by the ministry showed Ukrainian soldiers and civilians among heavily damaged buildings and what appeared to be abandoned Russian military equipment.

Elsewhere, Russian forces took control of Slavutych, the town where workers at the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear plant live, briefly detaining the mayor, Ukrainian authorities said.

Residents of the town protested, prompting the Russians to fire shots in the air and lob stun grenades into the crowd, they added.

The International Atomic Energy Agency said it was "closely monitoring the situation" and was concerned about the ability of employees at Chernobyl to rotate and return to their homes to rest.

'One percent'
-------------

"There has been no staff rotation at the NPP for nearly a week now," the IAEA said.

Russia's army, which Western analysts said appeared bogged down by tactical, communications and logistics problems, had suggested on Friday it would shift its concentration to eastern Ukraine.

But Biden had cast doubt, saying he was "not sure" Moscow has indeed changed its objectives.

Biden, who was winding up a whirlwind visit to Poland after holding a series of urgent summits in Brussels with Western allies, met key Ukrainian cabinet ministers on Saturday.

In a possible shift on a plan to transfer Soviet-era fighter jets from Poland to Kyiv to boost Ukraine's firepower in the skies -- rejected last month by the Pentagon as too "high risk" -- Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the United States now did not object.

"As far as we can conclude, the ball is now on the Polish side," Kuleba said in written comments to AFP after the meeting.

In a video address, Zelensky reiterated a call for planes while urging allies to supply Ukraine with more weapons.

"During the meeting..."

**What was claimed:** A video shows the president of France, Emmanuel Macron, calling Vladimir Putin a “butcher” and commenting on his “war crimes” during a press conference with US president Donald Trump.

**Our verdict:** This isn’t quite right. Mr Macron referred to killings in the Ukrainian town of Bucha and mentioned war crimes, but did not describe President Putin as a “butcher”.

French President Emmanuel Macron Olivier Hoslet / Pool / EPA / TASS

France's President Emmanuel Macron warned Sunday against a verbal "escalation" of Russia's invasion in Ukraine, after US President Joe Biden branded Vladimir Putin a "butcher" who "cannot remain in power."

The Kremlin had reacted in fury over Biden's comments which it said narrows the window for bilateral relations, with Russia's invasion of Ukraine now into a second month.

Macron said he would speak to Putin in the next two days to organize the evacuation of civilians from the heavily bombarded port city of Mariupol.

The French leader told broadcaster France 3 that he saw his task as "achieving first a ceasefire and then the total withdrawal of (Russian) troops by diplomatic means."

"If we want to do that, we can't escalate either in words or actions."

Ukraine was making a new push to get civilians out of the city on Sunday, with an aid route agreement for people to leave by cars or on evacuation buses, said Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk.

Several attempts at establishing safe routes for civilians to flee have collapsed as both sides trade blame for violating temporary ceasefires.

Mariupol, in the region of Donetsk, has borne the brunt of Russia's assaults, and residents who managed to flee have recounted harrowing scenes of death and destruction.

About 170,000 people remain trapped in the besieged city and authorities have said they fear some 300 civilians may have died in a Russian strike on March 17 that hit a theatre being used as a bomb shelter.

In an impassioned speech from the Royal Castle in Warsaw, Biden blasted Putin over Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

"For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power," the US leader said, before the White House clarified that Washington was not seeking regime change.

The Kremlin snapped back, saying "a head of state should stay sober."

### **“Going to die anyway”**

Personal attacks, said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, were "narrowing down the window of opportunity" for bilateral relations.

"Biden is weak, sick and unhappy," said Vyacheslav Volodin, president of the lower house of parliament.

Putin sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, vowing to destroy the country's military and topple pro-Western President Volodymyr Zelensky.

But his army has made little progress on capturing key cities, and it has hit hospitals, residential buildings and schools in increasingly deadly attacks on civilians.

In Kharkiv, where authorities reported 44 artillery strikes and 140 rocket assaults in a single day, residents were resigned to the incessant bombardments.

Anna Kolinichenko, who lives in a three-room flat with her sister and brother-in-law, said they do not even bother to head down to the cellar when the sirens go off.

"If a bomb drops, we're going to die anyway," she told AFP. <image:1440>\

### **Recapture town**

"I write poems and when there are explosions I feel great inspiration."

Bombardments continued over the last 24 hours in Irpin, as well as other cities around Kyiv, said Ukrainian authorities.

Ukraine's determined fighters continue to hold back Russia's far-bigger military on the frontlines, and some units are beginning to snatch back control.

Two people were killed by shelling in the village of Stanislav, close to the city of Kherson, where Ukrainian forces have mounted a counter-offensive.

In an update early Sunday, the Ukrainian General Staff said "the allied forces repulsed seven attacks" and destroyed eight tanks in the Donetsk and Lugansk areas of the Donbas.

The Ukrainian defense ministry said its forces had also recaptured Trostianets, a town near the Russian border that was one of the first to fall under Moscow's control.

Images published by the ministry showed Ukrainian soldiers and civilians among heavily damaged buildings and what appeared to be abandoned Russian military equipment.

Elsewhere, Russian forces took control of Slavutych, the town where workers at the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear plant live, briefly detaining the mayor, Ukrainian authorities said.

Residents of the town protested, prompting the Russians to fire shots in the air and lob stun grenades into the crowd, they added.

The International Atomic Energy Agency said it was "closely monitoring the situation" and was concerned about the ability of employees at Chernobyl to rotate and return to their homes to rest.

### **"One percent"**

"There has been no staff rotation at the NPP for nearly a week now," the IAEA said.

Russia's army, which Western analysts said appeared bogged down by tactical, communications and logistics problems, had suggested on Friday it would shift its concentration to eastern Ukraine.

But Biden had cast doubt, saying he was "not sure" Moscow has indeed changed its objectives.

Biden, who was winding up a whirlwind visit to Poland after holding a series of urgent summits in Brussels with Western allies, met key Ukrainian cabinet ministers on Saturday.

In a possible shift on a plan to transfer Soviet-era fighter jets from Poland to Kyiv to boost Ukraine's firepower in the skies -- rejected last month by the Pentagon as too "high risk" — Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the United States now did not object.

"As far as we can conclude, the ball is now on the Polish side," Kuleba said in written comments to AFP after the meeting.

In a video address, Zelensky reiterated a call for planes while urging allies to supply Ukraine with more weapons.

Main article: [Soviet–Japanese War § Summary](/wiki/Soviet%E2%80%93Japanese_War#Summary "Soviet–Japanese War")

As agreed with the United Kingdom and the United States (Western Allies) at the [Tehran Conference](/wiki/Tehran_Conference "Tehran Conference")
 in November 1943 and the [Yalta Conference](/wiki/Yalta_Conference "Yalta Conference")
 in February 1945, the [Soviet Union](/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union")
 entered World War II's [Pacific Theatre](/wiki/Pacific_War "Pacific War")
 within three months of the [end of the war in Europe](/wiki/Victory_in_Europe_Day "Victory in Europe Day")
. The Japanese did not have any concrete evidence as to when or where any invasion would occur.[\[17\]](#cite_note-Drea-24)
 They had estimated that an attack was not likely before the spring of 1946, but the _[Stavka](/wiki/Stavka "Stavka")
_ had in fact been planning for a mid-August offensive, successfully [concealing the buildup](/wiki/Russian_military_deception "Russian military deception")
 of a force of 90 divisions. This secondary objective was to be carried out by the [25th Army](/wiki/25th_Army_(Soviet_Union) "25th Army (Soviet Union)")
.[\[1\]](#cite_note-Glantz-1)
 Meanwhile, the [35th Army](/wiki/35th_Army_(Russia) "35th Army (Russia)")
 was tasked with capturing the cities of [Boli](/wiki/Boli_County "Boli County")
 (or Poli), [Linkou](/w/index.php?title=Linkou,_Heilongjiang&action=edit&redlink=1 "Linkou, Heilongjiang (page does not exist)")

#### 2nd Far Eastern Front

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Soviet_invasion_of_Manchuria&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: 2nd Far Eastern Front")\
\]

The 2nd Far Eastern Front, under General [Maksim Purkayev](/wiki/Maksim_Purkayev "Maksim Purkayev")
, included:[\[1\]](#cite_note-Glantz-1)

*   [2nd Red Banner Army](/wiki/Soviet_Second_Army "Soviet Second Army")

*   [16th Army](/wiki/16th_Army_(Soviet_Union) "16th Army (Soviet Union)")
     (whose 56th Rifle Corps was its only formation to see combat, on [South Sakhalin](/wiki/South_Sakhalin "South Sakhalin")
    )
*   [5th Separate Rifle Corps](/wiki/5th_Separate_Rifle_Corps "5th Separate Rifle Corps")

*   [10th Air Army](/wiki/10th_Air_Army "10th Air Army")
    

The 2nd Far Eastern Front was deployed in a supporting attack role.[\[1\]](#cite_note-Glantz-1)
 Its objectives were the cities of Harbin and Qiqihar,[\[2\]](#cite_note-Battlefield_Series-2)
 and to prevent an orderly withdrawal to the south by the Japanese forces.[\[1\]](#cite_note-Glantz-1)
 The front also included the [88th Separate Rifle Brigade](/wiki/88th_Separate_Rifle_Brigade "88th Separate Rifle Brigade")
, composed of Chinese and Korean guerrillas of the [Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army](/wiki/Northeast_Anti-Japanese_United_Army "Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army")
 who had retreated into the USSR in the beginning of the 1940s. The Kwantung Army commanders were engaged in a planning exercise at the time of the invasion, and were away from their forces for the first eighteen hours of conflict.

In the closing decades of the 19th century, foreign powers, particularly [Russia](https://www.britannica.com/place/Russia)
 and [Japan](https://www.britannica.com/place/Japan)

. As the prize of its victory in the [Sino-Japanese War](https://www.britannica.com/event/First-Sino-Japanese-War-1894-1895)
 of 1894–95, Japan demanded from [China](https://www.britannica.com/place/China)
 the cession of the Liaodong Peninsula. But Russia, backed by France and Germany, compelled Japan to abandon this claim. By means of intrigue and intimidation, Russia then (in 1898) acquired from China a 25-year lease of the Liaodong Peninsula and the right to build a connecting railway from the ports of Dairen (Dalian) and Port Arthur (Lüshun) to the [Chinese Eastern Railway](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Chinese-Eastern-Railway)
. The clash of Russian and Japanese interests in Manchuria and Korea led to the outbreak of the [Russo-Japanese War](https://www.britannica.com/event/Russo-Japanese-War)
 of 1904–05. After its defeat, Russia ceded to Japan all its interests in southern Manchuria.

The Joint Sea-2025 exercises began in waters near the Russian port of Vladivostok and will last for three days, China’s Ministry of National Defence said in a statement on Sunday.

The two sides will hold “submarine rescue, joint anti-submarine, air defence and anti-missile operations, and maritime combat”.

Four Chinese vessels, including guided-missile destroyers Shaoxing and Urumqi, are participating in the exercises, alongside Russian ships, the ministry said.

After the drills, the two countries will conduct naval patrols in “relevant waters of the Pacific”.

China and Russia have carried out annual drills for several years, with the “Joint Sea” exercises beginning in 2012.

Last year’s drills were held along China’s southern coast.

With this year’s drills in the Sea of Japan, in its annual report last month, Japan’s Ministry of Defence warned that China’s growing military cooperation with Russia poses serious security concerns.

“The exercise is defensive in nature and is not directed against other countries,” the Russian Navy Pacific Fleet said earlier this week, according to a report by the US Naval Institute’s online news and analysis portal.

On Friday, the Chinese Defence Ministry said this year’s exercises were aimed at “further deepening the comprehensive strategic partnership” of the two countries.

China has never denounced Russia’s more than three-year [war](/video/newsfeed/2025/8/3/ukraine-claims-drone-strike-on-oil-refinery-in-russia)
 nor called for it to withdraw its troops, and many of Ukraine’s allies, including the US, believe that Beijing has provided support to Moscow.

European leaders asked China last month to use its influence to pressure Russia to end the war, now in its fourth year, but there was no sign that Beijing would do so.

China, however, insists it is a neutral party, regularly calling for an end to the fighting while also accusing Western countries of prolonging the conflict by arming Ukraine.

Clips of Hegseth calling Vladimir Putin a "war criminal" appeared online after he was nominated as secretary of defense by President-elect Donald Trump. Think about it through the psychology of him."

The Facts

While Hegseth aligned with the claim that Putin was a "war criminal," the clip shared online was from March 2022 not long after the outbreak of the conflict.

Since then Hegseth has been more cautious, and critical of the U.S. spending on the conflict, claims appeared on social media repeating comments Hegseth had made criticizing Russian President [Vladimir Putin](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/vladimir-putin)
 in bold terms.

!Pete Hegseth <image:2703>

Pete Hegseth on May 31, 2019, in New York City. intervention in Ukraine and the prognosis from others that Russia's intervention would lead to wider conflict.

In an episode of the _Shawn Ryan Show_ Podcast from November 2024, Hegseth said he did not see Putin taking the world into a wider global or nuclear conflict, saying his gains would be incremental, part of what he called a "get my s\*\*\* back" conflict.

"I found it overinflated from the beginning this idea that Vladimir Putin's attack on Ukraine was going to lead to nuclear war or war across the continent," Hegseth said.

"I've always felt like it was from the beginning, like a couple days in, I like, this feels like the Putin's 'give me my s\*\*\* back' war.

"It kind of feels like \[Putin thought\] 'I feel like you've been pushing pretty hard, and we used to have the former Soviet Union, and we're pretty proud of that, and Ukraine was a part of it, and all these other... I think he probably knows enough to know that it's probably not going much further than Ukraine.

"And I don't think he's a suicidal maniac who's hell-bent on bringing in armageddon with nuclear warfare."

Elsewhere, he has also defended Trump's comment in 2022 calling Putin "very savvy" after the Russian president announced Moscow's recognition of the independence of [two self-proclaimed republics](https://www.newsweek.com/blinken-says-swift-response-needed-russia-recognizing-new-republics-1681212)
 in eastern Ukraine.

While the White House and the [EU](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/eu)
 described Putin's actions as a violation of international law and a pretext for an invasion, Trump said [Putin's move was "genius" and "very savvy."](https://www.newsweek.com/trump-calls-putin-moving-troops-ukraine-peacekeeping-genius-1681557)

Hegseth defended the comments saying that Trump was trying to tease the media for obsessing over the Russian leader

"Here's the reality, Vladimir Putin lives rent-free in the minds of our media, of the American media," Hegseth said.

"No organism, no entity has done more to spread Russian propaganda and to prop up the strawman that is Vladimir Putin than our very own media."

In a [Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/video/6320895317112)
 interview in February 2023 with South Carolina [Republican](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/republican)
 Representative [Nancy Mace](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/nancy-mace)
, Hegseth criticized the number of times President [Joe Biden](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/joe-biden)
 had visited Ukraine compared to the southern border of the U.S., and the "billions spent in Ukraine" suggesting he was ignoring "our problems at home."

He also asked "what do we get out of" the billions the U.S."

Trump this week suggested NATO enlargement provoked Russia to invade Ukraine, but Wicker didn't agree.

“There are good guys and bad guys in this war, and the Russians are the bad guys,” Wicker said. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth made a “rookie mistake” when he said a return to Ukraine’s pre-war borders was “unrealistic,” Senate Armed Services Chair Roger Wicker said Friday.

Hegseth on Thursday [pulled back some of the comments](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/13/hegseth-pull-back-00204088)
 he made about Ukraine a day earlier, where he said that NATO membership for Kyiv was off the table and that the country could not return to its internationally recognized borders. 

“Hegseth is going to be a great defense secretary, although he wasn’t my choice for the job,” the Mississippi Republican [told POLITICO on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference](https://www.politico.eu/politico-munich-security-conference-2025/)
. Wicker said he favors a firm posture with Moscow.

“Everybody knows … and people in the administration know you don't say before your first meeting what you will agree to and what you won't agree to,” Wicker said, adding that he was “puzzled” and “disturbed” by Hegseth’s comments.

President Donald Trump this week held a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on ending the war; Vice President JD Vance will meet in Munich Friday with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Hegseth wasn't freelancing. “But he made a rookie mistake in Brussels and he’s walked back some of what he said but not that line."

"I don’t know who wrote the speech — it is the kind of thing Tucker Carlson could have written, and Carlson is a fool," Wicker said, referring to the pro-Putin broadcaster.

Speaking to Jonathan Martin at the POLITICO Pub in the Munich conference, Wicker — a staunch Ukraine supporter — said he was “surprised” by Hegseth’s original comments and “heartened” that the new defense secretary had reversed course. Trump on Thursday said there was a "good possibility of ending that horrible, very bloody war." He also said it was not "practical" for Kyiv to join NATO and "unlikely" that Ukraine could return to its 2014 pre-invasion borders.

The direct talks between Trump and Putin have left European allies rattled that the EU and Ukraine could be sidelined in any peace deal.

Amid Trump’s talks with Putin, Wicker took a more hawkish stance that is in line with traditional Republican views. resolve, arguing that failing to arm Ukraine could force American troops into future wars.

On Friday, Wicker also called for the U.S."

 of Kentucky, one of three Republicans who voted against Hegseth’s confirmation, who warned, "America’s reputation is on the line."

McConnell, now chair of the panel overseeing defense funding, issued some of his strongest public criticism yet, questioning whether the United States would continue defending democratic allies against authoritarian threats.

He contrasted his stance — rooted in a Reagan-era commitment to global leadership — with Hegseth’s "America First" approach favored by many Trump supporters. "We don’t want a headline at the end of this conflict that says [Russia](https://kyivindependent.com/tag/russia/)
 wins and America loses," McConnell said.

When asked who the aggressor in the three-year-old war is, [Hegseth](https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-bracing-for-painful-reduction-in-us-military-aid-after-hegseth-announces-cuts/)
 responded, "Russia is the aggressor." But he avoided directly stating which side the U.S. wants to see win, instead emphasizing that President Trump is committed to achieving peace.

Ukrainian drones strike a major military depot in a Russian town northwest of Moscow
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

         ![This combo picture shows two satellite images of an ammunition depot in Toropets, Russia, on Saturday Sept. diplomat said [Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-kursk-incursion-gamble-battlefield-e862afd58c65d6d2d5b7b3747423ca4d)
 has a workable plan to end the war, now in its third year, although its details have not been publicly disclosed.

Ukraine claimed the strike destroyed military warehouses in Toropets, a town in Russia’s Tver region about 380 kilometers (240 miles) northwest of Moscow and about 500 kilometers (300 miles) from the border with Ukraine.

The attack was carried out by Ukraine’s Security Service, along with Ukraine’s Intelligence and Special Operations Forces, a Kyiv security official told The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the operation.

According to the official, the depot housed Iskander and Tochka-U missiles, as well as glide bombs and artillery shells.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image's geolocation data suggests it was most likely taken in Ukraine or Russia. The image search results provide context, including an article from The Telegraph on August 14, 2024, about Ukraine seizing land in the border region. This aligns with the claim's timeframe of August 2024. The presence of an American flag on the soldiers' uniforms, as seen in the image, supports the claim of American involvement.

However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that the individuals in the image are mercenaries. The Telegraph article mentions Ukrainian servicemen, but it does not specify their nationality. Further information is needed to confirm the claim that the individuals are American mercenaries.

The evidence does not provide information about the incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast.

Experts told _Newsweek_ that, even if an American PMC were operational in Kursk, it would not equate to Ukraine's raid being conducted under the direction or patronage of the Biden administration, as alleged by the Foreign Ministry.

Helene Olsen, a lecturer in defense studies at King's College London and an expert in the usa of mercenaries and other forms of private contractors in conflict, told _Newsweek_ that it is in the nature of PMCs to "go where the money is."

"While American PMCs traditionally have worked closely with the US Gov and many American PMCs have interests that align with the US Gov, PMCs, irrespective of origin, are ultimately businesses," Olsen said, adding that Russia "would benefit from making up these allegations considering the stigma connected with the private military industry."

According to a release on its website, the ministry expressed its "strong protest" to Holmes "in connection with provocative actions of American reporters who illegally infiltrated Kursk Oblast for propagandist reporting of crimes of Kyiv's regime."

The ministry also claimed to have seen evidence "of the participation of an American \[private military company\] on the side of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the invasion of the territory of the Russian Federation."

 declining to say more than that the operation was "creating a real dilemma for Putin."

According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, however, the involvement of an American PMC in these operations ran "counter to the Biden administration's assertions that it was allegedly not involved in the attack by Ukrainian neo-Nazis on Russia" and that this proved "the United States, as a direct participant in the conflict, is involved in Vladimir Zelensky's malicious plans."

The ministry went on to say that an investigation would be launched into the "American citizens involved in these crimes." It added that those who cross over into Russian territory "automatically become a legitimate military target for the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation."

Eugenio Cusumano, associate professor of political science at the University of Messina, Italy, believes that Russia's allegations of American PMC presence in Kursk is "rather unlikely."

"Russia has repeatedly stated [NATO](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/nato)

Even if proven true, he added that the "the scale and impact of US contractors' involvement is most likely minimal," and that the presence of "a private firm serving private objectives" would not constitute America's direct involvement in Kursk.

Keir Giles, senior research fellow at Chatham House's Russia & Eurasia Program, was less skeptical of the Foreign Ministry's claim, given that "large numbers of foreign volunteers are fighting alongside and supporting Ukrainian forces, Americans among them."

The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Ukraine': 0.69, 'Russia': 0.26, 'Estonia': 0.02, 'Sweden': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0, 'Austria': 0.0, 'Bangladesh': 0.0}

### Evidence from `image_search`
Al Jazeera published an article on March 13, 2025, about Russian forces recapturing Kursk. [<image:2749>](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/13/russian-forces-recapture-kursk-raising-questions-about-us-ukraine-cutoff) The BBC News website contains an image of Ukrainian soldiers.

The Telegraph published an article on August 14, 2024, about Ukraine seizing land in the border region, including a photograph of Ukrainian servicemen near the Russian border. [<image:2751>](https://www.ukrainianphotographers.com/en/news-articles/foreign-mercenaries-in-the-kursk-region)


## Elaboration
The image's geolocation data suggests it was most likely taken in Ukraine or Russia. The image search results provide context, including an article from The Telegraph on August 14, 2024, about Ukraine seizing land in the border region. This aligns with the claim's timeframe of August 2024. The presence of an American flag on the soldiers' uniforms, as seen in the image, supports the claim of American involvement.

However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that the individuals in the image are mercenaries. The Telegraph article mentions Ukrainian servicemen, but it does not specify their nationality. Further information is needed to confirm the claim that the individuals are American mercenaries.

The evidence does not provide information about the incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast.

*   Russian Foreign Ministry summons US Charge d'affaires in Moscow Stephanie Holmes to convey strong protest against 'provocative actions of American reporters' and 'participation of the American PMCs'   

**MOSCOW** 

Russia protested on Tuesday that US private military companies (PMCs) are fighting alongside Ukraine in the Kursk region, while reporters from several major American media outlets illegally entered Russian territory to cover the incursion. 

The Russian Foreign Ministry claimed in a statement that soldiers from US private military companies are fighting alongside Ukrainian troops in the Kursk region, and journalists illegally entered Russian territory to cover the incursion.

US Charge d'affaires Stephanie Holmes was summoned to the Foreign Ministry in Moscow to convey strong protest against the "provocative actions of American reporters" and "participation of the American PMCs on the side of Ukraine's armed forces during their invasion" of Russia, it said.

"Such actions are contradicting statements by Joe Biden administration about non-involvement in Ukraine's neo-Nazi attack against Russia, proving with all clarity US involvement as a direct participant of the conflict in (Ukraine's President Volodymyr) Zelenskyy's malicious intentions," the ministry stressed.

The ministry warned that Russian law enforcement will investigate US citizens’ actions and take necessary measures to bring them to justice.

"All foreign 'specialists' and mercenaries illegally crossing the border of our country automatically become a legitimate military target for the armed forces of the Russian Federation," it said.

Kyiv's incursion into the Kursk region began on the night of August 5-6, when Ukrainian forces entered near Sudzha. **Please contact us for subscription options.**](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/p/subscription/1001)

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Ukraine': 0.69, 'Russia': 0.26, 'Estonia': 0.02, 'Sweden': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0, 'Austria': 0.0, 'Bangladesh': 0.0}

### Evidence from `image_search`
Al Jazeera published an article on March 13, 2025, about Russian forces recapturing Kursk. [<image:2749>](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/13/russian-forces-recapture-kursk-raising-questions-about-us-ukraine-cutoff) The BBC News website contains an image of Ukrainian soldiers. [<image:2750>](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c984g10e22lo)

The Telegraph published an article on August 14, 2024, about Ukraine seizing land in the border region, including a photograph of Ukrainian servicemen near the Russian border. [<image:2751>](https://www.ukrainianphotographers.com/en/news-articles/foreign-mercenaries-in-the-kursk-region)


## Elaboration
The image's geolocation data suggests it was most likely taken in Ukraine or Russia. The image search results provide context, including an article from The Telegraph on August 14, 2024, about Ukraine seizing land in the border region. This aligns with the claim's timeframe of August 2024. The presence of an American flag on the soldiers' uniforms, as seen in the image, supports the claim of American involvement.

However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that the individuals in the image are mercenaries. The Telegraph article mentions Ukrainian servicemen, but it does not specify their nationality. Further information is needed to confirm the claim that the individuals are American mercenaries.

The evidence does not provide information about the incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Newsweek reported on August 16, 2024, about Russia's claims of American soldiers and mercenaries participating in Ukraine's incursion into the Kursk region. [<image:3404>](https://www.newsweek.com/russia-protests-american-soldiers-kursk-1942273) [<image:3401>](https://www.newsweek.com/russia-protests-american-soldiers-kursk-1942273) [<image:3403>](https://www.newsweek.com/russia-protests-american-soldiers-kursk-1942273) The Russian Foreign Ministry protested to the U.S. and claimed to have evidence of American PMC involvement, which the U.S. denied. Anadolu Agency reported on August 20, 2024, that Russia protested the presence of US mercenaries fighting alongside Ukraine in the Kursk region, with the Russian Foreign Ministry claiming US private military companies (PMCs) were fighting alongside Ukrainian troops. [<image:2749>](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/russia-ukraine-war/russia-formally-protests-us-mercenaries-joining-ukrainian-soldiers-in-kursk-region-/3308755) The incursion into the Kursk region began on the night of August 5-6.


## Elaboration
The claim is partially supported by the evidence. Newsweek and Anadolu Agency reported on Russian claims of American mercenaries participating in Ukraine's incursion into the Kursk region in August 2024. The image search results show that the incursion began on the night of August 5-6. The image shows soldiers with American flags on their uniforms, which aligns with the claim. However, the U.S. denied these claims.

On 6 August 2024, the Ukrainian military launched a cross-border incursion into Russia’s Kursk region, which borders Ukraine’s Sumy region. [According](https://www.ohchr.org/en/documents/country-reports/40th-periodic-report-human-rights-situation-ukraine-treatment-prisoners)
 to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), Russian authorities reported that, between 6 and 24 August 2024, the attacks resulted in at least 213 civilian casualties, including 12 deaths.

 that its incursion into Russia’s Kursk region was a defensive military operation conducted in compliance with international humanitarian law (IHL), claiming that it had no “political plans” for the region that “contradict the UN Charter”.

Arria-formula Meeting on Ukraine
================================

Tomorrow morning (5 August), Russia will convene an [Arria-formula meeting](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/un-security-council-working-methods/arria-formula-meetings.php)
 titled “The Armed Forces of Ukraine Military Debacle in the Kursk Region: Preliminary Assessment”. Russian officials also [confirmed](https://www.nbcnews.com/world/ukraine/russia-confirms-north-korean-troops-kursk-rcna203137)
 for the first time in April that the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) had provided support for Russia’s war against Ukraine, including the deployment of troops, after the two countries signed a [mutual defence treaty](https://dprknotes.home.blog/2024/06/20/dprk-russia-treaty-on-comprehensive-strategic-partnership-2024-6-19/)
 in June 2024. On 7 July, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy [said](https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/krok-za-krokom-zakrivayemo-deficit-finansuvannya-na-virobnic-98885)
 that Ukrainian military operations there were still ongoing.

According to the [concept note](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/un-documents/document/arria-formula-meeting-the-armed-forces-of-ukraine-military-debacle-in-the-kursk-region-preliminary-assessment.php)
 prepared by Russia, tomorrow’s meeting is intended to offer member states an opportunity to examine the “political and humanitarian consequences” of Ukraine’s Kursk incursion. The concept note claims that Ukraine’s incursion was assisted by “foreign mercenaries” and involved “severe violations of international law, including the summary execution of civilians, attacks on ambulances and looting”. Russia may reiterate its allegations that Ukrainian soldiers and foreign mercenaries have committed war crimes in its Kursk region. Maxim Grigoriev, a member of the Russian Civic Chamber and Chairman of the International Public Tribunal on Ukraine, which was established by the Russian Civic Chamber in March 2022, is expected to brief. OHCHR has noted that Ukrainian and Russian authorities confirmed that thousands of people had been evacuated on both sides of the border due to escalating hostilities in the area.

In late April, Russian authorities [said](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx26166ngpdo)
 that their forces had regained full control of the Kursk region, a claim that Kyiv has rejected. In January, Ukrainian and US officials [told](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/30/world/europe/north-korea-troops-ukraine-russia.html)
 the New York Times that DPRK troops “have been pulled off the front lines after suffering heavy casualties”, while noting the possibility that they may return in the future after receiving additional training."

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:24> This image shows American mercenaries participating in Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024."

## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:24>)
image_search("American mercenaries Ukraine Russia Kursk Oblast")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Ukraine': 0.69, 'Russia': 0.26, 'Estonia': 0.02, 'Sweden': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0, 'Austria': 0.0, 'Bangladesh': 0.0}

### Evidence from `image_search`
Al Jazeera published an article on March 13, 2025, about Russian forces recapturing Kursk. [<image:2749>](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/13/russian-forces-recapture-kursk-raising-questions-about-us-ukraine-cutoff) The BBC News website contains an image of Ukrainian soldiers. [<image:2750>](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c984g10e22lo)

The Telegraph published an article on August 14, 2024, about Ukraine seizing land in the border region, including a photograph of Ukrainian servicemen near the Russian border. [<image:2751>](https://www.ukrainianphotographers.com/en/news-articles/foreign-mercenaries-in-the-kursk-region)


## Elaboration
The image's geolocation data suggests it was most likely taken in Ukraine or Russia. The image search results provide context, including an article from The Telegraph on August 14, 2024, about Ukraine seizing land in the border region. This aligns with the claim's timeframe of August 2024. The presence of an American flag on the soldiers' uniforms, as seen in the image, supports the claim of American involvement.

However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that the individuals in the image are mercenaries. The Telegraph article mentions Ukrainian servicemen, but it does not specify their nationality. Further information is needed to confirm the claim that the individuals are American mercenaries.

The evidence does not provide information about the incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Newsweek reported on August 16, 2024, about Russia's claims of American soldiers and mercenaries participating in Ukraine's incursion into the Kursk region. [<image:3404>](https://www.newsweek.com/russia-protests-american-soldiers-kursk-1942273) [<image:3401>](https://www.newsweek.com/russia-protests-american-soldiers-kursk-1942273) [<image:3403>](https://www.newsweek.com/russia-protests-american-soldiers-kursk-1942273) The Russian Foreign Ministry protested to the U.S. and claimed to have evidence of American PMC involvement, which the U.S. denied. Anadolu Agency reported on August 20, 2024, that Russia protested the presence of US mercenaries fighting alongside Ukraine in the Kursk region, with the Russian Foreign Ministry claiming US private military companies (PMCs) were fighting alongside Ukrainian troops. [<image:2749>](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/russia-ukraine-war/russia-formally-protests-us-mercenaries-joining-ukrainian-soldiers-in-kursk-region-/3308755) The incursion into the Kursk region began on the night of August 5-6.


## Elaboration
The claim is partially supported by the evidence. Newsweek and Anadolu Agency reported on Russian claims of American mercenaries participating in Ukraine's incursion into the Kursk region in August 2024. The image search results show that the incursion began on the night of August 5-6. The image shows soldiers with American flags on their uniforms, which aligns with the claim. However, the U.S. denied these claims.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2025/08/arria-formula-meeting-on-ukraine-8.php): 
Content: The Security Council Report published on August 4, 2025, discusses an Arria-formula meeting on Ukraine, convened by Russia. The meeting will address the "political and humanitarian consequences" of Ukraine's incursion into the Kursk region, which began on August 6, 2024. Russia claims the incursion involved "foreign mercenaries" and "severe violations of international law." The report mentions that the OHCHR noted at least 213 civilian casualties between August 6 and 24, 2024.


## Elaboration
The claim is supported by the evidence. The Security Council Report confirms the incursion into the Kursk region, which began on August 6, 2024, and involved claims of foreign mercenaries. The image shows soldiers with American flags, which aligns with the claim of American involvement.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that Russia claimed American mercenaries participated in Ukraine's incursion into the Kursk region in August 2024. The image shows soldiers with American flags, supporting the claim. The Security Council Report confirms the incursion and mentions claims of foreign mercenaries.

`true`

## Summary

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA) published an article about the second battle of Kursk, including an image of a tank (<image:6630>). Al Jazeera published an article on August 16, 2024, about Russia eliminating a Ukrainian unit, also including an image of a tank (<image:6631>). NBC News published an article about the evacuation of Belgorod and Kursk, which also contains an image of a tank (<image:6632>).

The provided sources do not contain the image of destroyed Ukrainian tanks (<image:26>).


### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Pakistan': 0.08, 'Turkey': 0.08, 'Bhutan': 0.06, 'Jordan': 0.06, 'Ukraine': 0.06, 'Kyrgyzstan': 0.05, 'Palestine': 0.05, 'Russia': 0.05, 'Colombia': 0.04, 'Montenegro': 0.04}

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image search did not find the image in question. The geolocation search suggests that the image could have been taken in Russia, but the probability is low.

The claim cannot be verified due to the lack of evidence. More information is needed to confirm the image's origin and the context of the destroyed tanks.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

He also assessed that [earlier raids into Kursk and Belgorod](/wiki/March_2024_western_Russia_incursion "March 2024 western Russia incursion")
 were designed to probe for Russian weak spots, and that the overall goal of the raid is to dismantle Russia's ability to funnel more troops into the [Kharkiv front](/wiki/2024_Kharkiv_offensive "2024 Kharkiv offensive")
 and that "It's unlikely that the plan is to seriously take Kursk itself, or to try and hold vast swathes of Russian territory."[\[79\]](#cite_note-Politico_August_8-81)

Revealed: Russia anticipated Kursk incursion months in advance, seized papers show
==================================================================================

This article is more than 11 months old

**Exclusive:** Documents contain months of warnings about possible Ukrainian advance and also reveal concerns about morale

Russia’s military command had anticipated Ukraine’s incursion into its Kursk region and had been making plans to prevent it for several months, according to a cache of documents that the Ukrainian army said it had seized from abandoned Russian positions in the region.

The disclosure makes the disarray among Russian forces after Ukraine’s attack in early August all the more embarrassing. The earliest entries are dated late in 2023, while the most recent documents are from just six weeks before Ukraine launched its incursion into the Kursk region on 6 August.

The documents mostly come from units of Russia’s 488th Guards Motorised Rifle Regiment, and in particular the second company of its 17th Battalion.

Ukraine’s incursion into Kursk took Kyiv’s western partners and many in the Ukrainian elite by surprise, as planning had been restricted to a very small number of people. But Russian military documents contain months of warnings about a possible incursion into the area and an attempt to occupy Sudzha, a town of 5,000 residents that has now been [under Ukrainian occupation](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/07/ukraine-sudzha-russian-town-kursk-region)
 for more than a month.

An entry from 4 January spoke of the “potential for a breakthrough at the state border” by Ukrainian armed groups and ordered increased training to prepare to repel any attack. It recounts an incident that reportedly took place on 20 January this year, when a conscript soldier entered the summer washing area at a guard post and shot himself in the abdomen.

“The investigation into the incident determined that the cause of the suicide and death was a nervous and psychological breakdown, caused by his prolonged state of depression due to his service in the Russian army,” reads the handwritten report of the incident.

To prevent further such incidents, unit commanders are instructed to identify soldiers who “are mentally unprepared to fulfil their duties or prone to deviant behaviour, and organise their reassignment and transfer to military medical facilities”.

Further instructions on keeping up morale come in an undated, typed document that explains that soldiers should get 5-10 minutes a day as well as an hour once a week of political instruction, “aimed at maintaining and raising the political, moral and psychological condition of the personnel”.

A Ukrainian armoured personnel carrier in the Sumy region, near the border with Russia’s Kursk region, on 17 August. On 19 February, unit commanders were warned of Ukrainian plans for “a rapid push from the Sumy region into Russian territory, up to a depth of 80km \[50 miles\], to establish a four-day ‘corridor’ ahead of the arrival of the main Ukrainian army units on armoured vehicles”.

In mid-March, units at the border were ordered to boost defensive lines and “organise additional exercises for the leadership of units and strongpoints regarding the proper organisation of defences” in preparation for a Ukrainian cross-border attack.

In mid-June, there was a more specific warning of Ukrainian plans “in the direction Yunakivka-Sudzha, with the goal of taking Sudzha under control”, which did indeed happen in August. The June document complained that Russian units stationed at the front “are filled only 60-70% on average, and primarily made up of reserves with weak training”.

When the Ukrainian attack came on 6 August, many Russian soldiers abandoned their positions, and within a week Ukraine had taken full control of Sudzha. The parents of one conscript soldier from the second company, featured in the documents, recorded a [tearful video appeal](https://t.me/mobilizationnews/19909)
 in August, identifying him as their 22-year-old son Vadim Kopylov, saying he had been taken prisoner near Sudzha and calling on Russian authorities to exchange him.

The documents give an insight into Russian tactics over the past year, in one case speaking of the need to create decoy trenches and positions to confuse Ukrainian reconnaissance drones."

No effect on the Pokrovsk front
-------------------------------

There was also increasing evidence that Moscow was having trouble stopping the Ukrainian counterinvasion in Kursk and was increasingly tapping elite units to do so.

Russian military reporters and geolocated footage have revealed that elements of the 810th and 155th naval infantry brigades, the 11th Airborne Brigade, and the 51st and 56th airborne regiments were redeployed to fight in Kursk.

The 810th and 155th naval infantry brigades had been fighting in Kharkiv, where Russia launched a new incursion in May. Sarantsev admitted that the Kursk action had had no effect on the Pokrovsk front.

Published On 29 Aug 202429 Aug 2024

Ukraine’s deep strikes against Russian military targets and its three-week-old ground offensive inside Russian territory have appeared to be yielding military and political results during the past week.

Russia was reported to be moving its aircraft back from airfields near the Ukrainian border while glide bomb attacks inside Ukraine were reported to have decreased. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy last week said it was a preemptive defence to prevent another Kharkiv-type invasion in the north.

But he also told Ukrainians it was “a way to compensate for the deficit in long-range capabilities”.

For months, Zelenskyy has implored the United States to allow Ukraine to use the [ATACMS long-range rocket artillery](/news/2024/8/23/which-countries-weapons-is-ukraine-using-in-russia-incursion)
 it provides to strike airfields deep inside Russia. He also wants the US to release Britain and France, for whose Storm Shadow missiles the US provides components, to authorise their use in the same way.

Currently, the US allows Ukraine to use its weapons to counter battery fire within a limited range across the border but not to hit Russian airfields because it is afraid that this could draw the US into the war.

![INTERACTIVE-WHO CONTROLS WHAT IN SOUTHERN UKRAINE-1724833604](/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/INTERACTIVE-WHO-CONTROLS-WHAT-IN-SOUTHERN-UKRAINE-1724833604.png?w=770&resize=770%2C770&quality=80)

(Al Jazeera)

In a recent analysis, the ISW identified that “at least 209 of 245 (more than 85 percent) known Russian military objects in range of ATACMS are not air bases” but ammunition depots, communications centres, army bases and command centres.

White House national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters on Monday that restrictions on the use of long-range weapons remain in place but “we’ll keep the conversations with the Ukrainians going” to potentially revise them.

The European Commission, which does not command military assets, has openly supported a lifting of restrictions.

The European Union’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, [repeated that support](/news/2024/8/29/eus-borrell-urges-ukraine-backers-to-lift-curbs-on-arms-use-inside-russia)
 on Monday and Thursday. He also wants to bind EU allies closer in a joint air defence, a defensive measure that wouldn’t provoke Russia, he said, and has already been implemented in protecting Israel from a massive Iranian missile and drone attack on [April 13-14](/news/2024/4/14/iran-attacks-israel-with-over-300-drones-missiles-what-you-need-to-know)
.

After Russia fired 127 missiles and launched 109 Shahed drones into Ukraine on Monday, one of its largest ever aerial attacks targeting energy and civilian infrastructure, Zelenskyy said: “We must finally come to the joint shooting-down of Russian missiles and drones. Life has the same value everywhere.”

Zelenskyy said he had discussed such a joint aerial defence with Lithuanian Prime Minister Ingrid Shimonite and Polish President Andrej Duda in Kyiv on August 24.

Taking the fight to Russia
--------------------------

While Ukraine seeks expanded authority and cooperation from its allies, it is also going its own way. It is believed prototypes of this missile may have been used against Russian-occupied Crimea in August 2023 to [destroy two S-400](/news/2024/2/12/for-ukraines-defence-industry-ambitions-the-skys-the-limit)
 air defence systems. Evidence that Moscow was scrambling elite units from Ukraine to defend home turf also mounted during the week.

An unnamed White House official told the Politico news website that “90 percent of the planes that launch glide bombs” against Ukrainian front-line positions had been moved back inside Russia.

![INTERACTIVE-ATTACK_ON_KURSK_AUG_28-1724833592](/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/INTERACTIVE-ATTACK_ON_KURSK_AUG_20-1724833592.png?w=770&resize=770%2C962&quality=80)

(Al Jazeera)

The independent analysis website Frontelligence agreed that “between the second half of June and mid-July, Russian forces relocated many valuable assets away from the Ukrainian border,” including planes and helicopters.

Ukrainian Colonel Vitaly Sarantsev told a joint news telethon broadcast by Ukrainian channels that the Kursk offensive had greatly reduced Russia’s use of aviation against northeastern Ukraine.

“We felt relief in tactical aviation,” he said on Sunday. If so, that would be a significant proportion of the more than 700,000 soldiers Russia is estimated to have in Ukraine.

The Washington, DC-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a think tank, estimated that Russia would need 60,000 soldiers to win back territory in Kursk once Ukrainian defences were dug."

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:26> This image shows destroyed Ukrainian tanks during Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024."

## Actions
```
image_search("destroyed Ukrainian tanks Kursk Oblast August 2024")
geolocate(<image:26>)
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA) published an article about the second battle of Kursk, including an image of a tank (<image:6630>). Al Jazeera published an article on August 16, 2024, about Russia eliminating a Ukrainian unit, also including an image of a tank (<image:6631>). NBC News published an article about the evacuation of Belgorod and Kursk, which also contains an image of a tank (<image:6632>).

The provided sources do not contain the image of destroyed Ukrainian tanks (<image:26>).


### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Pakistan': 0.08, 'Turkey': 0.08, 'Bhutan': 0.06, 'Jordan': 0.06, 'Ukraine': 0.06, 'Kyrgyzstan': 0.05, 'Palestine': 0.05, 'Russia': 0.05, 'Colombia': 0.04, 'Montenegro': 0.04}

## Elaboration
The image search did not find the image in question. The geolocation search suggests that the image could have been taken in Russia, but the probability is low.

The claim cannot be verified due to the lack of evidence. More information is needed to confirm the image's origin and the context of the destroyed tanks.


## Actions
```
web_search("Ukraine incursion into Russia Kursk Oblast August 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results discuss the Ukrainian incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024. One Wikipedia article details the incursion, mentioning the involvement of Ukrainian, Russian, and North Korean forces, the capture of settlements, and the use of tanks and armored vehicles. The Guardian published an article on September 20, 2024, discussing Russia's anticipation of the incursion. Al Jazeera also covered the incursion, mentioning the cross-border incursion of Ukrainian troops on August 7, 2024. The articles include images of tanks and armored vehicles (<image:6630>

## Elaboration
The web search confirms that there was a Ukrainian incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024, as the claim states. The search results mention the use of tanks and armored vehicles during the incursion.

However, the search results do not include the image of destroyed Ukrainian tanks. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified. More evidence is needed to confirm that the image depicts destroyed Ukrainian tanks during the specified incursion.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The fact-check reveals that there was indeed a Ukrainian incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024, as the claim states. However, the image search and web search did not find the image of destroyed tanks in the context of the incursion. The geolocation search suggests the image could have been taken in Russia, but the probability is low.

Therefore, the claim is not fully verifiable due to the lack of evidence directly linking the image to the specified event. `not enough information`
