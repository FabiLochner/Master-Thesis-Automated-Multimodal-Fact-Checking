### Evidence from `web_search`
According to a Yahoo News article published on May 29, 2024, Alex Jones speculated that the killing of Jamie White, an Infowars writer, in Austin, Texas, "couldâ€™ve been a hit" orchestrated by Ukraine. The Latin Times reported that White was found dead in a parking lot in Austin, Texas, and that Alex Jones alleged White was murdered by Ukrainian forces and was on a Ukrainian hit list. The "Investigate Earth Conspiracy Podcast" also discusses the murder of Jamie White, and suggests that White may have been on a Ukrainian NGO hit list.

The Latin Times article was published in 2025.


## Elaboration
The claim that Jamie White was on a Ukrainian hit list cannot be verified. While multiple sources confirm that Jamie White, an InfoWars writer, was shot in Austin, Texas, on March 9 or 10, 2025, none of the provided evidence supports the assertion that he was on a Ukrainian hit list. However, Alex Jones speculated that the killing could have been a hit orchestrated by Ukraine.


## Final Judgement
The claim that Jamie White was on a Ukrainian hit list is not supported by the evidence. While the shooting of Jamie White is confirmed by multiple sources, there is no evidence to support the claim that he was on a Ukrainian hit list. The only mention of this is speculation by Alex Jones.
