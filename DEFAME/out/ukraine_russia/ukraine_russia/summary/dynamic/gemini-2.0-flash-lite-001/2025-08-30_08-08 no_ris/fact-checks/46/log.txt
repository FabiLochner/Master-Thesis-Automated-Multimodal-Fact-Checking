The claim 'During his visit to the White House in April 2025 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced plans to resettle Palestinians in Gaza to Ukraine and Syria.' is false.
Justification: The claim is demonstrably false. While Benjamin Netanyahu did meet with President Trump at the White House in April 2025, as reported by [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-netanyahu-meeting-dc-israel-hamas-war-gaza-ceasefire/), he did not announce plans to resettle Palestinians in Gaza to Ukraine and Syria. According to [StopFake.org](https://www.stopfake.org/en/fake-israeli-prime-minister-netanyahu-proposed-to-resettle-gaza-residents-to-ukraine-and-syria/), the claim is a misinterpretation of his statements.
