Useful result: From [Source](https://www.russiamatters.org/blog/russias-economy-collapsing): 
Content: The search result from Russia Matters, published on February 6, 2025, states that the IMF ranks Russia as the worldâ€™s 4th largest economy in terms of PPP. <image:AP24325279743092>

The claim 'In October 2024 the International Monetary Fund (IMF) declared Russia the fourth-largest economy in the world.' is false.
Justification: The IMF did rank Russia as the world's fourth-largest economy in terms of Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), according to a Russia Matters article published on February 6, 2025, as stated in the [source](https://www.russiamatters.org/blog/russias-economy-collapsing). However, the claim specifies October 2024, and the provided source is from February 2025, so the exact date of the IMF's ranking is not confirmed by the evidence.

So, the overall veracity is: false
