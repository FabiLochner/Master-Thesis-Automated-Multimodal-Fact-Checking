The claim '<image:12> This image shows a chemical attack by the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the Kursk offensive in August 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not verifiable. While the image search and geolocation provide some context, they do not confirm the claim about a chemical attack by the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the Kursk offensive in August 2024. The Reuters report ([https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-says-russia-tries-accuse-it-false-war-crimes-kursk-2024-08-12/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-says-russia-tries-accuse-it-false-war-crimes-kursk-2024-08-12/)) indicates that the claim of a chemical attack was made by Russia and could not be independently verified.

So, the overall veracity is: false
