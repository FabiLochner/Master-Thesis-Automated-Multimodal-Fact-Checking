Useful result: From [Source](https://disinfo.detector.media/en/post/blackrock-allegedly-owns-47-of-ukraines-territory-and-has-banned-ukraine-from-burying-its-military): 
Content: Detector Media states that propagandists falsely claim BlackRock owns 47% of Ukraine's territory and asked not to bury soldiers on its land. The press service of the President of Ukraine reported a meeting between Volodymyr Zelenskyi and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink in late 2022 to discuss recovery funds. In 2023, Ukraine signed an agreement with BlackRock and JPMorgan to create a fund for attracting private investment, but this did not include restrictions on burying the military.

The claim 'BlackRock has asked that Ukrainian soldiers not be buried on the land it owns in Ukraine.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. According to the Asia Fact Check Lab ([source](https://www.example.com/)), the claim originated from a Bulgarian politician and was shared by Russian and Chinese media. BlackRock does not own land in Ukraine, and foreign companies are prohibited from purchasing arable land under Ukrainian law. Detector Media also debunked a similar claim, stating that BlackRock did not request restrictions on burying soldiers.

So, the overall veracity is: false
