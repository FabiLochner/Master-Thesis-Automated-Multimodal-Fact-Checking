Useful result: From [Source](https://www.csis.org/analysis/russias-battlefield-woes-ukraine): 
Content: The search result from CSIS mentions that Russia has suffered extraordinary fatalities and casualties in the Ukraine war.

The article also mentions an event titled "One Million Casualties: Russiaâ€™s Losses on the Battlefield" on June 13, 2025. <image:3635>, <image:3636>.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/ukraine-says-russias-military-losses-have-topped-1-million-in-3-years-of-war): 
Content: PBS News reports that according to Ukrainian military officials, the number of Russian troops killed or wounded in Ukraine has topped 1 million. The article is dated June 12, 2025. <image:3639>

The claim 'As of February 2025, Russia has lost 1.5 million troops in the Ukraine war.' is false.
Justification: The claim is plausible but not definitively confirmed. While a British Army official estimated 1.5 to 1.8 million casualties, and PBS News reported that Russian losses topped 1 million by June 2025 ([https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/ukraine-says-russias-military-losses-have-topped-1-million-in-3-years-of-war](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/ukraine-says-russias-military-losses-have-topped-1-million-in-3-years-of-war)), the exact figure for February 2025 is not explicitly stated.

So, the overall veracity is: false
