The claim 'In a press conference on December 9, 2024 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said: 'I will ask Biden to invite me to NATO ... there's no point in talking to Trump.'' is false.
Justification: On December 9, 2024, Zelenskyy discussed NATO membership with Biden, as reported by The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/dec/09/russia-ukraine-war-live-donald-trump-ceasefire-call-volodymyr-zelenskyy](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/dec/09/russia-ukraine-war-live-donald-trump-ceasefire-call-volodymyr-zelenskyy)). However, the provided sources do not contain the exact quote from the claim, and the statement about not talking to Trump is not directly supported by the evidence.

So, the overall veracity is: false
