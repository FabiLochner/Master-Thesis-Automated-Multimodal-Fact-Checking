## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
In February 2025, articles from Al Jazeera ([Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/2/21/musk-vows-to-fix-x-after-polls-show-high-support-for-ukraines-zelenskyy)) and CNBC ([Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/21/elon-musk-has-problem-with-x-community-notes-after-ukraine-corrections.html)) reported on Elon Musk's criticism of X's "Community Notes" feature and his concerns about the credibility of polling data related to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Musk stated he would "fix" the feature, claiming it was being manipulated, but did not provide evidence.

Al Jazeera ([Source](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/musk-vows-to-fix-x-after-polls-show-high-support-for-ukraines-zelensky/)) also reported that Musk shared an unsubstantiated claim about Zelenskyy's approval rating. <image:k> <image:k>
