## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
In October 2024, the IMF published the World Economic Outlook, which included global growth projections and a database with data (![image 4533](media/2025-08-23_11-53-1755950009-342605.jpg)). The IMF also held a meeting in Washington, D.C. on October 24-25, 2024. According to the Minister of Finance of the Russian Federation, Anton Siluanov, the Russian economy has shown high growth rates, surpassing most forecasts, including those of the IMF.

The Moscow Times reported on October 22, 2024, that the IMF boosted its 2024 growth forecast for Russia (![image 4535](media/2025-08-23_11-54-1755950056-339449.jpg)). The IMF expects the Russian economy to expand by 3.6% in 2024.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the IMF published the World Economic Outlook in October 2024, which included global growth projections. The IMF also boosted its 2024 growth forecast for Russia. However, the provided evidence does not explicitly state that the IMF declared Russia the fourth-largest economy in the world.

To verify the claim, I would need to consult the World Economic Outlook or other IMF publications from October 2024 to see if they contain a ranking of the world's largest economies.

## Final Judgement
The IMF did rank Russia as the fourth-largest economy in the world in terms of PPP, according to a Russia Matters article. However, the claim specifies October 2024, and the provided source is from February 2025. While the information is likely accurate, the exact date of the IMF's ranking is not confirmed by the provided evidence.
