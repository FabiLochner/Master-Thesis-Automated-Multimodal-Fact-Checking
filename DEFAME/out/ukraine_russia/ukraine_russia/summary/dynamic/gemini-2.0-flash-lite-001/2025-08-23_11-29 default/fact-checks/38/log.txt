The claim 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy engaged in election interference by campaigning in Pennsylvania for Kamala Harris ahead of the US presidential election in 2024.' is false.
Justification: Based on reports from sources like Newsweek and U.S. News & World Report, Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited Pennsylvania and met with Kamala Harris before the 2024 US presidential election. While Republicans, including JD Vance and Donald Trump, accused Zelenskyy of campaigning for Democrats, and Le Monde suggested his actions signaled involvement in the election, there is no direct evidence of explicit campaigning for Kamala Harris. Therefore, the claim is considered false.

So, the overall veracity is: false
