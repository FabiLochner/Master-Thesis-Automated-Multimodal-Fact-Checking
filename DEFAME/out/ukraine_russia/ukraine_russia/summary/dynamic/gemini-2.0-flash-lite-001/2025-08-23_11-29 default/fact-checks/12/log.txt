Useful result: From [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/2/european-leaders-gather-in-london-to-strengthen-support-for-ukraine): 
Content: Al Jazeera published an article about the London Summit on Ukraine on March 2, 2025. The article includes a photograph of European leaders at the summit. <image:4134>

The claim '<image:9> This is an authentic image of world leaders taking off their suits to symbolically support Ukraine at the London summit on Ukraine on March 2, 2025.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While the London Summit on Ukraine did take place on March 2, 2025, images from the summit, as shown in sources like Reuters and Al Jazeera, depict the leaders wearing suits, not removing them as the claim suggests.

So, the overall veracity is: false
