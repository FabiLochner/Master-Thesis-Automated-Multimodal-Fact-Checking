## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
According to POLITICO, Olaf Scholz was unaware of Donald Trump's peace plan for Ukraine. The article also mentions Germany's role in supplying aid to Kyiv and its military support for Ukraine, published before the Feb. 23 parliamentary election. ([https://www.politico.eu/article/olaf-scholz-germany-donald-trump-war-in-ukraine-peace-plan/](https://www.politico.eu/article/olaf-scholz-germany-donald-trump-war-in-ukraine-peace-plan/))

Euronews fact-checked a claim that Scholz declared a state of emergency, stating that he did not, but instead referred to "Notlage." ([https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/02/19/fact-check-scholz-did-not-call-for-german-state-of-emergency-over-russia-us-peace-talks](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/02/19/fact-check-scholz-did-not-call-for-german-state-of-emergency-over-russia-us-peace-talks)) FRANCE 24 reported on European leaders' reactions to Trump's negotiations with Putin, with Scholz warning against a "dictated peace."

### Evidence from `web_search`
In February 2025, an NPR article reported that German Chancellor Olaf Scholz criticized U.S. Vice President JD Vance. The article, published on February 15, 2025, does not mention a state of emergency or Donald Trump's peace plan for Ukraine.  The 2025 German federal election was held on February 23, 2025, and Donald Trump congratulated the election winners.

Reuters published an article on February 20, 2025, where Olaf Scholz discussed Ukraine's EU membership and rejected the idea that Ukraine was to blame for the war. The article mentions that Europe is scrambling to find a response to Trump's policy on the war.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the claim is false. Euronews fact-checked a similar claim and found that Scholz did not declare a state of emergency. Furthermore, the provided sources show that Scholz was aware of Trump's potential peace plan and reacted to it, but there is no mention of a state of emergency.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that Olaf Scholz did not declare a state of emergency in February 2025. While he was aware of Trump's potential peace plan, there is no evidence to support the claim that he declared a state of emergency due to it.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. Fact-checks from Euronews ([https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/02/19/fact-check-scholz-did-not-call-for-german-state-of-emergency-over-russia-us-peace-talks](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/02/19/fact-check-scholz-did-not-call-for-german-state-of-emergency-over-russia-us-peace-talks)) and other sources confirm that Scholz did not declare a state of emergency. While Scholz was aware of Trump's peace plan, there is no evidence to support the claim that he declared a state of emergency in response to it.
