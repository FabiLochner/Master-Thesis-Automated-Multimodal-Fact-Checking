## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Pro-Kremlin social media accounts spread a false narrative that mansions belonging to Ukrainian military officials burned down in the Los Angeles wildfires in January 2025. This claim was debunked by fact-checkers from Greece and the United States, and the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council's Center for Countering Disinformation described it as "Russian propaganda." The story originated on a pro-Russian Telegram channel and was initially presented as satire, but later reposts omitted this context. There is no evidence to support the claim, and Valerii Zaluzhnyi, a former Ukrainian general, was falsely named as one of the individuals who supposedly lost their homes (![image 2342](media/2025-08-07_20-30-1754598640-955496.jpg)).

Forbes ([https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2025/01/13/satire-or-disinformation-ukrainian-generals-lost-homes-in-la-fires/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2025/01/13/satire-or-disinformation-ukrainian-generals-lost-homes-in-la-fires/)) also covered the claim (![image 2335](media/2025-08-07_20-30-1754598606-937437.jpg)).


## Elaboration
The claim is false. The evidence indicates that the claim originated from pro-Russian sources and was debunked by fact-checkers. The Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council's Center for Countering Disinformation labeled it as Russian propaganda.


## Final Judgement
The claim is demonstrably false. Multiple reliable sources, including NPR, Houston Public Media, and Forbes, have debunked the claim, identifying it as disinformation originating from pro-Russian sources. There is no evidence to support the claim that mansions belonging to Ukrainian military officials burned down in the Los Angeles wildfires.
