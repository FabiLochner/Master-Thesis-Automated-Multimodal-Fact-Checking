## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
CNN reports that Ukrainian forces captured Sudzha in the Kursk region on August 15, 2024, and that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed the capture of Sudzha ([https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/15/europe/kursk-incursion-sudzha-captured-ukraine-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/15/europe/kursk-incursion-sudzha-captured-ukraine-intl)). Meduza published an article on March 17, 2025, analyzing Russiaâ€™s Kursk counteroffensive and the implications of losing Sudzha for Ukraine ([https://meduza.io/en/feature/2025/03/17/a-costly-gamble](https://meduza.io/en/feature/2025/03/17/a-costly-gamble)).

The Kyiv Independent published an article on March 12, 2025, discussing the situation in Kursk Oblast, including Sudzha, and mentions a cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024. The article includes a photo of Zelensky (![image 7](media/9.jpg)).


### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image ![image 7](media/9.jpg)

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the claim is likely false. While the evidence confirms that Ukrainian forces captured Sudzha in the Kursk region in August 2024, and that Zelensky was present in the area, it does not confirm that the image depicts Zelensky arriving in Sudzha or meeting with representatives of the people there. The Kyiv Independent article includes the image, but does not specify the context of the photo.

The evidence does not provide enough information to verify the claim that the image shows Zelensky arriving in Sudzha and meeting with representatives. More information is needed to confirm the context of the image.


## Final Judgement
The search results confirm that Ukrainian forces captured Sudzha in the Kursk region in August 2024, and that Zelensky was present in the area. However, the evidence does not confirm that the image depicts Zelensky arriving in Sudzha or meeting with representatives of the people there.

The claim is not factually accurate because the context of the image is not confirmed. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is not supported by the evidence. While the search results confirm that Ukrainian forces captured Sudzha in the Kursk region in August 2024, and that Zelensky was present in the area, the context of the image is not confirmed. The evidence does not verify that the image depicts Zelensky arriving in Sudzha or meeting with representatives of the people there.
