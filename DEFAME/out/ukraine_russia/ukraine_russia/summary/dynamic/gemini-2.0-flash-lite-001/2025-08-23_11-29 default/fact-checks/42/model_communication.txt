“They may have their own relations, but talking about Ukraine without us — it is dangerous for everyone,” Zelenskyy said.

He said his team has been in contact with the Trump administration, but those discussions are at a “general level,” and he believes in-person meetings will take place soon to develop more detailed agreements.

“We need to work more on this,” he said, adding that Trump understandably appeared to be focused on domestic issues in the first weeks after his inauguration.

The nearly three-year war in Ukraine is at a crossroads. But a planned visit by [Trump’s Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg](https://apnews.com/article/trump-transition-ukraine-russia-war-kellogg-68b413ecde625f6643aebe5759a752e7)

, a longstanding wish for Kyiv that Moscow has categorically rejected, is still Zelenskyy’s top choice.

NATO membership is the “cheapest” option for Ukraine’s allies, and it would also strengthen Trump geopolitically, Zelenskyy argued.

“I really believe that these are the cheapest security guarantees that Ukraine can get, the cheapest for everyone,” he said.

“It will be a signal that it is not for Russia to decide who should be in NATO and who should not, but for the United States of America to decide."

Zelenskyy said his team has been in contact with the Trump administration, but those discussions are at a “general level,” and he believes in-person meetings will take place soon to develop more detailed agreements.

A planned visit by Trump’s envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellog was postponed. Zelenskyy said Putin interprets negotiating directly with Kyiv as losing.

He said Trump could bring Putin to the table through the threat of sanctions targeting Russia’s energy and banking system, as well as continued support of the Ukrainian military.

NATO is the 'cheapest' security guarantee option

Zelenskyy said NATO membership is the “cheapest” option for Ukraine's allies, and it would strengthen Trump geopolitically.

Other scenarios that involve arming and training Ukraine’s 800,000-strong army would be expensive for U.S. troops.

Approving Ukraine’s NATO bid would be “a great victory” for Trump, Zelenskyy added, in an apparent appeal to the president’s penchant for winners and business deals.

Skepticism about putting European troops in Ukraine

Zelenskyy said a French proposal to put European forces in Ukraine as a deterrent force is taking shape, but he expressed skepticism, saying many questions remained about the command-and-control structure and the number of troops and their positions.

Zelenskyy said he told both French President Emmanuel Marcon and Trump that the option of putting European troops in Ukraine was welcome, but it would not be a sufficient security guarantee alone.

He added: “Imagine, there is a contingent. (AP Photo/Eric Gay)](https://www.usnews.com/object/image/00000197-b27c-d052-a3ff-b27dd7c50000/june-27-pyss-w03.jpg?update-time=1751046429007&size=responsive640)

Their work has reinforced AP’s influence as a go-to news outlet for Zelenskyy’s most critical interviews.

Best of AP — Second Winner

AP Interview: Zelenskyy says excluding Ukraine from U.S.-Russia talks about war is ‘very dangerous’
===================================================================================================

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy gestures as he speaks during an interview with The Associated Press in Kyiv, Ukraine, Saturday, Feb. While the Kyiv team has tirelessly lobbied the Ukrainian government for access and interviews throughout the country’s nearly three-year conflict with Russia—and secured previous sit-downs with Zelenskyy—this was the first time his office approached AP to propose an interview.

With just hours to prepare, the entire team sprang into action. Reporter Illia Novikov provided live, simultaneous translation, longtime photographer Efrem Lukatsky captured images, and Yurchuk produced the video.

The result: an hourlong interview in which Zelenskyy warned that excluding Ukraine from U.S.-Russia war talks is “very dangerous,” called for Kyiv and Washington to develop a ceasefire plan, and outlined his latest thinking on security guarantees needed for a peace deal and NATO membership.

The judges were impressed by the team’s ability to move quickly and deliver such a polished and impactful interview under intense time constraints. 1, 2025\

Inspector General Robert P. The DoD OIG audit revealed that the DoD did not provide sufficient documentation to support the justification or accuracy of half that total—$1.1 billion. 

As a result, the DoD lacks assurance that $1.1 billion of Ukraine supplemental funds were used as intended, and the DoD OIG considers them questioned costs because, at the time of the audit, the purpose and the accuracy of the costs were not supported by adequate documentation. Without sufficient documentation to justify and verify these payments, the DoD cannot provide assurance or transparency to the public, DoD leadership, or Congress regarding using the Ukraine assistance funds. Additionally, if the DoD does not implement the recommendations in this report, the control issues identified could also apply to the more than $76 billion of additional Ukraine supplemental funding appropriated after 2022.

The DoD OIG made five recommendations to DoD management, including that the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller)/Chief Financial Officer, in coordination with the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, develop and implement guidance that requires DoD Components to document the justification of payments that use supplemental funding appropriated for a specific purpose.

**Official websites use .mil**

A **.mil** website belongs to an official U.S. Department of Defense organization in the United States.

**Secure .mil websites use HTTPS**

A **lock (lock )** or **https://** means you’ve safely connected to the .mil website. The audit also identified that the DoD Financial Management Regulation did not require DoD Components to document the justification of payments that use supplemental funds for a specific purpose, such as documentation supporting the use of the Disaster Emergency Fund Code value. The DoD OIG also recommended a review of the supporting documentation for the questioned costs to determine whether the payments were accurate and supported the Ukraine assistance mission. 

The DoD OIG will continue to monitor the DoD’s implementation of the recommendations in this report.

Content: "<image:3835>](https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Claim%20-%20Fact%20US%20Ukraine%20Support%202.0_0.png)

**US aid to Ukraine does not lack oversight nor has corruption in Ukraine diverted it.**

Claim: _US aid to Ukraine lacks oversight and is being misused because of corruption in Ukraine._

Fact: US oversight is extensive, and Ukrainian government oversight and accountability is extensive and growing.

*   Critics point to a recent corruption case in which a small Ukrainian defense enterprise embezzled $40 million from public ammunition procurement funds, **without noting that the Ukrainian government caught the thieves and recovered the money.****\[1\]**
*   Ukraine has undertaken significant anti-corruption efforts within its government and defense industrial base enterprises as part of efforts to increase domestic defense production.\[2\]
*   President Zelensky fired the previous defense minister after domestic corruption scandals unrelated to Western assistance emerged, and his replacement, the current minister, is aggressively rooting out corruption.\[3\] The Ukrainian government is also leveraging the robust and expansive Ukrainian NGO community to assist with its anti-corruption efforts.
*   Ukrainian and DoD personnel have been working aggressively to continue to improve monitoring and tracking of US aid, and US DoD officials have stated that there is no evidence that US-provided military assistance to Ukraine has been misappropriated.\[4\]
*   84% of the funds for Ukraine in the current proposed package would go to US companies, the US military, and other allied militaries, not Ukraine, which would get hardware and training from those funds.\[5\]
*   Western-provided weapons are being used as intended.  Mountains of evidence show advanced Western systems being used against Russian forces in Ukraine.\[6\]

**America’s NATO and Asian allies and other European states have committed more money to support Ukraine than the United States.**

Claim: _The United States is giving more support to Ukraine than Europe, and Europe hasn’t stepped up._

Fact: America’s European, Asian, and NATO allies have committed over $178 billion to support Ukraine, which is more than the US will have committed counting the aid package currently under consideration.

*   The EU and its member states have made available $148.5 billion (138 billion euros) - including its recently announced support package of $54 billion (50 billion euros) - to Ukraine since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022.\[7\]
*   The United Kingdom has pledged $15.1 billion (£12 billion) in overall support to Ukraine since February 2022, of which $9 billion (£7.1 billion) is for military assistance.\[8\]
*   Canada has committed $1.8 billion (over 2.4 billion Canadian dollars) in military assistance to Ukraine since February 2022.\[9\] The Canadian military has also has trained approximately 40,000 Ukrainian military and security personnel since 2015, and Canada expanded and extended this program until March 2026.
*   Norway reached a multi-year agreement with Ukraine in February 2023 for a support program that will provide Ukraine with $7 billion (75 billion Norwegian kroner) between 2023 and 2027.\[10\] Norway pledged to allocate to Ukraine around $1.4 billion (15 billion Norwegian kroner) per year and had already provided around one billion dollars (10.7 billion Norwegian kroner) to Ukraine in 2022 and about $1.9 billion (19.9 billion Norwegian kroner) in 2023.
*   NATO member Turkey is building a new drone production facility and service center in Ukraine. Turkey’s leading drone maker, Baykar, announced in September 2023 that Turkey would open a drone production facility and service center for Bayraktar TB2 drones, which reportedly will become operational by early 2025.\[11\]
*   NATO member North Macedonia has sent 10 batches of military aid to Ukraine including Soviet-era military equipment as of November 2023.\[12\] North Macedonia is also training batches of Ukrainian military personnel and pledged to continue supporting Ukraine.\[13\]
*   South Korea is expanding its production of critical 155mm artillery shells to refill Western stockpiles and support the continued provision of ammunition in Ukraine.\[14\]
*   Japan pledged $4.5 billion to Ukraine in December 2023.\[15\] Japan also pledged an additional $37 million contribution to a NATO fund to provide additional support for Ukrainian defense in January 2024.\[16\]
*   Australia provided approximately $590 million (910 million Australian dollars) in overall military and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine as of late October 2023.\[17\]
*   New Zealand provided Ukraine with more than $48.7 million (80 million New Zealand dollars) in military and humanitarian assistance as of July 2023.\[18\]

**Ukraine is not a “forever war” for the United States because Americans are not fighting this war.**

Claim: _Ukraine is another 'forever war' for the United States._

Fact: This is not an American war.  It’s another nation’s war against an American enemy.

*   Ukrainians are fighting this war, not Americans.
*   The US is helping Ukraine fend off the Russian attack to reduce the risk that the US will have to fight Russia in the future. 
*   A Putin victory over Ukraine would embolden him and encourage him to test America’s willingness to defend its NATO allies, increasing the risk of a US-Russia war.\[19\]
*   Russian victory would also let Russian forces move closer to current NATO borders, forcing the US to commit more troops to the defense of its NATO allies.\[20\]
*   Ukraine is building up its own military and defense industry to be able to reduce its dependence on the US and will be able to do so if the US continues its support.\[21\]
*   Ukraine already has a significant defense industry and was one of the world’s leading weapons suppliers before the Russian invasions and is investing its own money and attracting foreign investors to dramatically increase this capability.\[22\]

**Sending military aid to Ukraine increases America’s military readiness and reduces the risk that the United States will have to fight Russia itself.**

Claim: _Sending military aid to Ukraine degrades America's military readiness_.

Fact: Sending military aid to Ukraine has enabled the United States to modernize its own military to be better prepared to fight the next war.

*   The US is supporting Ukraine in part so that the US won’t have to fight Russia itself.
*   The overwhelming majority of military assistance is going to build up the US defense industrial base.\[23\]  It is allowing the expansion of current production lines of essential military supplies that the US military will need in any future war.
*   The equipment the US has been giving Ukraine is mostly old and sometimes inoperable.\[24\]  The US is purchasing new systems to replace what it gives Ukraine, modernizing the American military in the process.
*   American allies are also reinvigorating their defense industries and modernizing their militaries as consequences of support to Ukraine, which benefits the US.\[25\]

**The United States is not sending Ukraine a “blank check.”**

Claim: _The United States is/was sending Ukraine a "blank check."_

Fact: The United States has not given Ukraine a blank check. <image:3836>

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Associated Press interviewed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on February 1, 2025.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence does not support the claim. The AP interview with Zelenskyy does not mention the amount of U.S. aid received by Ukraine. Furthermore, the DoD OIG audit revealed that the DoD did not provide sufficient documentation to support the justification or accuracy of half of the total funds. However, the ISW fact sheet states that US aid to Ukraine is not a "blank check" and that both Ukrainian and US officials monitor the aid.

The claim's assertion that Zelenskyy's statement confirms the aid is a money-laundering operation is not supported by the evidence. The evidence does not provide any information about the nature of the aid or whether it is being used for money laundering.

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Department of Defense Office of Inspector General (DoD OIG) released an audit of the DoD’s execution of funds to assist Ukraine, revealing that the DoD did not provide sufficient documentation to support the justification or accuracy of half of the total funds, $1.1 billion. The report is titled "Audit of the DoD’s Execution of Funds to Assist Ukraine (Report No. DODIG-2025-007)" ([Source](https://www.dodig.mil/In-the-Spotlight/Article/3940692/press-release-audit-of-the-dods-execution-of-funds-to-assist-ukraine-report-no/)).

The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) published a fact sheet dated February 8, 2024, addressing claims about US aid to Ukraine. The fact sheet states that US aid to Ukraine is not a "blank check" and that Congress appropriates specific amounts for specific purposes, with both Ukrainian and US officials monitoring the aid. It also mentions that America’s European, Asian, and NATO allies have committed over $178 billion to support Ukraine, which is more than the US will have committed counting the aid package currently under consideration. <image:3835> and <image:3836> ([Source](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/fact-sheet-us-assistance-ukraine)).


## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim. The AP interview with Zelenskyy does not mention the amount of U.S. aid received by Ukraine. Furthermore, the DoD OIG audit revealed that the DoD did not provide sufficient documentation to support the justification or accuracy of half of the total funds. However, the ISW fact sheet states that US aid to Ukraine is not a "blank check" and that both Ukrainian and US officials monitor the aid.

The claim's assertion that Zelenskyy's statement confirms the aid is a money-laundering operation is not supported by the evidence. The evidence does not provide any information about the nature of the aid or whether it is being used for money laundering.

## Evidence
No new evidence found.

## Elaboration
The claim cannot be verified. The AP interview with Zelenskyy does not mention the amount of U.S. aid. While the DoD OIG audit revealed documentation issues, it does not confirm the aid is a money-laundering operation. The ISW fact sheet indicates oversight of the aid. More information is needed to verify the claim.

 According to the whistleblower, the call was part of a wider campaign by Trump, his administration, and Giuliani to pressure Ukraine into investigating the Bidens, which may have included Trump's cancelling a scheduled trip to Ukraine by Vice President [Mike Pence](/wiki/Mike_Pence "Mike Pence")

Former acting chief of staff [Mick Mulvaney](/wiki/Mick_Mulvaney "Mick Mulvaney")

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Associated Press interviewed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on February 1, 2025. The interview, also covered by U.S. News & World Report, focused on Zelenskyy's concerns about excluding Ukraine from U.S.-Russia talks and his views on NATO membership. The AP article does not mention the amount of U.S. aid received by Ukraine.

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Department of Defense Office of Inspector General (DoD OIG) released an audit of the DoD’s execution of funds to assist Ukraine, revealing that the DoD did not provide sufficient documentation to support the justification or accuracy of half of the total funds, $1.1 billion. The report is titled "Audit of the DoD’s Execution of Funds to Assist Ukraine (Report No. DODIG-2025-007)" ([Source](https://www.dodig.mil/In-the-Spotlight/Article/3940692/press-release-audit-of-the-dods-execution-of-funds-to-assist-ukraine-report-no/)).

The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) published a fact sheet dated February 8, 2024, addressing claims about US aid to Ukraine. The fact sheet states that US aid to Ukraine is not a "blank check" and that Congress appropriates specific amounts for specific purposes, with both Ukrainian and US officials monitoring the aid. It also mentions that America’s European, Asian, and NATO allies have committed over $178 billion to support Ukraine, which is more than the US will have committed counting the aid package currently under consideration. <image:3835> and <image:3836> ([Source](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/fact-sheet-us-assistance-ukraine)).


## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim. The AP interview with Zelenskyy does not mention the amount of U.S. aid received by Ukraine. Furthermore, the DoD OIG audit revealed that the DoD did not provide sufficient documentation to support the justification or accuracy of half of the total funds. However, the ISW fact sheet states that US aid to Ukraine is not a "blank check" and that both Ukrainian and US officials monitor the aid.

The claim's assertion that Zelenskyy's statement confirms the aid is a money-laundering operation is not supported by the evidence. The evidence does not provide any information about the nature of the aid or whether it is being used for money laundering.

The SBU said defence officials signed a contract for 100,000 mortar shells in August 2022, but no arms were ever provided

**Ukraine's security service says it has uncovered corruption in an arms purchase by the military worth about $40m (£31m).**

The SBU said five senior people in the defence ministry and at an arms supplier were being investigated.

It said the defence officials signed a contract for 100,000 mortar shells in August 2022.

Payment was made in advance, with some funds transferred abroad, but no arms were ever provided.

Corruption has been a major stumbling block in Ukraine's bid to join the European Union.

The SBU said an investigation had "exposed" officials of the ministry of defence and managers of arms supplier Lviv Arsenal, "who stole nearly 1.5 billion hryvnias in the purchase of shells".

"According to the investigation, former and current high-ranking officials of the Ministry of Defence and heads of affiliated companies are involved in the embezzlement," it said.

The SBU said that despite the contract for the shells having being agreed six months after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, "not a single artillery shell" was ever sent.

One of the suspects was detained while attempting to leave Ukraine and is currently in custody, the SBU said.

Ukraine's prosecutor general says the stolen funds have been seized and will be returned to the defence budget.

Issues surrounding corruption have dogged Ukraine for years.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky cited the fight against corruption as one of his main priorities when he came to power in 2019.

The latest allegations come as Republicans in the United States push back on President Joe Biden's efforts to send more aid to Ukraine.

In August, President Zelensky fired all the officials in charge of military recruitment to end a system in which some people were being allowed to escape conscription.

Ukraine was ranked 116th out of 180 countries in a [2022 corruption perceptions index](https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2022)
 by campaigning and research organisation Transparency International.

But anti-corruption efforts are beginning to make a difference.

## Claim
Claim: "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's statement in an AP news interview from February 1, 2025 that his country's military has received only a portion of the more than 175 billion in U.S. aid confirms that the US aid is a money laundering operation."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Associated Press interviewed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on February 1, 2025. The interview, also covered by U.S. News & World Report, focused on Zelenskyy's concerns about excluding Ukraine from U.S.-Russia talks and his views on NATO membership. The AP article does not mention the amount of U.S. aid received by Ukraine.

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Department of Defense Office of Inspector General (DoD OIG) released an audit of the DoD’s execution of funds to assist Ukraine, revealing that the DoD did not provide sufficient documentation to support the justification or accuracy of half of the total funds, $1.1 billion. The report is titled "Audit of the DoD’s Execution of Funds to Assist Ukraine (Report No. DODIG-2025-007)" ([Source](https://www.dodig.mil/In-the-Spotlight/Article/3940692/press-release-audit-of-the-dods-execution-of-funds-to-assist-ukraine-report-no/)).

The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) published a fact sheet dated February 8, 2024, addressing claims about US aid to Ukraine. The fact sheet states that US aid to Ukraine is not a "blank check" and that Congress appropriates specific amounts for specific purposes, with both Ukrainian and US officials monitoring the aid. It also mentions that America’s European, Asian, and NATO allies have committed over $178 billion to support Ukraine, which is more than the US will have committed counting the aid package currently under consideration. <image:3835> and <image:3836> ([Source](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/fact-sheet-us-assistance-ukraine)).


## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim. The AP interview with Zelenskyy does not mention the amount of U.S. aid received by Ukraine. Furthermore, the DoD OIG audit revealed that the DoD did not provide sufficient documentation to support the justification or accuracy of half of the total funds. However, the ISW fact sheet states that US aid to Ukraine is not a "blank check" and that both Ukrainian and US officials monitor the aid.

The claim's assertion that Zelenskyy's statement confirms the aid is a money-laundering operation is not supported by the evidence. The evidence does not provide any information about the nature of the aid or whether it is being used for money laundering.

The AP interview does not mention the amount of US aid. While there are reports of corruption in Ukraine, including an arms purchase uncovered by Ukraine's security service, this does not directly link the US aid to money laundering.

The BBC News reported on January 28, 2024, that Ukraine's security service uncovered corruption in an arms purchase by the military worth about $40m ([https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68120973](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68120973)) <image:4464>, <image:4465>.


## Elaboration
The claim cannot be verified. The evidence does not support the claim that Zelenskyy's statement confirms the US aid is a money-laundering operation. The AP interview does not mention the amount of US aid. While there are reports of corruption in Ukraine, including an arms purchase uncovered by Ukraine's security service, this does not directly link the US aid to money laundering.


## Final Judgement
The claim is not supported by the evidence. The AP interview with Zelenskyy does not mention the amount of U.S. aid. While there are reports of corruption in Ukraine, this does not directly link the US aid to money laundering.

`false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is not supported by the evidence. The AP interview with Zelenskyy, as reported by the [AP News](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-trump-talks-ceasefire-00af5f61f1faf41e78a3b4e072c21a14), does not mention the amount of U.S. aid. While there are reports of corruption in Ukraine, such as the one reported by [BBC News](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68120973), this does not directly link the US aid to money laundering.

FSWC Calls for Canadians to Stand with Israel

### News Release

[< Back to News Room](/news)

‍

**Statement from FSWC**

**Toronto (October 7, 2023)** - Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center (FSWC) is devastated by today’s horrific news from Israel concerning the many Israelis killed or wounded in the murderous, multi-front assault by Hamas terrorists.

We extend our condolences and deepest sympathies to the families of those killed in this abhorrent, unprovoked attack on civilians. We express our wishes for a full and speedy recovery to those wounded and pray for the safe return of all those kidnapped and taken to Gaza as hostages by the Hamas invaders.

We condemn, in the harshest terms, the actions of Palestinian terror groups in firing thousands of rockets indiscriminately at civilian targets in Israel and massacring residents in numerous villages and towns, actions that constitute heinous war crimes that shouldn’t go unpunished.

FSWC thanks senior police officials in Toronto, York and Peel regions after they informed us that they have devoted additional resources to ensure the safety and security of Jewish residents and Jewish community institutions given the antisemitic attacks that took place two years ago in Toronto during the last major conflict between Israel and Palestinian terror groups in Gaza.

**FSWC President and CEO Michael Levitt issued the following statement:**

“We appreciate the strong support for Israel already expressed by leaders in our country, including the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and many others at all levels of government and many community organizations. We call on all Canadians to stand in solidarity with Israel, to unequivocally condemn today’s appalling attacks against Israelis and to speak out against the actions of the Palestinian terrorists and those who support them, including their backers in Iran.”

On December 28, 2024, Yahya Sare’e, the spokesperson for the Houthis, [announced](https://x.com/AmeenHa2024yan/status/1873057956704731540)
 that a Houthi surface-to-air missile shot down a US MQ-9 Reaper unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) overflying the Al Bayda governorate in Yemen. Despite their protracted deployment, the number of US drones lost to hostile fire was minimal, with only three MQ-9 Reapers shot down by the Houthis between [2017](https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/aviation/news/a28469/us-reaper-drone-shot-down-over-yemen/)
 and [2019](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security-usa-drone-idUSKCN1VB180/)
.

During the Houthis’ anti-shipping campaign, there has been a marked escalation in the group’s tactical proficiency against US drones. Four days later, the Houthis [boasted](https://x.com/AmeenHa2024yan/status/1874346837530087576)
 the downing of a second US-made drone in the Marib governorate, marking the first Houthi strike of an MQ-9 Reaper in 2025.

These attacks represent the latest in a long string of successful Houthi strikes against US UAVs since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war, showcasing the Houthis’ growing offensive capabilities. 

For the Yemeni militant group, imposing a heavy toll on the US drone fleet serves tactical, strategic, and symbolic goals at the domestic and regional levels. The strikes against MQ-9 Reaper drones impair US intelligence and targeting systems and help the Houthis shore up domestic and regional support. And, with the Houthis’ ties to China, Russia, and Iran, downed MQ-9 Reaper drones could end up in the hands of US adversaries. 

Given the benefits the Houthis continue to enjoy from shooting down these drones, the United States needs to adjust its drone deployment strategy to ensure that MQ-9 Reapers are less vulnerable to the militant group’s attacks. 

#### **The offensive**

The surge of attacks on US UAVs and the anti-shipping campaign are major pieces of the Houthi’s latest offensive. Since November 2023, the Houthis [have claimed](https://english.almasirah.net.ye/post/44879/)
 responsibility for downing fourteen MQ-9 Reaper drones, in a series of attacks that have targeted US assets primarily in Marib and Sa’ada governorates. The Houthi arsenal of surface-to-air missiles [includes](https://www.csis.org/analysis/missile-war-yemen)
 Russian-made missiles originating from prewar Yemeni army stocks, such as the SA-6/Faster (Innovator) surface-to-air missile and the Thaqib (Piercer) missile family. However, those designs are either variants of Iranian weapon systems or based on Iran’s technology, such as the Sayyad-2C (Hunter) missile, the Saqr series (Iran’s 358 missile), and the Barq missile family (Iran’s Taer series). 

#### **Inside the Houthis’ strategy**

Tactically, the Houthi shootdowns of MQ-9 drones primarily aim to blind the US intelligence and targeting systems. The Houthis’ efforts to conceal strategic sites have heightened the Western coalition’s dependence on UAVs to collect actionable intelligence on military installations.

For the Houthis, the shootdowns of US drones also hold symbolic value. The shootdowns of US drones boost morale for Houthi supporters at a time of great hardship under Western and Israeli air strikes. Factual or not, these claims serve to inflate the Houthis’ perceived combat strength and burnish their image as a militia capable of confronting US forces head-on.

#### **The Houthis’ dangerous partners**

Although the MQ-9 Reapers have been shot down over Yemen, the negative ramifications of these Houthi attacks on US military assets could spill over beyond the country’s borders."

WASHINGTON (AP) — Houthi rebels in Yemen have shot down seven U.S. Reaper drones in less than six weeks, a loss of aircraft worth more than $200 million in what is becoming the most dramatic cost to the Pentagon of the military campaign against the [Iran-backed militants.](https://apnews.com/hub/houthis)

According to defense officials, three of the drones were shot down in the past week — suggesting the militants’ targeting of the unmanned aircraft flying over Yemen has improved. strikes at the Ras Isa fuel terminal in Yemen last week potentially killed more than 70 civilians.

“Military leaders agree that ingraining civilian harm mitigation practices within U.S operations leads to better outcomes and that civilian casualties actually undermine the mission that the military has been sent in to do,” their letter said.

In addition to downing the drones, the Houthis have been persistently firing missiles and one-way attack drones at U.S. has been using an array of warships, fighter jets, bombers and drones to strike the Houthis, and aircraft can now launch from two Navy carriers in the region.

Hegseth decided in March to beef up the Navy warship presence in the Middle East, ordering the USS Harry S. had committed that much warship power to the Middle East.

The Houthis have been waging [persistent missile and drone attacks](https://apnews.com/article/yemen-houthi-israel-hamas-red-sea-shipping-ab6fee82e73170b7e2edbab90ed6c14c)
 against commercial and military ships in the region in what the group’s leadership has described as an effort to end the Israeli war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.

From November 2023 until this January, the Houthis targeted more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two of them and [killing four sailors.](https://apnews.com/article/houthi-rebels-ship-attack-red-sea-yemen-bfa7d321e55c5bb59b268b82ef3c56ba)
 That has greatly reduced the flow of trade through the Red Sea corridor, which typically sees $1 trillion of goods move through it annually.

### Operation Prosperity Guardian: American-led military coalition

While the US Navy has shot down Houthi rockets and missiles in the Red Sea, it has not retaliated against those firing them.[\[204\]](#cite_note-212)
[\[205\]](#cite_note-EscortTalk-213)
 In December 2023, after discussions with allies, the US announced the creation of a multilateral naval task force of protective escorts for commercial vessels in the Bab-el-Mandeb strait and [Gulf of Aden](/wiki/Gulf_of_Aden "Gulf of Aden")
 region.[\[205\]](#cite_note-EscortTalk-213)
 The operation, codenamed [Operation Prosperity Guardian](/wiki/Operation_Prosperity_Guardian "Operation Prosperity Guardian")
,[\[206\]](#cite_note-214)
 was formally launched on 23 December 2023.[\[176\]](#cite_note-Gronholt-pedersen-184)
 It is similar to past operations protecting commercial vessels from attack, including in the [Persian Gulf](/wiki/Persian_Gulf "Persian Gulf")
 and [Strait of Hormuz](/wiki/Strait_of_Hormuz "Strait of Hormuz")
 during the "[Tanker War](/wiki/Tanker_War "Tanker War")
" of the 1980s,[\[205\]](#cite_note-EscortTalk-213)
 and the ongoing maritime security operations of [Combined Task Force 153](/wiki/Combined_Task_Force_153 "Combined Task Force 153")
, the US Navy-led task force based in [Bahrain](/wiki/Bahrain "Bahrain")
.[\[164\]](#cite_note-Wintour2023-172)
 The operation has also been compared to the successful multilateral naval campaign a decade earlier to combat [Somali pirates off the Horn of Africa](/wiki/Piracy_off_the_coast_of_Somalia "Piracy off the coast of Somalia")
, although the Houthis, unlike the Somali pirates, enjoy Iranian support, and better equipment and technology, such as helicopters, drones, missiles, and speedboats.[\[207\]](#cite_note-215)

#### Independent naval patrols for maritime security

France, Italy and India have all independently sent naval assets to the region, with the [French frigate _Languedoc_](/wiki/French_frigate_Languedoc "French frigate Languedoc")
 intercepting drones launched from a Houthi-controlled port while Italy has sent the frigate [_Virginio Fasan_](/wiki/Italian_frigate_Virginio_Fasan_(F_591) "Italian frigate Virginio Fasan (F 591)")
 under the Secure Mediterranean operation.[\[16\]](#cite_note-itdec-20)
 India has also sent two [_Kolkata_\-class destroyers](/wiki/Kolkata-class_destroyer "Kolkata-class destroyer")
 to strengthen maritime security in the Red Sea.[\[20\]](#cite_note-HT19dec-24)

### Pro-Palestinian protests

Main article: [Houthi attacks on commercial vessels](/wiki/Houthi_attacks_on_commercial_vessels "Houthi attacks on commercial vessels")

Houthi forces began attacking shipping vessels affiliated with [Israel](/wiki/Israel "Israel")
 passing through the Red Sea on 19 November 2023. The video game's developers, [Bohemia Interactive](/wiki/Bohemia_Interactive "Bohemia Interactive")
, said that action taken against the videos was ineffective, saying: "With every video flagged, debunked, or taken down, ten more can be uploaded each day."[\[122\]](#cite_note-cbsnews20240605-130)
 Footage from the video game has also been misrepresented as attacks on shipping[\[128\]](#cite_note-136)
 and a US fighter jet being shot down by the Houthis over Sanaa.[\[129\]](#cite_note-137)

The **Red Sea crisis** ([Arabic](/wiki/Arabic_language "Arabic language")
: أزمة البحر الأحمر) began on 19 October 2023, when the [Iran-backed](/wiki/Iran-backed "Iran-backed")
 [Houthis](/wiki/Houthis "Houthis")
 in [Yemen](/wiki/Yemen "Yemen")
 launched missiles and armed drones at [Israel](/wiki/Israel "Israel")
, demanding an end to the [invasion of the Gaza Strip](/wiki/Israeli_invasion_of_the_Gaza_Strip "Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip")
.[\[84\]](#cite_note-aljazeera20231219-92)
[\[85\]](#cite_note-AP14Jun2024-93)
 The Houthis have since [seized or bombarded dozens of merchant and naval vessels](/wiki/Houthi_attacks_on_commercial_vessels "Houthi attacks on commercial vessels")
 in the [Red Sea](/wiki/Red_Sea "Red Sea")
 and received hundreds of retaliatory air strikes by US and allied forces.[\[86\]](#cite_note-Diakun-94)
 The crisis is linked to the [Gaza war](/wiki/Gaza_war "Gaza war")

Since 2014, the Houthis, who oppose [Yemen's internationally recognized government](/wiki/Presidential_Leadership_Council "Presidential Leadership Council")
, have controlled a considerable swath of the country's territory along the [Red Sea](/wiki/Red_Sea "Red Sea")
. The sources also stated that Iran has escalated its provision of advanced drones, anti-ship cruise missiles, precision-strike ballistic missiles, and medium-range missiles to the Houthis, since the outbreak of the Gaza war.[\[3\]](#cite_note-hez-4)

US officials told _[Semafor](/wiki/Semafor_(website) "Semafor (website)")
_ that commanders and advisors from Iran's [Revolutionary Guards](/wiki/Revolutionary_Guards "Revolutionary Guards")
 are currently stationed in Yemen, and are directly involved in the Houthi attacks on commercial traffic in the Red Sea. The [Qods Force](/wiki/Qods_Force "Qods Force")
, has overseen the transfer of the attack drones, cruise missiles, and medium-range ballistic missiles which have been used in the strikes on Red Sea and Israeli targets in recent weeks.[\[1\]](#cite_note-semafor-2)

According to Western intelligence officials, the Iranian [Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps](/wiki/Islamic_Revolutionary_Guard_Corps "Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps")
 placed an intelligence gathering ship to guide Houthi attacks on ships that switch off radios and identifiers.[\[130\]](#cite_note-138)

In July 2024, the [Defense Intelligence Agency](/wiki/Defense_Intelligence_Agency "Defense Intelligence Agency")
 reported that the Houthis used an Iranian-made missile in their attack on the Norwegian-flagged _Strinda_ on 11 December 2023. The officials did not elaborate on how Iran was helping the Houthis, but Michael Knights of the American think tank [Washington Institute for Near East Policy](/wiki/The_Washington_Institute_for_Near_East_Policy "The Washington Institute for Near East Policy")
 said the Houthis received Iranian surface-to-air missiles, such as the [358](/wiki/358_missile "358 missile")
 and [SA-2](/wiki/S-75_Dvina "S-75 Dvina")
, that allowed them to improve their air defenses and target US drones.[\[135\]](#cite_note-143)

#### North Korea

#### Russia

In July 2024, _[The Wall Street Journal](/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal "The Wall Street Journal")

 during [Russia's invasion](/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine "Russian invasion of Ukraine")

_, citing a US official, reported that personnel of Russia's [GRU](/wiki/GRU_(Russian_Federation) "GRU (Russian Federation)")
 were stationed in Houthi-controlled parts of Yemen to assist the militia's attacks on merchant ships.[\[143\]](#cite_note-151)

In October 2024, _[The Wall Street Journal](/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal "The Wall Street Journal")

Renovated in 2018, the facility in Toropets is estimated to have stored tonnes upon tonnes of military goods, including explosives, artillery shells and ballistic missiles.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A Ukrainian drone attack on a significant Russian weapons stockpile in the Tver region in the early hours of Wednesday might be the Ukrainian army's biggest hit against Moscow's arsenal since early 2022.

The blast from the strike was so strong that earthquake monitoring stations picked it up as if it were a minor earthquake, while NASA reported a series of heat sources spotted by its equipment from space.

The facility in Toropets is estimated to have stored around 30,000 tonnes of military munitions. The destruction of the ammunition that was stored there will most likely negatively affect the northern operational group of the Russian army.

But what is the Russian military storage facility in Toropets and how important is it?

Renovated in 2018, the facility in Toropets is estimated to have stored tonnes upon tonnes of military goods, including explosives, artillery shells and ballistic missiles.

The former Russian deputy defence minister Dmitry Bulgakov — who was arrested earlier this year on corruption charges — said after the renovations that the site met the "highest international standards" and could defend weapons from missiles and "even a small nuclear attack".

The storage site covered an area of over 5 square kilometres in size and a perimeter of more than 12 kilometres long. 

**Which missiles were stored at the facility?**
-----------------------------------------------

The town of Toropets is situated around 470 kilometers north of the Ukrainian border and the destruction of the ammunition that was stored there will most likely negatively affect the northern operational group of the Russian army, including the supply of troops in Kursk, Belgorod and Bryansk.

According to Ukrainian sources, the military site in Toropets reportedly housed fuel tanks, as well as missiles intended for Iskander missile systems, Tochka-U missile systems, guided aerial bombs and assorted artillery ammunition.

The head of Ukraine's Centre for Countering Disinformation, Andriy Kovalenko, said that in addition to its own ammunition, Russia had also started to store North Korean munitions in Toropets.

Maxar satellite service collected imagery clearly shows the extent of the damage from the Ukrainian drone attack causing a series of explosions, according to a photo shared by the Russia Team Lead at the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). 

The imagery shows large pillars of smoke covering much of the area, while a closer look at the ammunition storage area indicates that fires continue to burn in and near some bunkers, ISW's George Barros added.

**Have the storage bunkers been destroyed?**
--------------------------------------------

Most of the ammunition is presumably stored underground, so the question is whether Ukraine used any drones that could have penetrated inside the bunkers.

A full damage assessment remains impossible due to the thick smoke above the site. However, the possible destruction of the bunkers might have also been the result of Moscow not respecting its own regulations by placing the bunkers too close together, for example.

While repeatedly calling on the West to lift the restrictions over the use of long-range missiles deep into Russian territory, Ukraine has been using its home-produced UAVs to strike as deep as 1,800 kilometres into Russia, as was the case in the city of Orsk.

LONDON, Sept 18 (Reuters) - A large-scale Ukrainian drone attack on Russia triggered an earthquake-sized blast at a major arsenal in the Tver region on Wednesday, forcing the evacuation of a nearby town, war bloggers and some media reported.

Unverified video and images on social media showed a huge ball of flame blasting into the night sky and multiple detonations thundering across a lake about 380 km (240 miles) west of Moscow.

 in the area.

"The enemy hit an ammunition depot in the area of Toropets," said Yuri Podolyaka, a Ukrainian-born, pro-Russian military blogger. "Everything that can burn is already burning there (and exploding)."

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, speaking in his nightly video address, hailed the outcome of the attack without referring specifically to the target.

"A very important result was achieved last night on Russian territory and such actions weaken the enemy," Zelenskiy said. "I thank everyone involved. Such precision is truly inspiring."

He thanked the SBU security service, the HUR intelligence service and the Special Operations Forces.

A source in Ukraine's SBU state security service had earlier told Reuters the drone attack had destroyed [a warehouse storing missiles](/world/europe/ukraine-destroyed-arsenal-russias-tver-region-kyiv-security-source-says-2024-09-18/)
, guided bombs and artillery ammunition.

Russian state media have in the past reported that a major arsenal for conventional weapons was located at the site of the blasts. State media, now subject to military censorship laws, was muted in its reporting on Wednesday.

Igor Rudenya, governor of the Tver region, said that Ukrainian drones had been shot down, that a fire had broken out and that some residents were being evacuated. He did not say what was burning.

One woman told Reuters that members of her family had been evacuated from Toropets.

"A fire started with explosions," said the woman, who identified herself only as Irina.

Rudenya later said the situation in Toropets was stable as of midday local time (0900 GMT) and that evacuated residents could return. The fire had been put out and there were no recorded fatalities, he said.

Russia and Ukraine each reported dozens of enemy drone attacks on their territory overnight, with Russian forces advancing in eastern [Ukraine](https://www.reuters.com/topic/event/ukraine-crisis/)
.

MAJOR EXPLOSION
---------------

The size of the main blast shown in the unverified social media video was consistent with 200-240 tons of high explosives detonating, said George William Herbert of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey in California.

A Toropets chatroom on the Russian social media site VK was flooded with messages of support from other parts of the country and offers of help to people fleeing the town.

Some people were asking whether buildings at specific addresses were still standing.

"People, does anyone know what's happened to Kudino village??? They told me nothing is left of our house," posted one woman.

Another woman replied: "It's horror there." Kudino is a village 4.5 km (2.8 miles) northeast of Toropets.

Some war bloggers asked how drones could trigger such large blasts at what was thought to be a highly fortified facility.

According to an RIA state news agency report from 2018, Russia was building an arsenal for the storage of missiles, ammunition and explosives in Toropets, a 1,000-year-old town, with a population of just over 11,000.

Dmitry Bulgakov, then a deputy defence minister, told RIA in 2018 that the facility could defend weapons from missiles and even a small nuclear attack. Bulgakov was arrested earlier this year on corruption charges, which he denies.

"It (the concrete facilities) ensures their reliable and safe storage, protects them from air and missile strikes and even from the damaging factors of a nuclear explosion," RIA quoted Bulgakov as saying at the time.

Some Russians on chat groups expressed anger.

"Why wasn't the ammunition underground?! What are you doing???? In Kudino, houses were blown away! Why is the forest burning and no one is there... What kind of negligence is this!!!!" one woman posted.

Russia reported that its air defence units had destroyed 54 drones launched against five Russian regions overnight, without mentioning Tver. Ukraine said it had [shot down 46 of 52 drones](/world/europe/russian-drones-attack-energy-facilities-ukraines-sumy-authorities-say-2024-09-18/)
 launched by Moscow overnight and that Russia had used three guided air missiles which did not reach their targets.

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian [drones struck a large military depot in a town deep inside Russia](https://apnews.com/article/poland-us-blinken-duda-ukraine-54232b14cae7785df02f9d48a77e7823)
 overnight, causing a huge fire and forcing some residents to evacuate, a Ukrainian official and Russian news reports said Wednesday. At least 13 people were injured, Russia’s Health Ministry added.

Meanwhile, a senior U.S. diplomat said [Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-kursk-incursion-gamble-battlefield-e862afd58c65d6d2d5b7b3747423ca4d)
 has a workable plan to end the war, now in its third year, although its details have not been publicly disclosed.

Ukraine claimed the strike destroyed military warehouses in Toropets, a town in Russia’s Tver region about 380 kilometers (240 miles) northwest of Moscow and about 500 kilometers (300 miles) from the border with Ukraine.

The attack was carried out by Ukraine’s Security Service, along with Ukraine’s Intelligence and Special Operations Forces, a Kyiv security official told The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the operation.

According to the official, the depot housed Iskander and Tochka-U missiles, as well as glide bombs and artillery shells. He said the facility caught fire in the strike and was burning across an area 6 kilometers (4 miles) wide.

Among the destroyed ammunition were North Korean KN-23 short-range ballistic missiles, another official, in Ukraine’s Intelligence Office, told AP. He also was not authorized to comment publicly and didn’t provide evidence to support his claim.

Russia and North Korea signed [a landmark pact](https://apnews.com/article/russia-putin-kim-north-korea-pact-556492779b6a32c4cf74b992741d91a8)
 in June that envisioned mutual military assistance between Moscow and Pyongyang.

More than 100 domestically produced exploding drones were deployed in the attack on the depot, the Ukrainian intelligence official added.

Russian state news agency RIA Novosti quoted regional authorities as saying air defense systems were working to repel a “massive drone attack” on Toropets, which has a population of about 11,000. The agency also reported a fire and the evacuations, and the Health Ministry said 13 people were hospitalized in the region after the attack.

Tver regional Gov. Igor Rudenya later said all evacuees could return home.

Successful Ukrainian strikes deep inside Russia have become more common as Kyiv developed its drone technology.

Zelenskyy also is seeking approval from Western nations for Ukraine to use the sophisticated weapons they are providing to hit targets inside Russia. Some Western leaders have balked at that, fearing they could be dragged into the conflict.

Part of Kyiv’s strategy is targeting of military equipment, ammunition and infrastructure deep inside Russia, as well as making civilians feel some of the consequences of the war that is being fought largely inside Ukraine.

The swift push by Ukrainian forces [into Russia’s Kursk border region](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-kursk-incursion-putin-1178b99b32b476816db3a48ffa06b11a)
 last month fits into that plan, which apparently seeks to compel Russian President Vladimir Putin to back down.

Putin, however, has shown no signs of that [and has been trying to grind down Ukraine’s resolve](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-putin-military-numbers-9c5554302486adfe7b3d69cb297f8a98)
 through attritional warfare and also sap the West’s support for Kyiv by drawing out the conflict. That has come at a price, however, as the U.K. Defense Ministry estimates the war has probably killed or wounded more than 600,000 Russian troops.

On Tuesday, Putin ordered the country’s military to [increase its number of troops](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-putin-military-numbers-9c5554302486adfe7b3d69cb297f8a98)
 by 180,000 to a total of 1.5 million by Dec. 1.

Zelenskyy announced his war plan in his nightly address on Monday, saying it’s 90% ready and will be presented to allies over the next week.

He said Ukraine’s [plan for victory](https://apnews.com/video/ukraine-government-kyiv-volodymyr-zelenskyy-ukraine-war-and-unrest-be06ac55f33246fd96f1898bac5a6884)
 includes not only battlefield goals but also diplomatic and economic wins. The plan has been kept under wraps but the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said at a news conference Tuesday that Washington officials have seen it.

“We think it lays out a strategy and a plan that can work,” she said, adding that the United States will bring it up with other world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly in New York next week. She did not comment on what the plan contained.

Intelligence about the depot's munitions, its vulnerabilities, and nearby Russian defensive systems was provided to Ukraine by the [Central Intelligence Agency](/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency "Central Intelligence Agency")
. The depot reportedly stored not only artillery shells, but also [Iskander](/wiki/Iskander "Iskander")
 missiles, [Tochka-U](/wiki/Tochka-U "Tochka-U")
 ballistic missiles and [glide bombs](/wiki/Glide_bomb "Glide bomb")
 and it is unclear if his [bomb damage assessment](/wiki/Bomb_damage_assessment "Bomb damage assessment")
 includes both missiles and artillery ammunition.[\[23\]](#cite_note-23)

Video shows explosions after drone attack on Russian ammunition depot

00:58

CNN  — 

A Ukrainian drone attack launched overnight destroyed an ammunition depot in the western Russian region of Tver, a source from Ukraine’s Security Service (SBU) told CNN on Wednesday, causing a massive blast.

The Ukrainian drones targeted the Russian defense ministry-operated warehouse in the city of Toropets, which was storing Iskander tactical missile systems, Tochka-U tactical missile systems, guided aerial bombs and artillery ammunition, the source said.

Large fires broke out from the debris of drones repelled by local air defenses, the regional government said, prompting the governor, Igor Rudenya, to order a partial evacuation of the area during the early hours of Wednesday.

Earthquake monitors now believe explosions from the drone attack may have generated seismic activity. Ben Dando, a seismologist at the Norwegian seismology research foundation NORSAR, told CNN that its sensors “detected seismic signals, of magnitude 2.5 to 2.8, in northwest Russia which look to be associated with the drone attack launched by Ukraine.”

NORSAR, which has been using seismic monitors since 2022 to evaluate the impact of the war in Ukraine, is currently analyzing the preliminary data to capture the full extent of the blast, Dando added.

Satellite images taken by Maxar Technologies on Wednesday morning showed huge plumes of smoke rising up from several depot buildings, as well as extensive damage to the buildings and nearby forest.

Fires continue to burn, as seen in the Maxar Technologies images.

Russian state news agency TASS reported that a drone attack had been launched on the city of Toropets overnight causing a fire “due to the fall of debris,” without specifically mentioning any targeting of a weapons facility.

Videos circulating on social media, verified by CNN, showed loud detonations and multiple buildings in the depot complex on fire.

Affected residents, including 11 children, have already been evacuated to the settlements of Kunya and Velikiye Luki in the neighbouring Pskov region, TASS said. No civilians are thought to have been injured in the drone attack, the news agency reported, citing Rudenya.

“Now we are engaged in evacuating the population, residents, maintaining public order,” Rudenya said in a later video statement, stressing that multiple emergency service units were involved in the response.

Rudenya made the call to evacuate so emergency services at the scene could work fully to bring the blazes under control, the local government said in a post on its official Telegram channel.

The Ukrainian security source told CNN that attacks of this nature are being used “methodically” to reduce Russia’s missile potential, adding that plans for further attacks on “similar” Russian military facilities are “proceeding.”

Toropets is located around 300 miles from the Ukrainian border and about 250 miles west of Moscow.

Ukraine has been pushing its key allies, including the United States, to give the go-ahead to carry out missile strikes on targets deeper into Russian territory. Last week, Russian President Vladimir Putin [warned NATO members](https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/12/europe/putin-warns-nato-missiles-hnk-latam-intl/index.html)
 that lifting restrictions on Ukraine’s use of long-range missile systems would mean entering into war with Russia itself.
