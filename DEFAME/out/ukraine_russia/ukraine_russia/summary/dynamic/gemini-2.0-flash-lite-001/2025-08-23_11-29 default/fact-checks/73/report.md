## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image in the claim (![image 22](media/73.jpg)) is of an F-16 fighter jet that crashed into a warehouse near March Air Reserve Base in May 2019. The crash was caused by improperly installed parts in the aircraft's hydraulic system, not by Russian forces. The pilot ejected and survived.

The articles discussing the crash were published by The Press-Enterprise ([Source](https://www.pressenterprise.com/2020/05/01/heres-why-the-missiles-on-the-crashed-f-16-near-march-air-reserve-base-did-not-explode/)), Air & Space Forces Magazine ([Source](https://www.airandspaceforces.com/improperly-installed-parts-caused-f-16-to-crash-into-warehouse-in-may-2019/)), and The Sun ([Source](https://www.sbsun.com/2020/04/23/hydraulic-failure-caused-f-16-to-crash-near-march-base-last-year-air-force-says/)).

## Elaboration
The claim is inaccurate. The image depicts an F-16 fighter jet that crashed in a warehouse near March Air Reserve Base in May 2019 due to mechanical failure, not a Russian attack. However, there is evidence of Ukrainian F-16s being lost in combat with Russia.


## Final Judgement
The image in the claim shows an F-16 that crashed in 2019 due to mechanical failure, not a Russian attack. While there have been reports of Ukrainian F-16s being lost in combat with Russia, the image is misrepresented.

`false`
