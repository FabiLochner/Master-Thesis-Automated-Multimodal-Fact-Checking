Useful result: From [Source](https://globalinitiative.net/analysis/a-new-phase-of-arms-trafficking-in-ukraine/): 
Content: The Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime (GI-TOC) published an article on September 23, 2024, discussing the rise of arms trafficking in Ukraine. The article mentions the sale of US-made M240 machine guns for $8,000 and Soviet-type AGS-17 automatic grenade launchers for $6,000. It also notes seizures of heavier weapons, including an anti-aircraft gun and a US machine gun. The article highlights that tackling arms trafficking is a high priority for Ukrainian law enforcement. <image:1149>, <image:1150>, <image:1151>

The claim 'Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States' is false.
Justification: The investigation found evidence of corruption and arms trafficking in Ukraine, including the sale of US-made weapons, as reported by the [Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime](https://globalinitiative.net/analysis/a-new-phase-of-arms-trafficking-in-ukraine/). However, the evidence does not specify the percentage of arms being sold, thus the claim cannot be verified.

So, the overall veracity is: false
