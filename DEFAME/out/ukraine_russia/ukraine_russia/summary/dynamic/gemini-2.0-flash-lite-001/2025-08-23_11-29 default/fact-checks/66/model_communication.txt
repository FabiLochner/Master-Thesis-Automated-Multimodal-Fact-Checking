The **Soviet invasion of Manchuria**, formally known as the **Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation**[\[15\]](#cite_note-22)
 or simply the **Manchurian Operation** (Маньчжурская операция) and sometimes **Operation August Storm**,[\[1\]](#cite_note-Glantz-1)
 began on 9 August 1945 with the [Soviet](/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union")
 invasion of the [Empire of Japan](/wiki/Empire_of_Japan "Empire of Japan")
's [puppet state](/wiki/Puppet_state "Puppet state")
 of [Manchukuo](/wiki/Manchukuo "Manchukuo")
, which was situated in Japanese-occupied [Manchuria](/wiki/Manchuria "Manchuria")
. Soviet paratroopers destroyed the Kwantung Army from behind its own lines, while Japanese anti-tank shells bounced off the sides of Soviet tanks.[\[39\]](#cite_note-47)
 The Japanese forces in Manchuria retreated in fear.[\[40\]](#cite_note-48)

Japanese troops and able-bodied Japanese men in Manchuria were taken prisoner by the Russians and transported to labor camps in Siberia, where many Japanese men would die.[\[41\]](#cite_note-49)
 From the Russians' perspective, this was seen as revenge for Russia's defeat in the [Russo-Japanese War](/wiki/Russo-Japanese_War "Russo-Japanese War")
 of 1905.[\[42\]](#cite_note-50)
 The stories of how poorly the Soviets treated the Japanese were brought to [Beijing](/wiki/Beijing "Beijing")
 by Japanese evacuees of Manchuria, creating panic among the Japanese population; however, the Russians honored their agreement with Chiang Kai-shek by not entering China proper.[\[43\]](#cite_note-51)

Japanese communication infrastructure was poor, and the Japanese lost communication with forward units very early on. reports indicate that the Soviet troops that occupied Manchuria (about 700,000) also looted and terrorized the local people of Mukden and were not discouraged by Soviet authorities from "three days of rape and pillage." In Harbin, Soviet forces ignored protests from [Chinese Communist Party](/wiki/Communist_Party_of_China "Communist Party of China")
 leaders on the mass rape and looting.[\[62\]](#cite_note-FCJones-70)
[\[63\]](#cite_note-CSM-71)
[\[64\]](#cite_note-72)
[\[65\]](#cite_note-73)
[\[66\]](#cite_note-74)
[\[67\]](#cite_note-75)
 There were several incidents in which Chinese police forces in Manchuria arrested or even killed Soviet troops for committing various crimes, leading to some conflicts between the Soviet and Chinese authorities in Manchuria.[\[68\]](#cite_note-76)

During the [Soviet occupation of North Korea](/wiki/Soviet_Civil_Administration "Soviet Civil Administration")
, it was reported that Soviet soldiers committed rape against both [Japanese](/wiki/Japanese_people "Japanese people")
 and [Korean](/wiki/Koreans "Koreans")
 women alike in the northern half of the Korean peninsula.[\[69\]](#cite_note-77)
[\[70\]](#cite_note-78)
 Soviet soldiers also looted the property of both Japanese and Koreans living in northern Korea.[\[71\]](#cite_note-:0-79)
 The Soviets laid claim to Japanese enterprises in Manchuria and northern Korea and took valuable materials and industrial equipment.[\[62\]](#cite_note-FCJones-70)
[\[71\]](#cite_note-:0-79)

Konstantin Asmolov of the Center for Korean Research of the [Russian Academy of Sciences](/wiki/Russian_Academy_of_Sciences "Russian Academy of Sciences")
 dismisses Western accounts of Soviet violence against civilians in the Far East as exaggeration and rumor and contends that accusations of mass crimes by the Red Army inappropriately extrapolate isolated incidents regarding the nearly 2,000,000 Soviet troops in the Far East into mass crimes. **[^](#cite_ref-CSM_71-0)
    ** _Christian Science Monitor_, 12 October 1945, Japanese armies were guilty of appalling excesses, both in China and elsewhere, and had the Russians dealt harshly with only Japanese nationals in Manchuria this would have appeared as just retribution. The Japanese did not have any concrete evidence as to when or where any invasion would occur.[\[17\]](#cite_note-Drea-24)
 They had estimated that an attack was not likely before the spring of 1946, but the _[Stavka](/wiki/Stavka "Stavka")
_ had in fact been planning for a mid-August offensive, successfully [concealing the buildup](/wiki/Russian_military_deception "Russian military deception")
 of a force of 90 divisions. This attack involved the [1st Red Banner Army](/wiki/Soviet_First_Army "Soviet First Army")
, the [5th Army](/wiki/5th_Army_(Soviet_Union) "5th Army (Soviet Union)")
 and the [10th Mechanized Corps](/wiki/10th_Mechanized_Corps "10th Mechanized Corps")
 striking towards [Mudanjiang](/wiki/Mudanjiang "Mudanjiang")
 (or Mutanchiang).[\[1\]](#cite_note-Glantz-1)
 Once that city was captured, this force was to advance towards the cities of [Jilin](/wiki/Jilin "Jilin")
 (or Kirin), Changchun and Harbin.[\[1\]](#cite_note-Glantz-1)
 Its final objective was to link up with the forces of the Transbaikal Front at Changchun and Jilin thus closing the double envelopment movement.

As a secondary objective, the 1st Far Eastern Front was to prevent Japanese forces from escaping to [Korea](/wiki/Korea "Korea")
, and then invade the [Korean Peninsula](/wiki/Korean_Peninsula "Korean Peninsula")
 up to the [38th parallel](/wiki/38th_parallel_north#Korea "38th parallel north")
,[\[1\]](#cite_note-Glantz-1)
 establishing in the process what later became [North Korea](/wiki/North_Korea "North Korea")
. This secondary objective was to be carried out by the [25th Army](/wiki/25th_Army_(Soviet_Union) "25th Army (Soviet Union)")
.[\[1\]](#cite_note-Glantz-1)
 Meanwhile, the [35th Army](/wiki/35th_Army_(Russia) "35th Army (Russia)")
 was tasked with capturing the cities of [Boli](/wiki/Boli_County "Boli County")
 (or Poli), [Linkou](/w/index.php?title=Linkou,_Heilongjiang&action=edit&redlink=1 "Linkou, Heilongjiang (page does not exist)")

#### 2nd Far Eastern Front

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Soviet_invasion_of_Manchuria&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: 2nd Far Eastern Front")\
\]

The 2nd Far Eastern Front, under General [Maksim Purkayev](/wiki/Maksim_Purkayev "Maksim Purkayev")
, included:[\[1\]](#cite_note-Glantz-1)

*   [2nd Red Banner Army](/wiki/Soviet_Second_Army "Soviet Second Army")
    
*   [15th Army](/wiki/15th_Army_(Soviet_Union) "15th Army (Soviet Union)")
    
*   [16th Army](/wiki/16th_Army_(Soviet_Union) "16th Army (Soviet Union)")
     (whose 56th Rifle Corps was its only formation to see combat, on [South Sakhalin](/wiki/South_Sakhalin "South Sakhalin")
    )
*   [5th Separate Rifle Corps](/wiki/5th_Separate_Rifle_Corps "5th Separate Rifle Corps")
    
*   [Chuguevsk Operational Group](/w/index.php?title=Chuguevsk_Operational_Group&action=edit&redlink=1 "Chuguevsk Operational Group (page does not exist)")
    
*   [Amur Military Flotilla](/wiki/Amur_Military_Flotilla "Amur Military Flotilla")
    
*   [10th Air Army](/wiki/10th_Air_Army "10th Air Army")
    

The 2nd Far Eastern Front was deployed in a supporting attack role.[\[1\]](#cite_note-Glantz-1)
 Its objectives were the cities of Harbin and Qiqihar,[\[2\]](#cite_note-Battlefield_Series-2)
 and to prevent an orderly withdrawal to the south by the Japanese forces.[\[1\]](#cite_note-Glantz-1)
 The front also included the [88th Separate Rifle Brigade](/wiki/88th_Separate_Rifle_Brigade "88th Separate Rifle Brigade")
, composed of Chinese and Korean guerrillas of the [Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army](/wiki/Northeast_Anti-Japanese_United_Army "Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army")
 who had retreated into the USSR in the beginning of the 1940s. The Kwantung Army commanders were engaged in a planning exercise at the time of the invasion, and were away from their forces for the first eighteen hours of conflict.

The Russians treated the Japanese with the utmost cruelty after their deadly attack on Japan's Kwantung Army in Manchuria just days before Japan's surrender.[\[38\]](#cite_note-46)
 Japanese forces were overwhelmed by Soviet attacks."

Uncover fascinating moments from the past every day! Half of the Japanese inner Cabinet, called the Supreme War Direction Council, refused to surrender unless guarantees about Japan’s future were given by the Allies, especially regarding the position of the emperor, [Hirohito](/topics/world-war-ii/hirohito)
. The only Japanese civilians who even knew what happened at Hiroshima were either dead or suffering terribly.

Japan had not been too worried about the Soviet Union, so busy with the Germans on the Eastern front. The Japanese army went so far as to believe that they would not have to engage a Soviet attack until spring 1946. But the Soviets surprised them one day after the declaration of war with their invasion of Manchuria, an assault so strong (of the 850 Japanese soldiers engaged at Pingyanchen, 650 were killed or wounded within the first two days of fighting) that Emperor Hirohito began to plead with his War Council to reconsider surrender.

By the early 17th century, Russia had established its authority over all of [Siberia](https://www.britannica.com/place/Siberia)
, but its attempts to move southward were consistently blocked by [China](https://www.britannica.com/place/China)
. Japan, with its modernized army and navy, at once won a series of striking victories against the Chinese, who, in the [Treaty of Shimonoseki](https://www.britannica.com/event/Treaty-of-Shimonoseki)
 (April 17, 1895), ceded to Japan the [Kwantung (Liaodong) Peninsula](https://www.britannica.com/place/Liaodong-Peninsula)
, on which Port Arthur (now [Dalian](https://www.britannica.com/place/Dalian)
) stands, together with Formosa ([Taiwan](https://www.britannica.com/place/Taiwan)
) and the [Pescadores (P’eng-hu) Islands](https://www.britannica.com/place/Peng-hu-Islands)
, and agreed to pay a heavy indemnity.

This display of Japanese power and its decisive victory over China threatened to close the door on Russia in East Asia, and it made conflict between Russia and Japan inevitable. In 1896 Russia concluded an alliance with China against Japan, guaranteeing the [integrity](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/integrity)
 of Chinese territory. Russia thus entered into the occupation of the Kwantung Peninsula, from which only three years earlier it had excluded Japan.

Among the Russian commanders at Port Arthur there was serious disagreement. Russia agreed to evacuate southern Manchuria, which was restored to China, and Japan’s control of Korea was recognized.

Russia, China Simulate Attack on Enemy Submarine in Sea of Japan Drills
=======================================================================

Russia and China wrapped up their joint exercise – dubbed Maritime Interaction 2025 by Russia and Joint Sea 2025 by China – Aug. Image via PLAN media

The Russian Navy and People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) simulated attacks on an adversarial submarine and an amphibious ship, and rehearsed a submarine rescue during a recent five-day joint exercise in the Sea of Japan.

A Russian Navy IL-38 and PLAN Y-8 maritime patrol aircraft located and destroyed a simulated enemy submarine in a joint anti-submarine warfare drill in the Sea of Japan, the Russian Ministry of Defense said Wednesday. The two countries also conducted joint firing exercises, using naval guns to fire at a naval target meant to imitate an enemy assault landing ship detachment.

Russia and China wrapped up their joint exercise – dubbed [Maritime Interaction 2025 by Russia and Joint Sea 2025 by China](https://news.usni.org/2025/08/01/chinese-submarine-makes-first-visit-to-russia-for-joint-drills)
 – on Tuesday following several days of drills. The crew of _Volkhov_ simulated evacuating personnel from the submarine.

Following the completion of the drill between _Volkhov_ and _Xihu_, _Igor Belousov_ carried out a similar exercise with the PLAN submarine, according to the release.

“Russian rescue sailors shared their experience with their Chinese colleagues, demonstrating the capabilities of modern medical equipment, pressure chambers and an AS-40 deep-sea rescue submersible vehicle,” the Russian Ministry of Defense said.

CNS _Shaoxing_ and _Qiandaohu_ carried out a separate set of activities in the Sea of Japan. In both cases, fleet oiler JS _Towada_ (AOE-422) and a Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force P-3C Orion MPA shadowed the PLAN ships, according to the JSO release.

Three Russian ships – including a Udaloy-class destroyer, a Ropucha-class tank landing ship, and a Steregushchiy-class frigate – were sighted Saturday sailing east approximately 43 miles northwest of Rebun Island, which lies 31 miles west of Japan’s main island of Hokkaido.

The ships transited east through La Pérouse Strait, which separates Hokkaido from Russia’s Sakhalin Island, to enter the Sea of Okhotsk. La Pérouse Strait is an international waterway and a regular transit route for Russian Navy ships moving between the Sea of Japan and the Sea of Okhotsk.

JMSDF fast attack craft JS _Wakataka_ (PG-825) conducted surveillance on the Russian ships, according to the JSO release.

The three Russian ships are likely part of the Russian Pacific fleet detachment, which includes destroyer RFS _Admiral Panteleyev_ (548), corvette RFS _Sovershennyy_, amphibious landing ship RFS _Oslyabya_ (066), submarine RFS _Magadan_ (B-602) and rescue tug _Alatau_.

The Russian Pacific fleet is conducting a patriotic and information deployment campaign called “Strength in Truth-2025.” As part of the campaign, the four ships and a submarine are expected to sail to various ports in the Russian Far East to commemorate Russia’s role in World War II, and the activities of Russian Pacific Fleet personnel in the Ukraine conflict.

_Admiral Panteleyev, Sovershennyy, Oslyabya_ and _Magadan_ left Vladivostok on Monday for the deployment. <image:2528>](https://news.usni.org/2025/08/05/army-deploys-hypersonic-missiles-to-indo-pacific-for-australian-drills)

China and Russia have begun joint naval drills in the Sea of Japan as they seek to reinforce their partnership and counterbalance what they see as a United States-led global order.

The Chinese and Russian governments have [deepened](/video/newsfeed/2025/5/8/president-xi-china-and-russia-should-safeguard-international-justice)
 their ties in recent years, with China providing an economic lifeline to Russia in the face of Western sanctions over Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.

The Joint Sea-2025 exercises began in waters near the Russian port of Vladivostok and will last for three days, China’s Ministry of National Defence said in a statement on Sunday.

The two sides will hold “submarine rescue, joint anti-submarine, air defence and anti-missile operations, and maritime combat”.

Four Chinese vessels, including guided-missile destroyers Shaoxing and Urumqi, are participating in the exercises, alongside Russian ships, the ministry said.

After the drills, the two countries will conduct naval patrols in “relevant waters of the Pacific”.

China and Russia have carried out annual drills for several years, with the “Joint Sea” exercises beginning in 2012.

Last year’s drills were held along China’s southern coast.

With this year’s drills in the Sea of Japan, in its annual report last month, Japan’s Ministry of Defence warned that China’s growing military cooperation with Russia poses serious security concerns.

“The exercise is defensive in nature and is not directed against other countries,” the Russian Navy Pacific Fleet said earlier this week, according to a report by the US Naval Institute’s online news and analysis portal.

On Friday, the Chinese Defence Ministry said this year’s exercises were aimed at “further deepening the comprehensive strategic partnership” of the two countries.

China has never denounced Russia’s more than three-year [war](/video/newsfeed/2025/8/3/ukraine-claims-drone-strike-on-oil-refinery-in-russia)
 nor called for it to withdraw its troops, and many of Ukraine’s allies, including the US, believe that Beijing has provided support to Moscow.

European leaders asked China last month to use its influence to pressure Russia to end the war, now in its fourth year, but there was no sign that Beijing would do so.

China, however, insists it is a neutral party, regularly calling for an end to the fighting while also accusing Western countries of prolonging the conflict by arming Ukraine.

 met with the Japanese Ambassador, reiterated the PRC's position of sovereignty over the islands, and stating that the two countries should shelve the dispute and look for opportunities to jointly develop resources in the area.[\[75\]](#cite_note-:Wang-75)
: 259  On 30 October 1990, the PRC and Japan stopped disputing the lighthouse issue.[\[75\]](#cite_note-:Wang-75)

Claim: "China and Japan plan to invade the Russian Federation."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Soviet Union invaded Manchuria in August 1945, defeating the Japanese Kwantung Army, which led to the collapse of Japanese puppet states and the return of Manchuria and Inner Mongolia to China. The invasion also involved Mongolia and resulted in the capture of Japanese forces and looting by Soviet troops. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_invasion_of_Manchuria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_invasion_of_Manchuria)) History.com published an article discussing the Soviet Union's declaration of war on Japan on August 8, 1945, and the subsequent invasion of Manchuria the following day <image:i>. ([https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/august-8/soviets-declare-war-on-japan-invade-manchuria](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/august-8/soviets-declare-war-on-japan-invade-manchuria))

The Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905) between Japan and Russia, fought over dominance in Korea and Manchuria, resulted in Japan's victory, becoming the first Asian power to defeat a European power. <image:2464> ([https://www.britannica.com/event/Russo-Japanese-War](https://www.britannica.com/event/Russo-Japanese-War))


## Elaboration
The evidence provides historical context regarding conflicts between Russia, China, and Japan. Specifically, it mentions the Soviet invasion of Manchuria in 1945, which led to the return of Manchuria and Inner Mongolia to China ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_invasion_of_Manchuria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_invasion_of_Manchuria), [https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/august-8/soviets-declare-war-on-japan-invade-manchuria](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/august-8/soviets-declare-war-on-japan-invade-manchuria)). It also highlights the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905), where Japan defeated Russia ([https://www.britannica.com/event/Russo-Japanese-War](https://www.britannica.com/event/Russo-Japanese-War)).

The evidence does not support the claim that China and Japan currently plan to invade the Russian Federation. The provided sources only describe historical events.

To verify the claim, information about current geopolitical relations and any existing plans or intentions of China and Japan regarding Russia would be needed.

Expansion of NATO—or, as its advocates now prefer to term it, NATO enlargement—is the most important international issue on the agenda today. The “regional cooperation” section of the April 1996 U.S.-Japan Joint Declaration on Security did nothing more than list in general terms common regional security goals regarding Korea, China, Russia, and Southeast Asia. Any restrictions on the freedoms of speech, press, or organization after July 1 could touch off a crisis in Sino-American relations, especially if the strictures involved the visible suppression of political protest.

In addition, China’s trade surplus with the United States, at least as measured by official American statistics, will probably exceed Japan’s trade surplus with the United States this year. In line with our [values and policies](/about-us/research-independence-and-integrity-policies/)

!People take part in a protest against the Israeli government, demanding the release of all hostages, amid the ongoing conflict in Gaza between Israel and Hamas, outside the Israeli consulate in New York City, U.S. Moreover, we could facilitate that reluctant acceptance by rhetorical reassurances and various steps to assuage hurt Russian feelings by elaborating cooperative relations between NATO and Russia.

Opposition to expansion of NATO is, regrettably, the one thing on which virtually all Russian political figures can agree. But proceeding on the present track may be even more destabilizing.

The present course now includes an attempt to negotiate a NATO-Russian “charter” or other agreement, offering a yet undefined security relationship short of Russian membership in NATO. Above all, we should keep in mind that the objective is broader and deeper security, not expanding an organization for some at the cost of diminishing security for all.

**JAPAN**

**by Mike Mochizuki**

The post-World War II security relationship between Japan and the United States was based on a bargain inspired by the Soviet threat: the United States agreed to defend Japan in exchange for access to military bases in Japan. Since the Cold War’s end, Washington and Tokyo have been inching toward updating that paternalistic relationship not only to make it more reciprocal but also to expand its focus to include regional peace and stability.

Domestic pressures in both Japan and the United States argue for redefining the alliance. Washington and Tokyo must broaden the discussion to the coordination of diplomacy and economic policy to nurture a more benign regional environment.

**A New Consensus at Home**

Transforming the U.S.-Japan security relationship into a true alliance will require first of all forging a new domestic consensus in both Japan and the United States.

Recent trends in Japan present an opportunity to mobilize political support for a more activist security policy."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The new evidence indicates that China and Russia have been conducting joint military drills in the Sea of Japan since 2012 ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/5/23/china-russia-hold-joint-naval-drills-in-sea-of-japan](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/5/23/china-russia-hold-joint-naval-drills-in-sea-of-japan)).

The evidence suggests a complex geopolitical situation where China and Russia are cooperating militarily, while Japan views this with concern. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that China and Japan plan to invade the Russian Federation.

The evidence does not support the claim that John Thune blocked Adam Schiff's committee assignments. The provided sources mention committee assignments for the 119th and 118th Congresses, with Schiff being assigned to committees. The evidence does not mention any blocking by Thune. The AP article mentions Schiff's role in the Russia investigation, but it does not link this to any blocking of committee assignments.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The article from ACEC.org discusses the Senate committee assignments for the 119th Congress, mentioning that Senator Adam Schiff (D-CA) was assigned to the Finance Committee and that Senate Republican Leader John Thune (R-SD) and Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) announced the committee assignments. [<image:2574>] and [<image:1>] The document from torreydc.com lists the Senate Committee Assignments for the 119th Congress, with Adam Schiff (D-CA) assigned to several committees and John Thune (R-SD) assigned to others; it does not mention any blocking of committee assignments. The document from hklaw.com lists the committee assignments for the House of Representatives and the Senate for the 118th Congress.

### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-ap-top-news-ca-state-wire-adam-schiff-politics-3eec3ea9be5c07a9c297bad439f8f3e8): 
Content: The Associated Press published an article about Adam Schiff, mentioning his role as the lead impeachment prosecutor against Donald Trump. <image:i> The article states that Schiff has been a frequent target of conservatives since the then GOP-led House Intelligence Committee started investigating Trump’s ties to Russia in the 2016 election.


## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim that John Thune blocked Adam Schiff's committee assignments. The provided sources mention committee assignments for the 119th and 118th Congresses, with Schiff being assigned to committees. The evidence does not mention any blocking by Thune. The AP article mentions Schiff's role in the Russia investigation, but it does not link this to any blocking of committee assignments.

To verify the claim, information is missing about whether Thune had the power to block Schiff's assignments and whether he actually did so. Also, it is missing whether the reason for blocking was Schiff's past work in the Russia investigation.

From [Source](https://www.deseret.com/utah/2024/12/23/senate-committee-assignments-119th-congress/): 
Content: "Mike Lee will now have influence over important energy-related policies as chair of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.

Lee will also be joined on one of his committee assignments by freshman Sen.-elect John Curtis.

Late last week, incoming Senate Majority leader John Thune, R-S.D., released the list of GOP Senate committee assignments for the 119th Congress.

According to the [press release](https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=35D445C9-906D-4766-B50E-75E53D511A31)
 from Thune’s office, “The assignments have been ratified by the Senate Republican Conference and are expected to be ratified by the full Senate early next Congress.”

As the Senate changes from a Democratic to a Republican majority, major changes are being made in leadership and committee assignments.

“Seniority broadly dictates which Republicans are in line for these top posts, although they are technically voted on by the committee membership and then that is ratified by the full Republican conference and on the Senate floor,” according to [CNN.](https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/08/politics/gop-senate-committees-new-congress/index.html)

[Government shutdown avoided, Sens. Lee and Curtis be on?

Lee, who is in his third term in the Senate, will serve as the chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, according to a post from the senator on [X.](https://x.com/SenMikeLee/status/1870523447098675336)

This position will “give him power over key issues important to his home state of Utah and a front-row seat to set energy policies that Republicans plan to champion in the next Congress,” according to [CNN.](https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/08/politics/gop-senate-committees-new-congress/index.html)

He will also sit on the Senate Judiciary, Foreign Relations and Budget committees.

“It is an honor to serve the people of Utah,” Lee wrote on [X](https://x.com/SenMikeLee/status/1870523447098675336)
 in regards to his committee assignments.

Curtis will join Lee on the Foreign Relations Committee, according to the [press release](https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=35D445C9-906D-4766-B50E-75E53D511A31)
 from Thune’s office.

Curtis will also sit on the Senate Environment and Public Works, Commerce, and Small Business committees.

“Tackling inflation, unlocking American energy, combatting global instability, and supporting small businesses are priorities Utahns have asked me to address,” Curtis said, according to a press release from his office. Mike Crapo will serve as the chairman of the Finance Committee, per the [press release.](https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=35D445C9-906D-4766-B50E-75E53D511A31)

Crapo will also sit on the Senate Banking; Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions; Judiciary; and Aging and Budget committees.

Idaho’s other senator, Jim Risch, will be the chair of the Foreign Relations Committee, which Lee and Curtis are both on.

According to Thune’s press release, Risch has also been assigned to sit on the Senate Energy, Intel, Small Business, and Ethics committees.

### Other notable committee assignments

Two other outspoken and well-known Republican senators, Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, have been named as the chairs of powerful committees.

“Cruz, Lee and Paul have often railed against Senate GOP leadership — and committee chairs — over government funding, deficit spending and other hot-button issues,“ according to CNN. [Utah](https://www.deseret.com/utah/)

 The next morning on Twitter, Trump called Schiff "Sleazy Adam Schiff, the totally biased Congressman looking into 'Russia'" and called the Russian collusion investigation "the Dem loss excuse".[\[85\]](#cite_note-85)
 Schiff responded on Twitter that the president's "comments and actions are beneath the dignity of the office".[\[86\]](#cite_note-86)

In December 2018, Schiff suggested that Trump associate [Roger Stone](/wiki/Roger_Stone "Roger Stone")
 might have lied to Congress, and said the transcript of his testimony should be forwarded to the Special Counsel.[\[87\]](#cite_note-87)
 In November 2019, Stone was convicted of lying to Congress.[\[88\]](#cite_note-88)

When he became chair of the House Intelligence Committee in 2019, Schiff embarked on a personal mission to investigate Trump's connections to Russia, separate from the Special Counsel investigation.[\[89\]](#cite_note-89)
 He came under fire when he demurred when asked if he would accept it if the Special Counsel's investigation concluded that Trump had not colluded with Russia, saying that he had great confidence in Mueller but that "there may be, for example, evidence of collusion or conspiracy that is clear and convincing, but not proof beyond a reasonable doubt", as is needed for a criminal conviction.[\[90\]](#cite_note-90)

On March 28, 2019, the nine Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee officially called for Schiff to resign due to his allegations that Trump's campaign colluded with Russians in the 2016 election.[\[91\]](#cite_note-91)
 Schiff responded by accusing the Republican members of tolerating "immoral" and "corrupt" conduct by Trump campaign members and administration appointees.[\[92\]](#cite_note-92)

### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-ap-top-news-ca-state-wire-adam-schiff-politics-3eec3ea9be5c07a9c297bad439f8f3e8): 
Content: The Associated Press published an article about Adam Schiff, mentioning his role as the lead impeachment prosecutor against Donald Trump. <image:i> The article states that Schiff has been a frequent target of conservatives since the then GOP-led House Intelligence Committee started investigating Trump’s ties to Russia in the 2016 election.


## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim that John Thune blocked Adam Schiff's committee assignments. The provided sources mention committee assignments for the 119th and 118th Congresses, with Schiff being assigned to committees. The evidence does not mention any blocking by Thune. The AP article mentions Schiff's role in the Russia investigation, but it does not link this to any blocking of committee assignments.

To verify the claim, information is missing about whether Thune had the power to block Schiff's assignments and whether he actually did so. Also, it is missing whether the reason for blocking was Schiff's past work in the Russia investigation.

**Armed Forces Day**, known also as the **Feast of the Polish Armed Forces** ([Polish](/wiki/Polish_language "Polish language")
: _Święto Wojska Polskiego_), is a national holiday celebrated annually on 15 August in Poland, commemorating the anniversary of the 1920 victory over [Soviet Russia](/wiki/Russian_Soviet_Federative_Socialist_Republic "Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic")
 at the [Battle of Warsaw](/wiki/Battle_of_Warsaw_(1920) "Battle of Warsaw (1920)")
 during the [Polish–Soviet War](/wiki/Polish%E2%80%93Soviet_War "Polish–Soviet War")
.[\[1\]](#cite_note-PolskieRadio2013-1)
 Armed Forces Day is held in conjunction with the [Day of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary](/wiki/Assumption_of_Mary "Assumption of Mary")
, itself a separate public holiday.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Kontakt24-2)
 The event is marked by [military parades](/wiki/Military_parade "Military parade")
, equipment reviews, showcases and remembrances by all branches of the [Polish Armed Forces](/wiki/Polish_Armed_Forces "Polish Armed Forces")
 across the country. To commemorate the republic's victory over the Red Army, Minister of Military Affairs [Stanisław Szeptycki](/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Szeptycki "Stanisław Szeptycki")
 established the Feast of the Soldier (_Święta Żołnierza_), or Soldiers Day, in 1923.[\[4\]](#cite_note-4)
 In proclaiming the holiday, Szeptycki declared that, "\[o\]n the anniversary of the memorable defeat of the Bolshevik onslaught on Warsaw, we honor the memory of those killed in battles with enemies throughout all ages and for Polish independence."[\[5\]](#cite_note-Museum-5)
 The date of 15 August was chosen as it coincided with the [21st Mountain Division's](/wiki/21st_Mountain_Infantry_Division_(Poland) "21st Mountain Infantry Division (Poland)")
 evening counterattack on Russian troops, eventually forcing the Red Army's general retreat.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Kontakt24-2)
 Additionally, the government of the Second Republic desired the military's greater integration with the new state, as well as for the armed forces to improve its image among the civilian public.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Kontakt24-2)

The Feast of the Soldier remained a celebrated holiday until 1947, when the newly installed communist government of the [People's Republic of Poland](/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_Poland "People's Republic of Poland")
 discontinued the tradition.[\[6\]](#cite_note-Gazeta2013-6)
 In 1950, the [Council of Ministers](/wiki/Cabinet_of_Poland "Cabinet of Poland")
 under Prime Minister [Józef Cyrankiewicz](/wiki/J%C3%B3zef_Cyrankiewicz "Józef Cyrankiewicz")
 passed regulations to officially celebrate the military on 12 October.[\[7\]](#cite_note-DzU1950-7)
 Renaming the celebration as Polish Armed Forces Day (_Dzień Wojska Polskiego_), the day marked the anniversary of the Soviet-organized [Polish 1st Tadeusz Kościuszko Infantry Division](/wiki/Polish_1st_Tadeusz_Ko%C5%9Bciuszko_Infantry_Division "Polish 1st Tadeusz Kościuszko Infantry Division")
 engaging [German](/wiki/Nazi_Germany "Nazi Germany")
 units at the [Battle of Lenino](/wiki/Battle_of_Lenino "Battle of Lenino")
 in October 1943.[\[7\]](#cite_note-DzU1950-7)
 The communist government found it impossible to celebrate the original date of 15 August and its coinciding historical significance, owing to its glorification of the [Red Army](/wiki/Red_Army "Red Army")
's defeat.[\[8\]](#cite_note-PolskieRadio2012-8)
 Following the return of democracy in the wake of the [events of 1989](/wiki/Revolutions_of_1989 "Revolutions of 1989")
, the [Sejm](/wiki/Sejm "Sejm")
 approved the restoration of Armed Forces Day to the original 15 August date and meaning on 30 July 1992, repealing the earlier communist era 1950 declaration.[\[9\]](#cite_note-Sejm1992-9)

This year’s parade on August 15 will be an expression of "strength, agency and unity" in the face of "threats from the East," Defence Minister Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz has said.

 ![Image:](//static.prsa.pl/images/0cef8818-5db9-4622-ab61-65537c098870.jpg)Image: Polish Ministry of Defence/gov.pl

Speaking during a rehearsal ahead of the Armed Forces Day parade in Warsaw, Kosiniak-Kamysz encouraged the public to celebrate the anniversary of Poland's "great victory" over the Russian Bolsheviks at the 1920 Battle of Warsaw.

"Our presence will be an expression of gratitude to past generations and hope for future ones," he said.

"It will also show our strength, agency and unity in the face of threats from the East," he added.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that Poland held a military parade on August 15, 2024, as part of Armed Forces Day celebrations. The parade was a showcase of military equipment, including tanks. The parade was part of a four-day celebration that started on August 14.

The claim states the image shows a military parade on August 14, 2024, preparing for war with Russia. The evidence confirms a parade took place on August 15, 2024, and the celebrations started on August 14. The evidence does not mention the parade being a preparation for war with Russia.

Therefore, the claim is partially accurate regarding the date and the nature of the event but lacks evidence to support the claim that it was preparing for war with Russia.

Some open-source estimates suggest that Ukraine had already lost nearly 40 Leopards, but those estimates are unconfirmed so far, according to the report. Russia repeatedly stated that arms supplies to Ukraine hinder the settlement and directly involve NATO countries in the conflict. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that the United States and NATO were directly involved in the conflict not only by providing weapons but also by training Ukrainian personnel in European countries.

Ukrainian Armed Forces destroyed in the Zaporozhye direction. Russian Defence Ministry / TASS

Moscow said Tuesday that it had captured several German Leopard tanks and U.S. Bradley infantry fighting vehicles, releasing footage showing Russian troops surveying the equipment supplied to Ukraine by Western countries.

"Leopard tanks and Bradley infantry fighting vehicles. These are our trophies. Equipment of the Ukrainian armed forces in the Zaporizhzhia region," the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement.

"Servicemen of the Vostok group inspect enemy tanks and infantry fighting vehicles captured in battle."

Kyiv has appealed to its allies in the West to deliver a broad range of modern military equipment to help Ukrainian forces recapture large swathes of territory controlled by Russian forces.

The Defense Ministry said several of the captured vehicles had working engines, suggesting that the battles they were involved in had been short and that Ukrainian troops had "fled" their offensive positions.

**(DEFENCE SECURITY ASIA) — During the week of May 11 to 17, Russian military claimed to have successfully destroyed five Leopard 2A1 tanks, manufactured by the German company Krauss-Maffei but donated to the Ukrainian Armed Forces to help the Eastern Europe country in its armed conflict with Russia.**

**In addition to the Leopard tanks, the Russian Ministry of Defense also alleged that 13 armored vehicles, 55 various vehicles, “Grad” multiple rocket launcher systems, and 47 artillery units—22 of which were supplied by foreign countries—were destroyed during this period.**

**Moreover, four Mi-24 helicopters and 40 unmanned boats belonging to the Ukrainian military were reportedly destroyed by Russia in the same timeframe.**

**Among the foreign-supplied armored vehicles to Ukraine, the Leopard tanks have been the most frequently supplied to Kyiv compared to other models such as the American-made Abrams and the British-made Challengers.**

**Since last year, countries such as Germany and several other European nations have supplied between 100-200 Leopard tanks to Ukraine for use in a spring counteroffensive against Russian positions.**

**“Russian Soldiers Pose in Front of Captured Leopard 2A6 Tank”**

**Line of Leopard tanks and Bradley armoured infantry fighting vehicle were destroyed in Zaphorizia, southern Ukraine.**

**Although the Ukrainian counteroffensive in 2023 initially started well, it faced increasingly formidable opposition from Russian forces who began altering their tactics and strategies.**

**These changes in strategy and tactics by the Russian forces led to the destruction of many of the Ukrainian tanks that had been supplied by donor countries like Germany, other European nations, the United States, and Britain.**

**However, to date, no one knows exactly how many Leopard tanks have been destroyed by Russia.**

**Nevertheless, Russian President Vladimir Putin has reportedly stated to his country’s war correspondents that Ukraine has lost more than 160 tanks supplied by foreign countries.**

**Given the high volume of Leopard tanks supplied to Ukraine, it is logical to conclude that many of the tanks destroyed by Russia were Leopard models.**

**Regarding the Abrams tanks, the Russian military stated that of the 31 American-made tanks supplied to Ukraine, more than five of the tanks have been destroyed by Russian forces.**

**A charred M1A1 Abrams main battle tank being transported to Moscow to participate in an exhibition at Victory Park.**

 **As a result of the destruction of five Abrams tanks, the United States has reportedly “withdrawn” these tanks from the Ukrainian battlefield, likely in an effort to “preserve its reputation.”**

**Following the destruction experienced by Leopard tanks supplied by Germany and other European countries, Ukraine’s Deputy Foreign Minister Andii Melnyk has requested that Kiev be supplied with more Leopard tanks, including the latest variant, the Leopard 2A6.**

 **However, the newest Leopard 2A6 variant supplied to Ukraine has met the same fate.**

**The Russian military reported capturing the most powerful tank in the Ukrainian arsenal, the German-made Leopard 2A6, after intense fighting in Avdiivka, Ukraine, last April.**

**It is believed that Ukraine possesses 21 Leopard 2A6 tanks, with 18 of these tanks developed by the companies Krauss-Maffei Wegmann and Rheinmetall being donated by Germany, while the remainder were provided by Portugal.**

**However, most of these Leopard 2A6 tanks donated to the Ukrainian military could not be used after failing to be properly maintained and remained inoperable as claimed by a senior German politician last January.**

**An Abrams tank caught fire after being struck by a Lancet kamikaze drone and an RPG from Russian forces.**

**According to Russian military sources, after capturing and removing the tank from the combat area, Russian forces transported the tank and sent it to Moscow, possibly for research purposes.**

**The Leopard 2A6 was successfully captured after a Russian platoon executed an ambush that caused the Ukrainian tank crew to abandon the German-made vehicle.**

**The Leopard 2A6 represents an upgrade from the Leopard 2A5, incorporating enhanced armor protection, firepower, and electronic warfare capabilities.**

**The tank measures 9.97 meters in length and weighs 62.3 tons, making it one of the heaviest main battle tanks ever deployed, with an engine power of 1,500 horsepower.**

**Capable of speeds up to 75 km/h and with an operational range of 500 km, it is equipped with a Rheinmetall 120 mm L/55 cannon, allowing it to fire all standard NATO ammunition types, including APFSDS, HEAT, and multi-purpose shells.**

**The Leopard 2A6 also features dual 7.62 mm MG3A1 machine guns and an advanced fire control system including a laser rangefinder, thermal imaging, and a ballistic computer. — DSA**

 A Russian academic with close ties to senior Russian diplomats said that Putin probably lost interest in further talks in Qatar because the "Russian leadership usually does not make any compromises under pressure" and attacks on energy infrastructure are highly effective tactics that do more damage to Ukraine than to Russia, adding that Russia is more interested in talks with Ukraine about a broader ceasefire.[\[306\]](#cite_note-washingtonpost-qatar-308)

Volodymyr said it was possible to travel on that road relatively safely a month ago. On 13 March, Russia said the situation in Kursk was "fully under our control" and that Ukraine had "abandoned" much of its material.

What now for Ukraine's offensive?
---------------------------------

Ukraine's top general, Oleksandr Syrskyi, insists that Ukrainian forces have pulled back to "more favourable positions", remain in Kursk, and would do so "for as long as it is expedient and necessary".

He said Russia had suffered more than 50,000 losses during the operation - including those killed, injured or captured.

However, the situation now is very different to last August. <image:4578>!Getty Images A Ukrainian soldier comforts a comrade during fighting in Kursk <image:4579>Getty Images

Ukrainian soldiers fighting in Russia's Kursk region have described scenes "like a horror movie" as they retreated from the front lines.

The BBC has received extensive accounts from Ukrainian troops, who recount a "catastrophic" withdrawal in the face of heavy fire, and columns of military equipment destroyed and constant attacks from swarms of Russian drones.

The soldiers, who spoke over social media, were given aliases to protect their identity. But this again came as a surprise to our command."

At the time of writing, just before Russia retook Sudzha, Volodymyr said Ukrainian forces were being pressed from three sides.

Maksym: Vehicle wrecks litter the roads
---------------------------------------

By 11 March, Ukrainian forces were battling to prevent the road being cut, according to Telegram messages from "Maksym".

"A few days ago, we received an order to leave the defence lines in an organised retreat," he said, adding that Russia had amassed a significant force to retake the town, "including large numbers of North Korean soldiers".

Military experts estimate Russia had amassed a force of up to 70,000 troops to retake Kursk – including about 12,000 North Koreans.

Russia had also sent its best drone units to the front and was using kamikaze and first-person-view (FPV) variants to "take fire control of the main logistics routes".

They included drones linked to operators by fibre-optic wires - which are impossible to jam with electronic counter-measures.

Maksym said as a result "the enemy managed to destroy dozens of units of equipment", and that wrecks had "created congestion on supply routes".

! They were some of their best-trained soldiers, equipped with Western-supplied weapons including tanks and armoured vehicles.

Russian bloggers published videos showing some of that equipment being destroyed or captured. Military analysts estimate two-thirds of the 1,000 sq km gained at the outset have since been lost.

Any hopes that Ukraine would be able to trade Kursk territory for some of its own have significantly diminished.

Last week, President Volodymyr Zelensky said he believed the Kursk operation had "accomplished its task" by forcing Russia to pull troops from the east and relieve pressure on Pokrovsk.

But it is not yet clear at what cost.

No effect on the Pokrovsk front
-------------------------------

There was also increasing evidence that Moscow was having trouble stopping the Ukrainian counterinvasion in Kursk and was increasingly tapping elite units to do so.

Russian military reporters and geolocated footage have revealed that elements of the 810th and 155th naval infantry brigades, the 11th Airborne Brigade, and the 51st and 56th airborne regiments were redeployed to fight in Kursk.

The 810th and 155th naval infantry brigades had been fighting in Kharkiv, where Russia launched a new incursion in May. Sarantsev admitted that the Kursk action had had no effect on the Pokrovsk front.

Ukraine’s deep strikes against Russian military targets and its three-week-old ground offensive inside Russian territory have appeared to be yielding military and political results during the past week.

Russia was reported to be moving its aircraft back from airfields near the Ukrainian border while glide bomb attacks inside Ukraine were reported to have decreased. Life has the same value everywhere.”

Zelenskyy said he had discussed such a joint aerial defence with Lithuanian Prime Minister Ingrid Shimonite and Polish President Andrej Duda in Kyiv on August 24.

Taking the fight to Russia
--------------------------

While Ukraine seeks expanded authority and cooperation from its allies, it is also going its own way. It is believed prototypes of this missile may have been used against Russian-occupied Crimea in August 2023 to [destroy two S-400](/news/2024/2/12/for-ukraines-defence-industry-ambitions-the-skys-the-limit)
 air defence systems. Evidence that Moscow was scrambling elite units from Ukraine to defend home turf also mounted during the week.

An unnamed White House official told the Politico news website that “90 percent of the planes that launch glide bombs” against Ukrainian front-line positions had been moved back inside Russia.

![INTERACTIVE-ATTACK_ON_KURSK_AUG_28-1724833592](/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/INTERACTIVE-ATTACK_ON_KURSK_AUG_20-1724833592.png?w=770&resize=770%2C962&quality=80)

(Al Jazeera)

The independent analysis website Frontelligence agreed that “between the second half of June and mid-July, Russian forces relocated many valuable assets away from the Ukrainian border,” including planes and helicopters.

Ukrainian Colonel Vitaly Sarantsev told a joint news telethon broadcast by Ukrainian channels that the Kursk offensive had greatly reduced Russia’s use of aviation against northeastern Ukraine.

“We felt relief in tactical aviation,” he said on Sunday. If so, that would be a significant proportion of the more than 700,000 soldiers Russia is estimated to have in Ukraine.

The Washington, DC-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a think tank, estimated that Russia would need 60,000 soldiers to win back territory in Kursk once Ukrainian defences were dug. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy last week said it was a preemptive defence to prevent another Kharkiv-type invasion in the north.

But he also told Ukrainians it was “a way to compensate for the deficit in long-range capabilities”.

For months, Zelenskyy has implored the United States to allow Ukraine to use the [ATACMS long-range rocket artillery](/news/2024/8/23/which-countries-weapons-is-ukraine-using-in-russia-incursion)
 it provides to strike airfields deep inside Russia. He also wants the US to release Britain and France, for whose Storm Shadow missiles the US provides components, to authorise their use in the same way.

Currently, the US allows Ukraine to use its weapons to counter battery fire within a limited range across the border but not to hit Russian airfields because it is afraid that this could draw the US into the war.

![INTERACTIVE-WHO CONTROLS WHAT IN SOUTHERN UKRAINE-1724833604](/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/INTERACTIVE-WHO-CONTROLS-WHAT-IN-SOUTHERN-UKRAINE-1724833604.png?w=770&resize=770%2C770&quality=80)

(Al Jazeera)

In a recent analysis, the ISW identified that “at least 209 of 245 (more than 85 percent) known Russian military objects in range of ATACMS are not air bases” but ammunition depots, communications centres, army bases and command centres.

White House national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters on Monday that restrictions on the use of long-range weapons remain in place but “we’ll keep the conversations with the Ukrainians going” to potentially revise them.

The European Commission, which does not command military assets, has openly supported a lifting of restrictions.

The European Union’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, [repeated that support](/news/2024/8/29/eus-borrell-urges-ukraine-backers-to-lift-curbs-on-arms-use-inside-russia)
 on Monday and Thursday. “I reiterate that lifting restrictions on the use of capabilities against the Russian military involved in aggression against Ukraine, in accordance with international law, would strengthen Ukrainian self-defence, save lives and reduce destruction in Ukraine,” he said on Monday.

Russian officials bared their teeth against any such decision and hit out against the fact that both Brussels and Washington have allowed the use of US and European equipment in Ukraine’s Kursk offensive.

“The West does not want to avoid escalation."
