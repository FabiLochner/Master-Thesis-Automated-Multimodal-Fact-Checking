The article states that the North Carolina National Guard has completed 146 flight missions, resulting in the rescue of 538 people and 150 pets.

Content: The search result from Yahoo News, published by Fox News, discusses a claim that Biden said no more aid would be provided for areas affected by Hurricane Helene. The article states that Biden announced a new $8 billion military aid package for Ukraine on Sept. 29. The article also mentions a White House transcript of the exchange and a statement from a White House spokesperson. The article includes a link to a PolitiFact fact-check debunking the claim. <image:4243>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/05/biden-urges-congress-helene-relief-funds): 
Content: The Guardian published an article on October 5, 2024, discussing the White House's response to claims about Hurricane Helene and relief aid. The article mentions that the White House is urging Congress to pass a disaster-relief package. The article states that Biden viewed the damage and cleanup efforts in the Carolinas, Florida, and Georgia. <image:4247> The article also mentions that the SBA will run out of funding in a matter of weeks.

The claim 'In remarks to reporters on September 29, 2024 US President Joe Biden announced that no more aid would be provided for the areas affected by Hurrican Helene, but 2.4 billion US-$ more for Ukraine.' is false.
Justification: The claim is likely false. A Yahoo News article, referencing a PolitiFact fact-check, debunks the assertion that Biden announced no further aid for Hurricane Helene victims while simultaneously allocating funds to Ukraine. Furthermore, The Guardian reported on the White House's efforts to secure disaster relief, contradicting the claim.

So, the overall veracity is: false
