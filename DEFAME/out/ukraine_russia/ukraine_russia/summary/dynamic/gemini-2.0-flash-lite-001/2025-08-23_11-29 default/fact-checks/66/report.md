## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Soviet Union invaded Manchuria in August 1945, defeating the Japanese Kwantung Army, which led to the collapse of Japanese puppet states and the return of Manchuria and Inner Mongolia to China. The invasion also involved Mongolia and resulted in the capture of Japanese forces and looting by Soviet troops. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_invasion_of_Manchuria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_invasion_of_Manchuria)) History.com published an article discussing the Soviet Union's declaration of war on Japan on August 8, 1945, and the subsequent invasion of Manchuria the following day <image:i>.

The Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905) between Japan and Russia, fought over dominance in Korea and Manchuria, resulted in Japan's victory, becoming the first Asian power to defeat a European power. ![image 2464](media/2025-08-07_20-38-1754599112-853183.jpg) ([https://www.britannica.com/event/Russo-Japanese-War](https://www.britannica.com/event/Russo-Japanese-War))


## Elaboration
The evidence provides historical context regarding conflicts between Russia, China, and Japan. Specifically, it mentions the Soviet invasion of Manchuria in 1945, which led to the return of Manchuria and Inner Mongolia to China ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_invasion_of_Manchuria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_invasion_of_Manchuria), [https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/august-8/soviets-declare-war-on-japan-invade-manchuria](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/august-8/soviets-declare-war-on-japan-invade-manchuria)). It also highlights the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905), where Japan defeated Russia ([https://www.britannica.com/event/Russo-Japanese-War](https://www.britannica.com/event/Russo-Japanese-War)).

The evidence does not support the claim that China and Japan currently plan to invade the Russian Federation. The provided sources only describe historical events.

To verify the claim, information about current geopolitical relations and any existing plans or intentions of China and Japan regarding Russia would be needed.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://news.usni.org/2025/08/06/russia-china-simulate-attack-on-enemy-submarine-in-sea-of-japan-drills): 
Content: The search result from USNI News, published on August 6, 2025, discusses joint military drills between Russia and China in the Sea of Japan. The drills included joint maneuvers, air defense, anti-ship operations, and submarine attack simulations. <image:i>. The article also mentions the presence of Japanese ships monitoring the drills.


### Evidence from `web_search`
Al Jazeera reported on joint naval drills between China and Russia in the Sea of Japan, which have been held annually since 2012 (<image:i>, ![image 2464](media/2025-08-07_20-38-1754599112-853183.jpg)). Japan's Ministry of Defence has expressed security concerns about the growing military cooperation between China and Russia.

A Wikipedia article on Chinaâ€“Japan relations discusses diplomatic, economic, and historical ties, including Japan's condemnation of China's cooperation with Russia and territorial disputes over the Senkaku Islands (<image:i>). A Brookings article from 1997 discusses the security relationship between Japan and the United States and regional security goals regarding Korea, China, Russia, and Southeast Asia.


## Elaboration
The new evidence indicates that China and Russia have been conducting joint military drills in the Sea of Japan since 2012 ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/5/23/china-russia-hold-joint-naval-drills-in-sea-of-japan](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/5/23/china-russia-hold-joint-naval-drills-in-sea-of-japan)). Japan has expressed security concerns about this growing military cooperation. The drills include joint maneuvers, air defense, anti-ship operations, and submarine attack simulations ([https://news.usni.org/2025/08/06/russia-china-simulate-attack-on-enemy-submarine-in-sea-of-japan-drills](https://news.usni.org/2025/08/06/russia-china-simulate-attack-on-enemy-submarine-in-sea-of-japan-drills)).

The evidence suggests a complex geopolitical situation where China and Russia are cooperating militarily, while Japan views this with concern. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that China and Japan plan to invade the Russian Federation.


## Final Judgement
The evidence reveals historical conflicts and current geopolitical dynamics between China, Japan, and Russia. While China and Russia conduct joint military drills, and Japan expresses security concerns, there is no evidence to support the claim that China and Japan plan to invade Russia.
