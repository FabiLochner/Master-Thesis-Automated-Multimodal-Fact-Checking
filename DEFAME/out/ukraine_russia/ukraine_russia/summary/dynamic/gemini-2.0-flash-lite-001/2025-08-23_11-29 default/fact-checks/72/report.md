## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Pete Hegseth called Putin a "war criminal" on Fox News in March 2022. The evidence also shows that Roger Wicker stated that Pete Hegseth called Putin a "war criminal who needs to be in prison for the rest of his life." The Kyiv Independent reported that Pete Hegseth identified Russia as the aggressor in the war.

The claim is about Pete Hegseth, but the evidence does not mention that he is the US Secretary of Defense.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that Pete Hegseth called Putin a "war criminal." However, the claim also states that Pete Hegseth is the US Secretary of Defense, which is not supported by the evidence.
