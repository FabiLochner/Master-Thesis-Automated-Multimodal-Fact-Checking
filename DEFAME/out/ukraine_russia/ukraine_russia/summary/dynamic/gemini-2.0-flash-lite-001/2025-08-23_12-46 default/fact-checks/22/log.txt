Useful result: From [Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-says-russia-tries-accuse-it-false-war-crimes-kursk-2024-08-12/): 
Content: Reuters published an article on August 12, 2024, stating that the SBU (Ukraine's State Security Service) said Russia was trying to falsely accuse Kyiv's military of war crimes. The article mentions that Alexei Smirnov, acting governor of the Kursk region, was quoted by Russian state media as saying that Ukrainian forces had used shells containing chemical weapons. Reuters could not independently verify the claim. The article also includes an image <image:1908>
Useful result: From [Source](https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-bolstered-by-north-korean-troops-presses-attacks-in-kursk-region/33243288.html): 
Content: The RFE/RL article, published on December 17, 2024, reports on Russia's intensified offensive in the Kursk region, with the involvement of North Korean troops. <image:1909> The article does not mention any chemical attacks.

The claim '<image:12> This image shows a chemical attack by the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the Kursk offensive in August 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim that the image depicts a chemical attack by the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the Kursk offensive in August 2024 is not supported by the evidence. While there are reports of accusations of chemical weapons use in the region, including claims by Russia against Ukraine, these claims are not independently verified, and the image's origin and context remain unconfirmed. The Reuters article ([https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/sbu-says-russia-trying-falsely-accuse-kyiv-war-crimes-2024-08-12/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/sbu-says-russia-trying-falsely-accuse-kyiv-war-crimes-2024-08-12/)) mentions the accusations, but the claim cannot be verified.

So, the overall veracity is: false
