## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image of destroyed tanks (![image 26](media/78.jpg)) appears in multiple sources. One source, from Sputnik Africa, published on October 17, 2024, reports that Ukraine has lost around 40 Leopard tanks since February 2022. The Moscow Times published an article on June 13, 2023, stating that Russia had captured German Leopard tanks in the Zaporizhzhia region. Defence Security Asia published an article on May 19, 2024, discussing the destruction of German-made Leopard tanks in Ukraine.

The sources do not mention any Ukrainian incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024.


### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results discuss the 2024 Kursk offensive, which began on August 6, 2024, as part of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The Ukrainian military launched an incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast. The article mentions the involvement of Ukrainian brigades, Russian forces, and North Korean forces. The article also mentions the capture of territory, casualties, and the response from Russian authorities, including the declaration of a state of emergency. The article also includes images of damaged buildings and a captured tank. (![image 26](media/78.jpg)) is not mentioned in the search result.

Reuters reported on August 26, 2024, that Russia claimed Ukraine lost 73 tanks, 61 armored personnel carriers, and 404 armored combat vehicles in the Kursk region. The article also includes an image of a crossing point on the border with Russia in the Sumy region.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that there was a Ukrainian incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024. The search results mention the involvement of Ukrainian brigades, Russian forces, and North Korean forces. Reuters reported that Russia claimed Ukraine lost 73 tanks in the Kursk region. However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that the image shows destroyed Ukrainian tanks during the incursion.

The reverse image search results do not provide any information about the context of the image. The web search results mention the Kursk offensive and the loss of tanks but do not directly link the image to the event.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported. While the incursion and tank losses are confirmed, the evidence does not directly link the image to the event. More information is needed to verify the claim fully.


## Actions

```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The image search results include articles about the Kursk offensive in August 2024. The articles from CEPA, Al Jazeera, and NBC News include images of tanks (![image 2790](media/2025-08-07_21-17-1754601438-265144.jpg), ![image 2791](media/2025-08-07_21-17-1754601438-603296.jpg), ![image 2792](media/2025-08-07_21-17-1754601438-877348.jpg)).


## Elaboration
The image search results provide additional context. While the search results include images of tanks, they do not include the specific image in the claim. Therefore, the claim remains unverified. The evidence confirms the incursion and tank losses but does not directly link the image to the event.


## Actions
```
image_search("destroyed tanks Ukraine Russia war")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The image search results include articles about destroyed tanks in the Russia-Ukraine war. CNN published an article on April 27, 2022, about destroyed tanks (![image 4885](media/2025-08-23_13-13-1755954790-188672.jpg)

## Elaboration
The claim is still unverified. While the evidence confirms the Ukrainian incursion into the Kursk Oblast in August 2024 and the presence of destroyed tanks in the Russia-Ukraine war, none of the image searches returned the specific image in the claim. Therefore, there is no direct evidence to support the claim that the image shows destroyed Ukrainian tanks during the incursion.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms the Ukrainian incursion into the Kursk Oblast in August 2024 and the presence of destroyed tanks in the Russia-Ukraine war. However, none of the image searches returned the specific image in the claim. Therefore, there is no direct evidence to support the claim that the image shows destroyed Ukrainian tanks during the incursion.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is unverified. While the evidence confirms a Ukrainian incursion into the Kursk Oblast in August 2024 and the presence of destroyed tanks in the Russia-Ukraine war, the image in question was not found in any of the image searches. Therefore, there is no direct evidence to support the claim that the image shows destroyed Ukrainian tanks during the incursion.
