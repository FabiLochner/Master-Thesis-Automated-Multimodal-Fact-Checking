Useful result: From [Source](https://www.csis.org/analysis/russias-battlefield-woes-ukraine): 
Content: According to a CSIS article published on June 3, 2025, there were as many as 250,000 Russian fatalities in Ukraine between February 2022 and May 2025, with over 950,000 total Russian casualties. <image:4824>, <image:4825>, <image:4826>. The article also mentions that the daily average of Russian casualties has increased every year since 2022.

The claim 'As of February 2025, Russia has lost 1.5 million troops in the Ukraine war.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not supported by the evidence. While a British Army official estimated 1.5 to 1.8 million casualties by July 2024, a [CSIS article](https://www.csis.org/analysis/russias-battlefield-woes-ukraine) from June 3, 2025, estimates over 950,000 total Russian casualties between February 2022 and May 2025, including approximately 250,000 fatalities.

So, the overall veracity is: false
