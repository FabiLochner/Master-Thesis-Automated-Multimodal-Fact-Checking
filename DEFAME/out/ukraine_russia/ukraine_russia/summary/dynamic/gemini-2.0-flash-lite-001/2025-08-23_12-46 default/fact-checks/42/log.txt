Useful result: From [Source](https://www.csis.org/analysis/where-missing-100-billion-us-aid-ukraine): 
Content: The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) published an analysis discussing the controversy surrounding U.S. aid to Ukraine. The article states that in an interview with the Associated Press on February 2, Zelenskyy said Ukraine received $76 billion out of $177 billion in aid. Zelenskyy's statement led to questions about where the "missing" $100 billion went, with accusations of corruption and malfeasance. The article explains that most of the aid is spent in the United States, and the "missing" money is not actually missing. <image:2135>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-trumps-attacks-on-zelenskyy-and-ukraine-aid/a-71702392): 
Content: DW's Fact Check team addresses claims made by Donald Trump regarding Ukraine and Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The article, published on DW.com, fact-checks Trump's statements, including the claim that Zelenskyy is a dictator, which is deemed false. It also addresses Trump's claim that the US has spent $350 billion on Ukraine, which is labeled as "unproven." The article cites the US government's Ukraine oversight working group, stating the US contribution to Ukraine aid totals $203 billion. The article also mentions a poll conducted by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology in early February 2025, which found that Zelenskyy "retains a fairly high level of public trust." The article also mentions that a significant part of the aid consists of paying US soldiers to train Ukrainian troops, or in sending weapons, ammunition and other military equipment from US stocks. <image:k>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.voanews.com/a/false-russian-allegations-that-ukraine-stole-100-billion-of-us-funds/7967072.html): 
Content: The Voice of America published an article on February 7, 2025, debunking Russian allegations that Ukraine stole $100 billion of U.S. funds. The article states that in an interview with the Associated Press, Zelenskyy said Ukraine received $76 billion in military assistance from the U.S. The article also mentions that Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy chairman of the Security Council of Russia, claimed Zelenskyy admitted to embezzling $100 billion. The article further explains that the U.S. has provided $175 billion in aid, with a significant portion spent in the U.S. to build weapons. <image:2137>

The claim 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's statement in an AP news interview from February 1, 2025 that his country's military has received only a portion of the more than 175 billion in U.S. aid confirms that the US aid is a money laundering operation.' is false.
Justification: In a February 1, 2025, AP interview, Zelenskyy stated that Ukraine received only a portion of the U.S. aid, with sources citing around $76 billion received out of a total of $177-200 billion. While this statement is confirmed by multiple sources, including [Izvestia](https://iz.ru/en/1832571/2025-02-02/zelensky-says-he-unaware-200-bln-us-aid-ukraine), [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/21/us-president-trumps-claims-about-zelenskyy-and-ukraine-fact-checked), and [Pravda.com.ua](https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2025/02/2/7496431/), the evidence does not support the claim that this confirms the aid is a money laundering operation.

So, the overall veracity is: false
