Useful result: From [Source](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/menasource/houthi-strikes-on-us-mq9-reaper-drones/): 
Content: The Atlantic Council reports that the Houthis shot down a US MQ-9 Reaper drone over Yemen on December 28, 2024. The Houthis claimed to have shot down a second US-made drone in the Marib governorate in 2025. The article mentions that the Houthis have claimed responsibility for downing fourteen MQ-9 Reaper drones since November 2023. The article also mentions that Iran mediated talks between Russia and the Houthis that led to Moscow supplying Russian-made advanced anti-ship cruise missiles to the group.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/25/nx-s1-5377192/houthis-reaper-drones-us-military-yemen): 
Content: NPR reports that Houthi rebels in Yemen have shot down seven U.S. Reaper drones in recent weeks. The article was published on April 25, 2025, and was written by The Associated Press. <image:20>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/25/politics/houthis-target-drones-hampering-trump-mission): 
Content: The CNN article, published on April 25, 2025, discusses the Houthis' successful targeting of US drones, hindering the US military campaign in Yemen. The article mentions that the Houthis have shot down at least seven multi-million-dollar American drones. <image:i>. The US launched a major military campaign against the Houthi rebel group in Yemen on March 15. The article also mentions that the US has hit over 700 targets and launched more than 300 airstrikes since the campaign began.

The claim '<image:20> This image shows a US drone which was shot down in March 2025 by the Houthis using Russian missiles.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not supported by the evidence. While the Houthis have shot down US drones, as reported by the [Atlantic Council](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/menasource/houthi-strikes-on-us-mq9-reaper-drones/), [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/25/nx-s1-5377192/houthis-reaper-drones-us-military-yemen), and [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/25/politics/houthis-target-drones-hampering-trump-mission), the image's origin and context are not verified. The image's location is most likely in Israel.

So, the overall veracity is: false
