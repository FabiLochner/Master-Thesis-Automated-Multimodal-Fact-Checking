Useful result: From [Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1d4r9yvqzpo): 
Content: The BBC article, published on March 1, 2025, discusses the criticism of Zelensky's clothing choices, specifically his preference for military-style attire over suits, and how it became a point of contention during a White House meeting with Donald Trump and JD Vance. <image:4662>, <image:4665>.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/20/european-leaders-scramble-to-shield-ukraine-in-high-stakes-trump-talks-but-did-they): 
Content: The Guardian published an article on August 20, 2025, discussing a meeting between European leaders, Zelenskyy, and Trump. The article mentions a meeting in Washington and includes a photograph of Trump and Zelenskyy. <image:4667> The article does not mention leaders taking off their suits.

The claim '<image:9> This is an authentic image of world leaders taking off their suits to symbolically support Ukraine at the London summit on Ukraine on March 2, 2025.' is false.
Justification: The claim is unsupported. While the existence of the London Summit on Ukraine on March 2, 2025, is confirmed by multiple sources, including Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_London_Summit_on_Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_London_Summit_on_Ukraine)), there is no evidence to support the assertion that leaders took off their suits at the summit.

So, the overall veracity is: false
