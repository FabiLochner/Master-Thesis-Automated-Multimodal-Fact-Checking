## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Pete Hegseth called Putin a "war criminal." Newsweek published a fact check confirming this statement. Additionally, POLITICO reported that Roger Wicker mentioned Hegseth's statement about Putin being a war criminal. However, the claim states that Hegseth is the US Secretary of Defense, which is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that Pete Hegseth called Putin a "war criminal." However, the claim incorrectly identifies Hegseth as the US Secretary of Defense.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
Pete Hegseth, not the US Secretary of Defense, did call Putin a "war criminal," as confirmed by a Newsweek fact check ([https://www.newsweek.com/pete-hegseth-vladimir-putin-war-criminal-1985251](https://www.newsweek.com/pete-hegseth-vladimir-putin-war-criminal-1985251)).
