Useful result: From [Source](https://www.newsweek.com/alex-jones-claims-killed-infowars-reporter-jamie-white-ukraine-hit-list-2043418): 
Content: Newsweek reports that Alex Jones claimed that Jamie White was on a Ukrainian "hit list".

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.stopfake.org/en/fake-infowars-journalist-murdered-shortly-after-ukraine-put-him-on-their-kill-list/): 
Content: The search result from StopFake.org states that there is no evidence that Jamie White was on any "list of enemies of Ukraine". It also mentions that White was murdered in Austin on March 9, and his sister believes his death was unrelated to his journalistic activities. The search result includes a screenshot of a post from White's X account claiming he was on a Ukrainian "Enemies List" <image:2108>. The article also mentions that law enforcement officials believe White was shot while catching perpetrators trying to steal his car.

The claim 'After InfoWars reporter Jamie White was shot dead on March 10, 2025 in Austin, Texas, it was revelaed that he was on a Ukranian enemies hit list.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While Jamie White was shot and killed in Austin, Texas, on March 9, 2025, the evidence indicates the shooting was related to a car robbery, not a Ukrainian "hit list." Although Alex Jones made this claim, it is unsupported by evidence, and law enforcement's investigation points to a different motive.

So, the overall veracity is: false
