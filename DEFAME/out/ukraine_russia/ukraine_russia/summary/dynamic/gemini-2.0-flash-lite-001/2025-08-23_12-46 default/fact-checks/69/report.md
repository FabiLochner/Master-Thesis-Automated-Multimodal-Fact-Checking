The AOL article fact-checks the claim that the image shows Bashar al-Assad's Russian passport and states that the image is fake and photoshopped. The original passport image was found on Wikipedia. The Wikipedia article discusses Bashar al-Assad's presidency, including the Russian intervention in 2015, and mentions the 2024 Syrian opposition offensives and the fall of Damascus. The NV.ua article discusses the arrest of relatives of Bashar al-Assad at Beirut airport on December 28, who were attempting to leave using fake passports, and mentions that Bashar Assad's regime had fallen and that he fled Damascus.
