Content: PolitiFact, published by PBS NewsHour on March 2, 2025, fact-checks claims made by Trump and Vance regarding Zelenskyy. The fact-check states that Vance claimed Zelenskyy campaigned for the opposition in Pennsylvania in October, which is incorrect. The fact-check mentions Zelenskyy's meeting with Trump in New York on September 27, 2024, and his visit to a Scranton ammunition plant. House Speaker Mike Johnson criticized Zelenskyy's Pennsylvania visit, and House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer launched an investigation into the use of an Air Force plane to fly Zelenskyy to the event. The article also mentions that Zelenskyy met with Pennsylvania Gov. Shapiro and other Democrats at the Scranton ammunition plant. <image:4735>

The claim 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy engaged in election interference by campaigning in Pennsylvania for Kamala Harris ahead of the US presidential election in 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not definitively supported. While Zelenskyy visited a munitions factory in Pennsylvania, and some Republicans viewed this as a signal of support for Kamala Harris, there is no direct evidence of Zelenskyy explicitly campaigning for Harris. Furthermore, an investigation was opened into the visit, but the nature of the visit and any explicit campaigning by Zelenskyy is not detailed.

So, the overall veracity is: false
