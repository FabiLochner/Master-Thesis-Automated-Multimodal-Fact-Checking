Useful result: From [Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/with-no-ukraine-peace-deal-trump-again-threatens-russia-sanctions-2025-08-22/): 
Content: The Reuters article, published on August 22, 2025, discusses the ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia. It mentions that President Trump threatened sanctions on Russia if there is no progress toward a peaceful settlement in Ukraine. The article also mentions a meeting between Trump and Putin in Alaska on August 15, 2025, where arrangements for a Putin-Zelenskiy meeting were discussed. The article states that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Russia was doing everything it could to prevent a meeting between him and Putin. <image:i>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8zdezm507o): 
Content: The BBC published an article one day ago discussing the EU's top diplomat's warning against pushing Ukraine to concede territories to Russia as part of a future peace deal. The article mentions that Donald Trump stressed the need for "swapping of territories". Zelensky has said he is willing to meet Putin "in any format", but there is still no sign from Moscow that they "truly intend to engage in substantive negotiations". Trump set a two-week time frame for evaluating peace talks between Russia and Ukraine.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/21/russia-says-ukraine-not-interested-in-long-term-peace): 
Content: Al Jazeera published an article on August 21, 2025, stating that Russia claims Ukraine is not interested in a long-term peace deal. <image:1>. The article mentions that both sides are preparing for further fighting. It also discusses potential security guarantees and a possible meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy.

The claim 'In early 2025, Ukraine and Russia had reached a peace deal in their years-long war.' is false.
Justification: The evidence from multiple news sources, including Reuters, BBC, and Al Jazeera, indicates that the war between Ukraine and Russia was ongoing in August 2025, with no peace deal reached by early 2025. The articles discuss ongoing conflict, potential negotiations, and disagreements between the involved parties, contradicting the claim.

So, the overall veracity is: false
