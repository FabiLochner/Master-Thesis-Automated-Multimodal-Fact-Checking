## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
In February 2025, Reuters published an article where German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock stated that there must be no peace in Ukraine over the heads of Ukrainians and Europeans (<image:k>). The Guardian reported on February 12, 2025, that Baerbock said Ukraineâ€™s interests must be protected in the upcoming negotiations regarding a ceasefire in Ukraine (![image 1007](media/2025-08-06_18-20-1754504425-007992.jpg)). A Wikipedia article mentions that Baerbock said Trump's conduct represented a "new era of ruthlessness" and called on European countries to "defend the rules-based international order" (<image:i>).

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that in February 2025, Annalena Baerbock made statements regarding the situation in Ukraine, including comments on a potential ceasefire and the need to protect Ukraine's interests. The evidence also shows that Baerbock criticized Donald Trump's conduct, referring to it as a "new era of ruthlessness."

However, the provided evidence does not mention Baerbock threatening the US with severing ties. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified based on the available information.

To verify the claim, information about whether Baerbock threatened to sever ties with the US is missing.
