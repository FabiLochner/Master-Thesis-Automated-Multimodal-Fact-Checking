Useful result: From [Source](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/MS.MIL.XPRT.KD?locations=UA): 
Content: The World Bank provides data on arms exports from Ukraine, sourced from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). The data is available at armstransfers.sipri.org/ArmsTransfer. The World Bank's website was last updated in 2025.

The claim 'Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States' is false.
Justification: The claim is unsupported by the evidence. While Ukraine's arms sales decreased in 2023, and it is the world's largest importer of arms, with the U.S. as a major supplier, there is no data to confirm that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. The provided sources, including [tradingeconomics.com](https://tradingeconomics.com/ukraine/weapons-sales) and [SIPRI](https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2025/ukraine-worlds-biggest-arms-importer-united-states-dominance-global-arms-exports-grows-russian), focus on import/export statistics and do not provide the specific information needed to verify the claim.

So, the overall veracity is: false
