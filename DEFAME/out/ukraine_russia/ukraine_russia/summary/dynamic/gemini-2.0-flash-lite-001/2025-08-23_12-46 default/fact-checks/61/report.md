The Economic Times ([https://m.economictimes.com/news/international/world-news/blast-in-one-of-vladimir-putins-official-limousines-triggers-fresh-assassination-concerns/articleshow/119758547.cms](https://m.economictimes.com/news/international/world-news/blast-in-one-of-vladimir-putins-official-limousines-triggers-fresh-assassination-concerns/articleshow/119758547.cms)) reported that one of Vladimir Putin's official limousines exploded in Moscow, raising security concerns. The Kyiv Post ([https://www.kyivpost.com/post/49868](https://www.kyivpost.com/post/49868)) reported that one of Putinâ€™s luxury Aurus limousines caught fire after an explosion near the Federal Security Service (FSB) headquarters in Moscow. GB News ([https://www.gbnews.com/news/world/vladimir-putin-chief-killed-moscow-car-explosion](https://www.gbnews.com/news/world/vladimir-putin-chief-killed-moscow-car-explosion)) published an article about an explosion.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that an explosion occurred involving one of Vladimir Putin's official limousines in Moscow. However, the provided sources do not confirm that Putin was in the limousine at the time of the explosion, nor do they confirm his death.

The articles from The Economic Times ([https://m.economictimes.com/news/international/world-news/blast-in-one-of-vladimir-putins-official-limousines-triggers-fresh-assassination-concerns/articleshow/119758547.cms](https://m.economictimes.com/news/international/world-news/blast-in-one-of-vladimir-putins-official-limousines-triggers-fresh-assassination-concerns/articleshow/119758547.cms)) and The Kyiv Post ([https://www.kyivpost.com/post/49868](https://www.kyivpost.com/post/49868)) focus on the explosion and the security concerns it raised. The GB News article ([https://www.gbnews.com/news/world/vladimir-putin-chief-killed-moscow-car-explosion](https://www.gbnews.com/news/world/vladimir-putin-chief-killed-moscow-car-explosion)) also mentions the explosion.

Therefore, the claim that Putin died in the explosion cannot be verified based on the provided evidence. More information is needed to confirm Putin's presence in the vehicle and his subsequent fate.


## Final Judgement
The search results confirm an explosion involving one of Putin's limousines, but they do not provide any information about Putin's death. The evidence focuses on the explosion itself and the security concerns it raised.

Since the provided evidence does not confirm Putin's death, the claim is not supported. Therefore, the most appropriate decision is `false`.


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is not supported by the evidence. While reports from sources like *The Economic Times* ([https://m.economictimes.com/news/international/world-news/blast-in-one-of-vladimir-putins-official-limousines-triggers-fresh-assassination-concerns/articleshow/119758547.cms](https://m.economictimes.com/news/international/world-news/blast-in-one-of-vladimir-putins-official-limousines-triggers-fresh-assassination-concerns/articleshow/119758547.cms)) and *The Kyiv Post* ([https://www.kyivpost.com/post/49868](https://www.kyivpost.com/post/49868)) confirm an explosion involving one of Putin's limousines, they do not mention Putin's presence in the vehicle or his death.
