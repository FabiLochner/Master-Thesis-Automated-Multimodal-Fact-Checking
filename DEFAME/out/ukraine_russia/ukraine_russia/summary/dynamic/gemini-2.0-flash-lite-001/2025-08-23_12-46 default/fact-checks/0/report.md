The real front page had a different headline.

The fake cover was spread on Telegram channels and other pro-Russian sources. The Journal.ie's article was written by Cormac Fitzgerald. ![image 4597](media/2025-08-23_12-47-1755953227-626059.jpg), ![image 4599](media/2025-08-23_12-47-1755953230-095340.jpg), ![image 4640](media/2025-08-23_12-49-1755953363-467010.jpg), ![image 4642](media/2025-08-23_12-49-1755953366-714202.jpg)
