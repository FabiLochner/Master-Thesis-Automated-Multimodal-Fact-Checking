Useful result: From [Source](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/fact-check-disinformation-spikes-after-trump-zelenskyy-row/articleshow/118774997.cms): 
Content: The Times of India published an article on March 7, 2025, discussing a surge of disinformation targeting Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The article mentions a recent dispute in the Oval Office between Zelenskyy, Donald Trump, and JD Vance. The article also mentions that from February 18 to February 24, 2025, there was a significant increase in social media posts and articles mentioning Zelenskyy alongside terms like "villa," "yacht," "winery," or "mansion." The article does not contain the quote from Zelenskyy in the claim.

Useful result: From [Source](https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-volodymyr-zelenskyy-ukraine-war-troops-883661209159): 
Content: The Associated Press published a fact check article stating that Zelenskyy did not say U.S. troops needed to fight in Ukraine. The article does not mention a meeting between Zelenskyy and Trump in February 2025. The article was published on August 22, 2024.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.voanews.com/a/fact-check-no-zelenskyy-did-not-say-american-sons-and-daughters-will-have-to-die-in-ukraine/6986873.html): 
Content: The Voice of America (VOA) published an article on March 2, 2023, fact-checking a claim that Zelenskyy said the U.S. would have to send its citizens to "fight and die in Ukraine." The article states that the claim is false and that the statement was taken out of context from a press conference on February 24, 2023. The original statement referred to a hypothetical situation where Russia attacks NATO members. <image:4713>

The claim 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the U.S. will have 'to send their sons and daughters' to die for Ukraine after having a heated exchange with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House in February 2025.' is false.
Justification: The claim is demonstrably false. While a meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy occurred in February 2025, there is no evidence to support the specific quote attributed to Zelenskyy. Furthermore, a fact-check from Voice of America ([https://www.voanews.com/a/fact-check-no-zelenskyy-did-not-say-american-sons-and-daughters-will-have-to-die-in-ukraine/6986873.html](https://www.voanews.com/a/fact-check-no-zelenskyy-did-not-say-american-sons-and-daughters-will-have-to-die-in-ukraine/6986873.html)) debunked a similar statement.

So, the overall veracity is: false
