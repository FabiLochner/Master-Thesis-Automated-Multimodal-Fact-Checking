# Instructions
You are provided with the record of a fact-check. It contains the Claim to be verified and a documentation of all the fact-checking work along the gathered evidence. Your task is to **summarize the fact-check**. That is, you provide a concise, one-paragraph justification for the final VERDICT based on the knowledge from the Record. Note:
* Be truthful, brief, do not add any additional information besides the information given in the Record. 
* Link key sources in your summary. Use Markdown notation for that. You may link them in-line.
* Don't state the Claim again. Rather focus on the key insights of the fact-check.
* Simply print just the summary.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:1> This image shows a screenshot of an authentic Hull Daily Mail's frontpage from March 13, 2025 saying '70,000 Ukrainian soldiers in the Kursk region died in vain. The UK poured hundreds of millions of pounds into Zelensky's crushing failure'."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:1>)
```

## Evidence
No new evidence found.

## Elaboration
The provided image is a screenshot of the Hull Daily Mail's front page. The headline states that 70,000 Ukrainian soldiers died in the Kursk region, and it also mentions the UK's financial involvement in what is described as Zelensky's crushing failure.

Without additional information, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of the claims made in the headline. The veracity of the statements about the number of casualties, the location, and the UK's financial involvement cannot be confirmed based solely on the image.


## Actions
```
image_search("Hull Daily Mail front page Ukrainian soldiers Kursk region")
```

## Evidence

사진 한 장이 2022년 러시아의 우크라이나 침공 이후 우크라이나에게 격추당한 러시아 전투기를 촬영한 것이라는 주장과 함께 소셜미디어상에서 반복적으로 공유됐다. 하지만 이 사진은 1993년 영국에서 에어쇼 도중 발생한 사고 현장을 촬영한 것으로, 2022년 러시아의 우크라이나 침공과는 무관하다.

문제의 사진은 2022년 2월 24일 "우크라이나 방공부대에 격추당하는 러시아 전투기"라는 글귀와 함께 [페이스북](https://archive.ph/sJbrs)
에 공유됐다.

문제의 주장이 공유된 페이스북 게시글 스크린샷. 2022년 3월 10일 캡쳐. ( AFP)

해당 사진은 우크라이나 정부군이 2022년 2월 24일 러시아 전투기 5대와 헬기 한 대를 친러시아 반군이 장악한 우크라이나 동부 지역에서 격추했다고 [발표](https://www.deccanherald.com/international/ukraine-claims-downed-five-russian-planes-helicopter-1084634.html)
한 이후부터 온라인상에 공유됐다.

동일한 사진이 유사한 주장과 함께 트위터 [여기](https://archive.ph/i2vgR)
와 [여기](https://archive.ph/7gu4S)
에도 공유됐고, 우크라이나 정부군이 발표한 내용을 보도한 한 국내 온라인 매체의 기사에도 [게시](https://archive.ph/JIuGU)
됐다.

하지만 이 사진은 1993년 영국의 한 에어쇼 도중 촬영된 것으로, 2022년 러시아의 우크라이나 침공과는 무관하다.

### 에어쇼 사고

러시아 포털사이트 얀덱스 역 이미지 검색을 통해 페이스북에 잘못된 주장과 함께 공유된 사진과 일치하는 사진을 항공 사진 데이터베이스 [Air Team Images](https://archive.md/Net24)
에서 찾을 수 있었다.

두 사진 비교를 통해 페이스북에 공유된 사진이 좌우 반전된 것을 알 수 있다.

이 웹사이트는 칼 포드(Carl Ford)라는 인물이 1993년 7월 24일 영국의 페어포드시(Fairford)에서 해당 사진을 촬영했다고 소개하고 있다.

사진에는 "러시아 미그-29 전투기 2대가 충돌한 사고 장면을 촬영한 사진. 사고로 인한 사망자나 심한 부상자는 발생하지 않았다"라는 설명이 붙었다.

다음은 페이스북에 공유된 사진(좌)과 Air Team Images에 게시된 원본 사진(우)을 비교한 것이다.

페이스북에 게시된 사진(좌)과 Air Team Images에 게시된 원본 사진(우) 비교 ( AFP)

해당 사진을 촬영한 포드는 동일한 사진을 2015년 10월 15일 온라인 사진 공유 및 관리 웹사이트 [플리커](https://www.flickr.com/photos/53277566@N06/5520340518/in/photostream/)
에도 게시했는데, 이 사진에도 유사한 설명이 붙었다.

포드는 AFP와 서면 인터뷰에서 "이 사진은 내가 1993년 7월 24일 촬영한 11장의 사진 중 하나다. 촬영에는 니콘 F.3 HP 카메라를 이용했다."라고 말했다.

영국 일간지 인디펜던트(The Independent)는 1993년 7월 26일 자 [기사](https://archive.md/uJxrQ)
를 통해 포드가 촬영한 사진에 등장하는 사고를 보도했는데 이 기사에는 "영국 공군이 이번 주말 열린 세계 최대 규모의 에어쇼에서 발생한 러시아 전투기 공중 충돌 사고의 원인 규명을 위한 조사에 착수했다"라는 내용이 담겨있다.

해당 사고는 1993년 영국 의회가 발표한 [보고서](https://archive.md/U6NNx)
에서도 언급됐다.

An **airliner** is a type of [airplane](/wiki/Airplane "Airplane")
 for transporting [passengers](/wiki/Passenger "Passenger")
 and [air cargo](/wiki/Air_cargo "Air cargo")
. Such aircraft are most often operated by [airlines](/wiki/Airline "Airline")
. The modern and most common variant of the airliner is a long, tube shaped, and [jet powered aircraft](/wiki/Jetliner "Jetliner")
. The largest of them are [wide-body](/wiki/Wide-body_aircraft "Wide-body aircraft")
 jets which are also called twin-aisle because they generally have two separate aisles running from the front to the back of the passenger cabin. These are usually used for [long-haul flights](/wiki/Flight_length#Short-haul_and_long-haul "Flight length")
 between [airline hubs](/wiki/Airline_hub "Airline hub")
 and major cities. A smaller, more common class of airliners is the [narrow-body](/wiki/Narrow-body_aircraft "Narrow-body aircraft")
 or single-aisle. These are generally used for short to medium-distance flights with fewer passengers than their wide-body counterparts.

[Regional airliners](/wiki/Regional_airliner "Regional airliner")
 typically seat fewer than 100 passengers and may be powered by [turbofans](/wiki/Turbofan "Turbofan")
 or [turboprops](/wiki/Turboprop "Turboprop")
. These airliners are the non-[mainline](/wiki/Mainline_(flight) "Mainline (flight)")
 counterparts to the larger aircraft operated by the major carriers, [legacy carriers](/wiki/Legacy_carrier "Legacy carrier")
, and [flag carriers](/wiki/Flag_carrier "Flag carrier")
, and are used to feed traffic into the large airline hubs. These regional routes then form the spokes of a hub-and-spoke air transport model.

The lightest aircraft are short-haul regional feeder airliner type aircraft that carry a small number of passengers are called commuter aircraft, commuterliners, feederliners, and [air taxis](/wiki/Air_taxi "Air taxi")
, depending on their size, engines, how they are marketed, region of the world, and seating configurations. The [Beechcraft 1900](/wiki/Beechcraft_1900 "Beechcraft 1900")
, for example, has only 19 seats.

When the [Wright brothers](/wiki/Wright_brothers "Wright brothers")
 made the world's first sustained [heavier-than-air flight](/wiki/Heavier-than-air_flight "Heavier-than-air flight")

 during 1903,[\[1\]](#cite_note-NewarkDailyAdvocate_19031228-1)

During 1913, [Igor Sikorsky](/wiki/Igor_Sikorsky "Igor Sikorsky")
 developed the first large multi-engine airplane, the [Russky Vityaz](/wiki/Sikorsky_Russky_Vityaz "Sikorsky Russky Vityaz")

[\[5\]](#cite_note-5)
 This aircraft was subsequently refined into the more practical [Ilya Muromets](/wiki/Sikorsky_Ilya_Muromets "Sikorsky Ilya Muromets")
, being furnished with dual controls for a pilot and copilot and a comfortable [cabin](/wiki/Aircraft_cabin "Aircraft cabin")
 with a lavatory, cabin heating and lighting.[\[6\]](#cite_note-ASM0807-6)
 This large four-engine biplane was further adapted into an early [bomber aircraft](/wiki/Bomber_aircraft "Bomber aircraft")
, preceding subsequent transport and bomber aircraft.[\[6\]](#cite_note-ASM0807-6)
 It first flew on 10 December 1913 and took off for its first demonstration flight with 16 passengers aboard on 25 February 1914. However, it was never used as a commercial airliner due to the onset of the [First World War](/wiki/First_World_War "First World War")
 which led to military applications being prioritised.[\[7\]](#cite_note-7)

### Interwar period

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Interwar period")\
\]

In 1919, shortly after the end of the First World War, large numbers of ex-military aircraft flooded the market. One such aircraft was the French [Farman F.60 Goliath](/wiki/Farman_F.60_Goliath "Farman F.60 Goliath")
, which had originally been designed as a long-range [heavy bomber](/wiki/Heavy_bomber "Heavy bomber")
; a number were converted for commercial use into passenger airliners starting in 1919, being able to accommodate a maximum of 14 seated passengers. and around 60 were built. Initially, several publicity flights were made, including one on 8 February 1919, when the Goliath flew 12 passengers from [Toussus-le-Noble](/wiki/Toussus-le-Noble "Toussus-le-Noble")
 to [RAF Kenley](/wiki/RAF_Kenley "RAF Kenley")
, near [Croydon](/wiki/Croydon "Croydon")
, despite having no permission from the British authorities to land. Dozens of early airlines subsequently procured the type.[\[9\]](#cite_note-aeroplane1015-9)
 One high-profile flight, made on 11 August 1919, involved an F.60 flying eight passengers and a ton of supplies from Paris via [Casablanca](/wiki/Casablanca "Casablanca")
 and [Mogador](/wiki/Mogador "Mogador")
 to Koufa, 180 km (110 mi) north of [Saint-Louis, Senegal](/wiki/Saint-Louis,_Senegal "Saint-Louis, Senegal")
, flying more than 4,500 km (2,800 mi).[\[10\]](#cite_note-10)

Another important airliner built in 1919 was the [Airco DH.16](/wiki/Airco_DH.16 "Airco DH.16")
; a redesigned [Airco DH.9A](/wiki/Airco_DH.9A "Airco DH.9A")
 with a wider [fuselage](/wiki/Fuselage "Fuselage")
 to accommodate an enclosed cabin seating four passengers, plus pilot in an open cockpit. In March 1919, the prototype first flew at [Hendon Aerodrome](/wiki/Hendon_Aerodrome "Hendon Aerodrome")
. Nine aircraft were built, all but one being delivered to the nascent airline, [Aircraft Transport and Travel](/wiki/Aircraft_Transport_and_Travel "Aircraft Transport and Travel")
, which used the first aircraft for pleasure flying, and on 25 August 1919, it inaugurated the first scheduled international airline service from London to Paris.[\[11\]](#cite_note-Jackson_Civil_V2_p62-11)
 One aircraft was sold to the River Plate Aviation Company in [Argentina](/wiki/Argentina "Argentina")
, to operate a cross-river service between [Buenos Aires](/wiki/Buenos_Aires "Buenos Aires")
 and [Montevideo](/wiki/Montevideo "Montevideo")
.[\[11\]](#cite_note-Jackson_Civil_V2_p62-11)
 Meanwhile, the competing [Vickers](/wiki/Vickers "Vickers")
 converted its successful First World War era bomber, the [Vickers Vimy](/wiki/Vickers_Vimy "Vickers Vimy")
, into a civilian version, the Vimy Commercial. It was redesigned with a larger-diameter fuselage (largely of [spruce](/wiki/Spruce "Spruce")
 plywood), and first flew from the Joyce Green airfield in [Kent](/wiki/Kent "Kent")
 on 13 April 1919.[\[12\]](#cite_note-Andrews_Vickersp95-12)
[\[13\]](#cite_note-Jackson_v3_p202-13)

The world's first all-metal transport aircraft was the [Junkers F.13](/wiki/Junkers_F.13 "Junkers F.13")
, which also made its first flight in 1919.[\[14\]](#cite_note-14)
 Junkers marketed the aircraft towards business travellers and commercial operators, and European entrepreneurs bought examples for their private use and business trips. Over 300 Junkers F 13s were built between 1919 and 1932.[\[15\]](#cite_note-15)
 The Dutch [Fokker](/wiki/Fokker "Fokker")
 company produced the [Fokker F.II](/wiki/Fokker_F.II "Fokker F.II")
, then the enlarged [F.III](/wiki/Fokker_F.III "Fokker F.III")
.[\[16\]](#cite_note-Flight260521p355-16)
 These were used by the Dutch airline [KLM](/wiki/KLM "KLM")
, including on its Amsterdam-London service in 1921. A relatively reliable aircraft for the era, the Fokkers were flying to destinations across Europe, including Bremen, Brussels, Hamburg, and Paris.[\[17\]](#cite_note-deLeeuw-17)

The [Handley Page](/wiki/Handley_Page "Handley Page")
 company in Britain produced the [Handley Page Type W](/wiki/Handley_Page_Type_W "Handley Page Type W")
, its first civil transport aircraft. It housed two crew in an open [cockpit](/wiki/Cockpit "Cockpit")
 and 15 passengers in an enclosed cabin. Powered by two 450 hp (340 kW) [Napier Lion](/wiki/Napier_Lion "Napier Lion")
 engines, the prototype first flew on 4 December 1919, shortly after it was displayed at the 1919 [Paris Air Show](/wiki/Paris_Air_Show "Paris Air Show")
 at [Le Bourget](/wiki/Le_Bourget "Le Bourget")
. It was ordered by the Belgian firm [Sabena](/wiki/Sabena "Sabena")
, a further ten Type Ws were [produced under license](/wiki/Licensed_production "Licensed production")
 in Belgium by [SABCA](/wiki/SABCA "SABCA")
.[\[18\]](#cite_note-18)
 In 1921 the [Air Ministry](/wiki/Air_Ministry "Air Ministry")
 ordered three aircraft, built as the W.8b, for use by [Handley Page Transport](/wiki/Handley_Page_Transport "Handley Page Transport")
, and later by [Imperial Airways](/wiki/Imperial_Airways "Imperial Airways")
, on services to [Paris](/wiki/Paris "Paris")
 and [Brussels](/wiki/Brussels "Brussels")
.[\[19\]](#cite_note-19)

In France, the [Bleriot-SPAD S.33](/wiki/Bleriot-SPAD_S.33 "Bleriot-SPAD S.33")
 was introduced during the early 1920s.[\[20\]](#cite_note-Flight070721p460-20)
 It was commercially successful, initially serving the Paris-[London](/wiki/London "London")
 route, and later on [continental](/wiki/Europe "Europe")
 routes. The enclosed cabin could carry four passengers with an extra seat in the cockpit. It was further developed into the [Blériot-SPAD S.46](/wiki/Bl%C3%A9riot-SPAD_S.46 "Blériot-SPAD S.46")
. Throughout the 1920s, companies in Britain and France were at the forefront of the civil airliner industry.[\[21\]](#cite_note-21)

By 1921, the capacity of airliners needed to be increased to achieve more favourable economics. The English company [de Havilland](/wiki/De_Havilland "De Havilland")
, built the 10-passenger [DH.29](/wiki/De_Havilland_Doncaster "De Havilland Doncaster")
 monoplane,[\[22\]](#cite_note-Jackson_Civil_V2_pageneeded-22)
 while starting work on the design of the DH.32, an eight-seater [biplane](/wiki/Biplane "Biplane")
 with a more economical but less powerful [Rolls-Royce Eagle](/wiki/Rolls-Royce_Eagle "Rolls-Royce Eagle")
 engine.[\[23\]](#cite_note-Jackson_Civil_V3_508525-23)
 For more capacity, DH.32 development was replaced by the [DH.34](/wiki/De_Havilland_DH.34 "De Havilland DH.34")
 biplane, accommodating 10 passengers.[\[24\]](#cite_note-Flight180823-24)
 A commercially successful aircraft, [Daimler Airway](/wiki/Daimler_Airway "Daimler Airway")
 ordered a batch of nine.[\[22\]](#cite_note-Jackson_Civil_V2_pageneeded-22)

The [Ford Trimotor](/wiki/Ford_Trimotor "Ford Trimotor")
 had two engines mounted on the wings and one in the nose, and a slabsided body, it carried eight passengers and was produced from 1925 to 1933.[\[25\]](#cite_note-Herrick_2004-25)
 It was an important early airliner in America. It was used by the predecessor to [Trans World Airlines](/wiki/Trans_World_Airlines "Trans World Airlines")
, and by other airlines long after production ceased. The Trimotor helped to popularise numerous aspects of modern aviation infrastructure, including paved [runways](/wiki/Runway "Runway")
, [passenger terminals](/wiki/Airport_terminal "Airport terminal")
, [hangars](/wiki/Hangar "Hangar")
, [airmail](/wiki/Airmail "Airmail")

.[\[25\]](#cite_note-Herrick_2004-25)
[\[26\]](#cite_note-26)
 [Pan Am](/wiki/Pan_Am "Pan Am")
 opened up transoceanic service in the late 1920s and early 1930s, based on a series of large seaplanes – the [Sikorsky S-38](/wiki/Sikorsky_S-38 "Sikorsky S-38")
 through [Sikorsky S-42](/wiki/Sikorsky_S-42 "Sikorsky S-42")
.[\[27\]](#cite_note-Johnson-27)
[\[28\]](#cite_note-Daley,_Robert_1980,_page_103-28)

By the 1930s, the airliner industry had matured and large consolidated national airlines were established with regular international services that spanned the globe, including [Imperial Airways](/wiki/Imperial_Airways "Imperial Airways")
 in Britain, [Lufthansa](/wiki/Lufthansa "Lufthansa")
 in Germany, KLM in the Netherlands, and [United Airlines](/wiki/United_Airlines "United Airlines")
 in America. Multi-engined aircraft were now capable of transporting dozens of passengers in comfort.[\[29\]](#cite_note-29)

During the 1930s, the British [de Havilland Dragon](/wiki/De_Havilland_Dragon "De Havilland Dragon")
 emerged as a short-haul, low-capacity airliner. Its relatively simple design could carry six passengers, each with 45 lb (20 kg) of luggage, on the London-Paris route on a fuel consumption of 13 gal (49 L) per hour.[\[30\]](#cite_note-30)
 The DH.84 Dragon entered worldwide service. During early August 1934, one performed the first non-stop flight between the Canadian mainland and Britain in 30 hours 55 minutes, although the intended destination had originally been [Baghdad](/wiki/Baghdad "Baghdad")
 in [Iraq](/wiki/Iraq "Iraq")
.[\[31\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTERiding1980289-31)
[\[32\]](#cite_note-racing_p265-32)
 British production of the Dragon ended in favour of the [de Havilland Dragon Rapide](/wiki/De_Havilland_Dragon_Rapide "De Havilland Dragon Rapide")
, a faster and more comfortable successor.[\[33\]](#cite_note-moss_3-33)

By November 1934, series production of the Dragon Rapide had commenced.[\[34\]](#cite_note-moss_4-34)
 De Havilland invested into advanced features including elongated rear windows, cabin heating, thickened wing tips, and a strengthened airframe for a higher gross weight of 5,500 lb (2,500 kg).[\[35\]](#cite_note-moss_5-35)
 Later aircraft were amongst the first airliners to be fitted with [flaps](/wiki/Flap_(aeronautics) "Flap (aeronautics)")
 for improved landing performance, along with downwards-facing recognition light and metal propellers, which were often retrofitted to older aircraft.[\[36\]](#cite_note-moss_6-36)
 It was also used in military roles;[\[34\]](#cite_note-moss_4-34)

The [Douglas DC-3](/wiki/Douglas_DC-3 "Douglas DC-3")
 appeared in 1935

Metal airliners came into service in the 1930s. In the United States, the [Boeing 247](/wiki/Boeing_247 "Boeing 247")
,[\[38\]](#cite_note-bhistory-38)
 and the 14-passenger [Douglas DC-2](/wiki/Douglas_DC-2 "Douglas DC-2")
,[\[39\]](#cite_note-39)
 flew during the first half of the decade, while the more powerful, faster, 21–32 passenger [Douglas DC-3](/wiki/Douglas_DC-3 "Douglas DC-3")
 first appeared in 1935. DC-3s were produced in quantity for the [Second World War](/wiki/Second_World_War "Second World War")
 and were sold as surplus afterward, becoming widespread within the commercial sector. It was one of first airliners to be profitable without the support of postal or government subsidies.[\[40\]](#cite_note-Mellberg-40)
[\[41\]](#cite_note-41)

Long-haul flights were expanded during the 1930s as Pan American Airways and Imperial Airways competed on [transatlantic travel](/wiki/Transatlantic_flight "Transatlantic flight")
 using fleets of [flying boats](/wiki/Flying_boat "Flying boat")
, such as the British [Short Empire](/wiki/Short_Empire "Short Empire")
 and the American [Boeing 314](/wiki/Boeing_314 "Boeing 314")
.[\[42\]](#cite_note-bogash-42)
 Imperial Airways' order for 28 Empire flying boats was viewed by some as a bold gamble.[\[43\]](#cite_note-norris_3-43)
 At the time, flying boats were the only practical means of building aircraft of such size and weight as land-based aircraft would have unfeasibly poor field performance.[\[43\]](#cite_note-norris_3-43)
 One Boeing 314, [registration NC18602](/wiki/Extended_flight_of_Pan_American_NC18602 "Extended flight of Pan American NC18602")

 British aircraft manufacturers were tied up to fulfill military requirements, and had no free capacity to address other matters though the war.[\[48\]](#cite_note-48)

The committee final report pushed four designs for the state-owned airlines [British Overseas Airways Corporation](/wiki/British_Overseas_Airways_Corporation "British Overseas Airways Corporation")
 (BOAC) and later [British European Airways](/wiki/British_European_Airways "British European Airways")
 (BEA): three piston-powered aircraft of varying sizes, and a [jet-powered](/wiki/Jet_engine "Jet engine")
 100-seat design at the request of [Geoffrey de Havilland](/wiki/Geoffrey_de_Havilland "Geoffrey de Havilland")
, involved in the first jet fighters development.

After a brief contest, the Type I design was given to the [Bristol Aeroplane Company](/wiki/Bristol_Aeroplane_Company "Bristol Aeroplane Company")
, building on a "100 ton [bomber](/wiki/Bomber "Bomber")
" submission.[\[49\]](#cite_note-Barnes324-49)
 This evolved into the [Bristol Brabazon](/wiki/Bristol_Brabazon "Bristol Brabazon")

 engine.[\[50\]](#cite_note-Phipp67-50)

The Type II was split between the [de Havilland Dove](/wiki/De_Havilland_Dove "De Havilland Dove")

 with the latter entering service with BOAC in February 1957, over seven years following its order.[\[55\]](#cite_note-Phipp105-55)

The jet-powered Type IV became the [de Havilland Comet](/wiki/De_Havilland_Comet "De Havilland Comet")
 in 1949. It featured an aerodynamically clean design with four [de Havilland Ghost](/wiki/De_Havilland_Ghost "De Havilland Ghost")

A [Sud-Aviation Caravelle](/wiki/Sud-Aviation_Caravelle "Sud-Aviation Caravelle")

The [Sud-Aviation Caravelle](/wiki/Sud-Aviation_Caravelle "Sud-Aviation Caravelle")
 was developed during the late 1950s as the first short range jet airliner. The nose and cockpit layout were licensed from the [de Havilland Comet](/wiki/De_Havilland_Comet "De Havilland Comet")
, along with some fuselage elements.[\[69\]](#cite_note-López1-69)
 Entering service in mid 1959, 172 Caravelles had been sold within four years and six versions were in production by 1963.[\[70\]](#cite_note-70)
 Sud Aviation then focused its design team on a Caravelle successor.[\[69\]](#cite_note-López1-69)

The [Super-Caravelle](/wiki/Sud_Aviation_Super-Caravelle "Sud Aviation Super-Caravelle")
 was a [supersonic transport](/wiki/Supersonic_transport "Supersonic transport")
 project of similar size and range to the Caravelle. It was merged with the similar [Bristol Aeroplane Company](/wiki/Bristol_Aeroplane_Company "Bristol Aeroplane Company")
 project into the Anglo-French [Concorde](/wiki/Concorde "Concorde")
.[\[69\]](#cite_note-López1-69)
 The Concorde entered service in January 1967 as the second and last commercial [supersonic transport](/wiki/Supersonic_transport "Supersonic transport")

#### USSR

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: USSR")\

Soon after the war, most of the Soviet fleet of airliners consisted of DC-3s or [Lisunov Li-2s](/wiki/Lisunov_Li-2 "Lisunov Li-2")
. These planes were in desperate need of replacement, and in 1946, the [Ilyushin Il-12](/wiki/Ilyushin_Il-12 "Ilyushin Il-12")
 made its first flight. The Il-12 was very similar in design to American Convair 240, except was unpressurized. In 1953, the [Ilyushin Il-14](/wiki/Ilyushin_Il-14 "Ilyushin Il-14")
 made its first flight, and this version was equipped with much more powerful engines. The main contribution that the Soviets made in regards to airliners was the [Antonov An-2](/wiki/Antonov_An-2 "Antonov An-2")
. This plane is a biplane, unlike most of the other airliners, and sold more units than any other transport plane.[\[63\]](#cite_note-Jarrett-63)

Engines
-------

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Engines")\
\]

Until the beginning of the [Jet Age](/wiki/Jet_Age "Jet Age")
, [piston engines](/wiki/Piston_engine "Piston engine")
 were common on [propliners](/wiki/Propliner "Propliner")
 such as the Douglas DC-3. Nearly all modern airliners are now powered by [turbine](/wiki/Gas_turbine "Gas turbine")
 engines, either [turbofans](/wiki/Turbofan "Turbofan")
 or [turboprops](/wiki/Turboprop "Turboprop")
. Gas turbine engines operate efficiently at much higher altitudes, are more reliable than piston engines, and produce less vibration and noise. The use of a common fuel type – kerosene-based jet fuel – is another advantage.

Airliner variants
-----------------

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Airliner variants")\
\]

Some variants of airliners have been developed for carrying freight or for luxury [corporate use](/wiki/Business_jet "Business jet")
. Many airliners have also been modified for government use as [VIP](/wiki/Very_Important_Person "Very Important Person")
 transports and for military functions such as airborne tankers (for example, the [Vickers VC10](/wiki/Vickers_VC10 "Vickers VC10")
, [Lockheed L-1011](/wiki/Lockheed_L-1011 "Lockheed L-1011")
, [Boeing 707](/wiki/Boeing_707 "Boeing 707")
), air ambulance ([USAF](/wiki/United_States_Air_Force "United States Air Force")
/[USN](/wiki/United_States_Navy "United States Navy")
 [McDonnell Douglas DC-9](/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_DC-9 "McDonnell Douglas DC-9")
), [reconnaissance](/wiki/Aerial_reconnaissance "Aerial reconnaissance")
 ([Embraer ERJ 145](/wiki/Embraer_ERJ_145_family "Embraer ERJ 145 family")
, [Saab 340](/wiki/Saab_340 "Saab 340")
, and [Boeing 737](/wiki/Boeing_737 "Boeing 737")
), as well as for troop-carrying roles.

Configuration
-------------

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Configuration")\
\]

Modern jetliners are usually low-wing designs with two engines mounted underneath the [swept wings](/wiki/Swept_wing "Swept wing")
, while [turboprop](/wiki/Turboprop "Turboprop")
 aircraft are slow enough to use straight wings. Smaller airliners sometimes have their engines mounted on either side of the rear fuselage. Numerous advantages and disadvantages exist due to this arrangement.[\[74\]](#cite_note-74)
 Perhaps the most important advantage to mounting the engines under the wings is that the total aircraft weight is more evenly distributed across the wingspan, which imposes less [bending moment](/wiki/Bending_moment "Bending moment")
 on the wings and allows for a lighter wing structure. This factor becomes more important as aircraft weight increases, and no in-production airliners have both a maximum takeoff weight more than 50 tons and engines mounted on the fuselage. The [Antonov An-148](/wiki/Antonov_An-148 "Antonov An-148")
 is the only in-production jetliner with high-mounted wings (usually seen in [military transport aircraft](/wiki/Military_transport_aircraft "Military transport aircraft")
), which reduces the risk of damage from unpaved runways.

Except for a few experimental or military designs, all aircraft built to date have had all of their weight [lifted](/wiki/Lift_(force) "Lift (force)")
 off the ground by airflow across the wings. In terms of [aerodynamics](/wiki/Aerodynamics "Aerodynamics")
, the fuselage has been a mere burden. [NASA](/wiki/NASA "NASA")
 and [Boeing](/wiki/Boeing "Boeing")
 are currently developing a [blended wing body](/wiki/Blended_wing_body "Blended wing body")
 design in which the entire airframe, from wingtip to wingtip, contributes lift. This promises a significant gain in [fuel efficiency](/wiki/Fuel_efficiency_in_transportation "Fuel efficiency in transportation")
.[\[75\]](#cite_note-75)

 since 2008, and strong [airline](/wiki/Airline "Airline")
 passenger demand since.[\[84\]](#cite_note-84)
 In 2004, 718 Airbus and Boeings were delivered, worth $39.3 billion; 1,466 are expected in 2017, worth $104.4 billion: a growth by 3.5 from 2004 to 2020 is unprecedented and highly unusual for any mature market.[\[85\]](#cite_note-85)

| Manufacturer | 2016 orders and deliveries[\[86\]](#cite_note-FGfleetwatch-86) |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| deliveries | values ($bn) | net orders | backlog |
| Boeing | 726 | 57.8 | 563 | 5,660 |

| Other | 31  | 0.5 | 72  | 1,080 |
| Total | 1,704 | 110.1 | 1,583 | 14,702 |

In 2016, the deliveries went for 38% in Asia-Pacific, 25% in Europe, 22% in North America, 7% in Middle East, 6% in South America and 2% in Africa. 1,020 narrowbodies were delivered and their backlog reach 10891: 4,991 A320neo, 644 A320ceo; 3,593 737 Max, 835 737NG, 348 CSeries, 305 C919 and 175 MC-21; while 398 widebodies were delivered : 137 Dreamliners and 99 B777 for Boeing (65%) against 63 A330 and 49 A350 for Airbus, more than 2,400 widebodies were in backlog, led by the A350 with 753 (31%) then the Boeing 787 with 694 (28%).[\[86\]](#cite_note-FGfleetwatch-86)

The most important driver of orders is airline [profitability](/wiki/Profitability "Profitability")

An airliner will usually have several classes of seating: [first class](/wiki/First_class_travel "First class travel")
, [business class](/wiki/Business_class "Business class")
, and/or [economy class](/wiki/Economy_class "Economy class")
 (which may be referred to as coach class or tourist class, and sometimes has a separate "premium" economy section with more legroom and amenities). The seats in more expensive classes are wider, more comfortable, and have more amenities such as "lie flat" seats for more comfortable sleeping on long flights. Generally, the more expensive the class, the better the beverage and meal service.

Domestic flights generally have a two-class configuration, usually first or business class and coach class, although many airlines instead offer all-economy seating. International flights generally have either a two-class configuration or a three-class configuration, depending on the airline, route and aircraft type. Many airliners offer [movies or audio/video](/wiki/In-flight_entertainment "In-flight entertainment")
 on demand (this is standard in first and business class on many international flights and may be available on economy). Cabins of all classes have [lavatory](/wiki/Aircraft_lavatory "Aircraft lavatory")
 facilities, reading lights, and [air vents](/wiki/Environmental_control_system#Air_distribution "Environmental control system")
. Some larger airliners have a [rest compartment](/wiki/Crew_rest_compartment "Crew rest compartment")
 reserved for crew use during breaks.

### Seats

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=24 "Edit section: Seats")\
\]

Main article: [Airline seat](/wiki/Airline_seat "Airline seat")

The types of seats that are provided and how much legroom is given to each passenger are decisions made by the individual airlines, not the aircraft manufacturers. Seats are mounted in "tracks" on the floor of the cabin and can be moved back and forth by the maintenance staff or removed altogether. One driver of airline profitability is how many passengers can be seated in economy class cabins, meaning that airline companies have an incentive to place seats close together to fit as many passengers in as possible.[\[91\]](#cite_note-91)
 In contrast, ‘premium class’ seat configurations provide more space for travelers.[\[92\]](#cite_note-92)

Passengers seated in an **exit row** (the row of seats adjacent to an [emergency exit](/wiki/Emergency_exit "Emergency exit")
) usually have substantially more legroom than those seated in the remainder of the cabin, while the seats directly in front of the exit row may have less legroom and may not even recline (for evacuation safety reasons). However, passengers seated in an exit row may be required to assist cabin crew during an [emergency evacuation](/wiki/Emergency_evacuation "Emergency evacuation")
 of the aircraft opening the emergency exit and assisting fellow passengers to the exit. As a precaution, many airlines prohibit young people under the age of 15 from being seated in the exit row.[\[93\]](#cite_note-93)

The seats are designed to withstand strong forces so as not to break or come loose from their floor tracks during [turbulence](/wiki/Turbulence "Turbulence")
 or accidents. The backs of seats are often equipped with a fold-down tray for eating, writing, or as a place to set up a portable computer, or a music or video player. Seats without another row of seats in front of them have a tray that is either folded into the armrest or that clips into brackets on the underside of the armrests. However, seats in premium cabins generally have trays in the armrests or clip-on trays, regardless of whether there is another row of seats in front of them. Seatbacks now often feature small colour [LCD](/wiki/LCD "LCD")
 screens for videos, television and video games. Controls for this display as well as an outlet to plug in audio headsets are normally found in the armrest of each seat.

### Overhead bins

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=25 "Edit section: Overhead bins")\
\]

Further information: [Overhead storage](/wiki/Overhead_storage "Overhead storage")

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Overhead_bins_%286389156645%29.jpg/250px-Overhead_bins_%286389156645%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:Overhead_bins_(6389156645).jpg)

Overhead bins aboard a [Sukhoi Superjet 100](/wiki/Sukhoi_Superjet_100 "Sukhoi Superjet 100")

The overhead bins, also known as overhead lockers or pivot bins, are used for stowing carry-on baggage and other items. While the airliner manufacturer will normally specify a standard version of the product to supply, airlines can choose to have bins of differing size, shape, or color installed. Over time, overhead bins evolved out of what were originally overhead shelves that were used for little more than coat and briefcase storage. As concerns about falling debris during turbulence or in accidents increased, enclosed bins became\[_[when?](/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers#Chronological_items "Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers")\
_\] the norm. Bins have increased in size to accommodate the larger carry-on baggage passengers can bring onto the aircraft. Newer bin designs have included a handrail, useful when moving through the cabin.[\[94\]](#cite_note-94)

### Passenger service units

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=26 "Edit section: Passenger service units")\
\]

Above the passenger seats are [Passenger Service Units](/wiki/Passenger_Service_Unit "Passenger Service Unit")
 (PSU). These typically contain reading lights, air vents, and a flight attendant call light. On most narrowbody aircraft (and some [Airbus A300s](/wiki/Airbus_A300 "Airbus A300")
 and [A310s](/wiki/Airbus_A310 "Airbus A310")
), the flight attendant call button and the buttons to control the reading lights are located directly on the PSU, while on most widebody aircraft, the flight attendant call button and the reading light control buttons are usually part of the [in-flight entertainment](/wiki/In-flight_entertainment "In-flight entertainment")
 system. The units frequently have small "Fasten Seat Belt" and "No Smoking" illuminated signage and may also contain a speaker for the cabin public address system. On some newer aircraft, a "Turn off electronic devices" sign is used instead of the "No Smoking" sign, as smoking isn't permitted on board the aircraft anyway.

The PSU will also normally contain the drop-down [oxygen masks](/wiki/Oxygen_mask "Oxygen mask")
 which are activated if there is a sudden drop in cabin pressure. These are supplied with oxygen by means of a [chemical oxygen generator](/wiki/Chemical_oxygen_generator "Chemical oxygen generator")
. By using a chemical reaction rather than a connection to an oxygen tank, these devices supply breathing oxygen for long enough for the airliner to descend to thicker, more breathable air. Oxygen generators do generate considerable heat in the process. Because of this, the oxygen generators are thermally shielded and are only allowed in commercial airliners when properly installed – they are not permitted to be loaded as freight on passenger-carrying flights. [ValuJet Flight 592](/wiki/ValuJet_Flight_592 "ValuJet Flight 592")
 crashed on May 11, 1996, as a result of improperly loaded chemical oxygen generators.

### Cabin pressurization

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=27 "Edit section: Cabin pressurization")\
\]

Main article: [Cabin pressurization](/wiki/Cabin_pressurization "Cabin pressurization")

Airliners developed since the 1940s have had pressurized cabins (or, more accurately, pressurized hulls including baggage holds) to enable them to carry passengers safely at high altitudes where low oxygen levels and air pressure would otherwise cause sickness or death. High altitude flight enabled airliners to fly above most weather systems that cause turbulent or dangerous flying conditions, and also to fly faster and further as there is less drag due to the lower air density. Pressurization is applied using compressed air, in most cases bled from the engines, and is managed by an [environmental control system](/wiki/Environmental_control_system "Environmental control system")
 which draws in clean air, and vents stale air out through a valve.

Pressurization presents design and construction challenges to maintain the structural integrity and sealing of the cabin and hull and to prevent [rapid decompression](/wiki/Rapid_decompression "Rapid decompression")
. Some of the consequences include small round windows, [doors that open inwards and are larger than the door hole](/wiki/Plug_door "Plug door")
, and an [emergency oxygen system](/wiki/Emergency_oxygen_system "Emergency oxygen system")
.

To maintain a pressure in the cabin equivalent to an altitude close to sea level would, at a cruising altitude around 10,000 m (33,000 ft), create a pressure difference between inside the aircraft and outside the aircraft that would require greater hull strength and weight. Most people do not suffer ill effects up to an altitude of 1,800–2,500 m (5,900–8,200 ft), and maintaining cabin pressure at this equivalent altitude significantly reduces the pressure difference and therefore the required hull strength and weight. A side effect is that passengers experience some discomfort as the cabin pressure changes during ascent and descent to the majority of airports, which are at low altitudes.

### Cabin climate control

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=28 "Edit section: Cabin climate control")\
\]

The air bled from the engines is hot and requires cooling by [air conditioning](/wiki/Air_conditioning "Air conditioning")
 units. It is also extremely dry at cruising altitude, and this causes sore eyes, dry skin and [mucosa](/wiki/Mucosa "Mucosa")
 on long flights. Although [humidification](/wiki/Humidifier "Humidifier")
 technology could raise its [relative humidity](/wiki/Relative_humidity "Relative humidity")
 to comfortable middle levels, this is not done since humidity promotes [corrosion](/wiki/Corrosion "Corrosion")
 to the inside of the hull and risks [condensation](/wiki/Condensation "Condensation")
 which could [short](/wiki/Short_circuit "Short circuit")
 electrical systems, so for safety reasons it is deliberately kept to a low value, around 10%. Another problem of the air coming from the ventilation (unto which the oil lubrication system of the engines is hooked up) is that fumes from components in the synthetic oils can sometimes travel along, causing passengers, pilots and crew to be intoxicated. The illness it causes is called [aerotoxic syndrome](/wiki/Aerotoxic_syndrome "Aerotoxic syndrome")
.

 on the floor and the partition labeled "Caution: Do Not Hit – Potable Water Tank Inside".

Airliners must have space on board to store "checked" baggage – that which will not safely fit in the passenger cabin.

Designed to hold baggage as well as freight, these compartments are called "cargo bins", "baggage holds", "luggage holds", or occasionally "pits". Occasionally baggage holds may be referred to as **cargo decks** on the largest of aircraft. These compartments can be accessed through doors on the outside of the aircraft.

Depending on the aircraft, baggage holds are normally inside the hull and are therefore pressurized just like the passenger cabin although they may not be heated. While lighting is normally installed for use by the loading crew, typically the compartment is unlit when the door is closed.

Baggage holds on modern airliners are equipped with fire detection equipment and larger aircraft have automated or remotely activated fire-fighting devices installed.

### Narrow-body airliners

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=30 "Edit section: Narrow-body airliners")\
\]

Most "[narrow-body](/wiki/Narrow-body_aircraft "Narrow-body aircraft")
" airliners with more than 100 seats have space below the cabin floor, while smaller aircraft often have a special compartment separate from the passenger area but on the same level.

Baggage is normally stacked within the bin by hand, sorted by destination category. Netting that fits across the width of the bin is secured to limit movement of the bags. Airliners often carry items of [freight](/wiki/Freight "Freight")
 and mail. These may be loaded separately from the baggage or mixed in if they are bound for the same destination. For securing bulky items "hold down" rings are provided to tie items into place.

### Wide-body airliners

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=31 "Edit section: Wide-body airliners")\
\]

"[Wide-body](/wiki/Wide-body_aircraft "Wide-body aircraft")
" airliners frequently have a compartment like the ones described above, typically called a "bulk bin". It is normally used for late arriving luggage or bags which may have been checked at the gate.

However, most baggage and loose freight items are loaded into containers called [Unit Load Devices](/wiki/Unit_Load_Device "Unit Load Device")
 (ULDs), often referred to as "cans". ULDs come in a variety of sizes and shapes, but the most common model is the [LD3](/wiki/LD3 "LD3")
. This particular container has approximately the same height as the cargo compartment and fits across half of its width.

ULDs are loaded with baggage and are transported to the aircraft on [dolly carts](/wiki/Ground_support_equipment#Dollies "Ground support equipment")
 and loaded into the baggage hold by a loader designed for the task. By means of [belts](/wiki/Conveyor_belt "Conveyor belt")
 and [rollers](/w/index.php?title=Roller_(machine_part)&action=edit&redlink=1 "Roller (machine part) (page does not exist)")
 an operator can maneuver the ULD from the dolly cart, up to the aircraft baggage hold door, and into the aircraft. Inside the hold, the floor is also equipped with drive wheels and rollers that an operator inside can use to move the ULD properly into place. Locks in the floor are used to hold the ULD in place during flight.

For consolidated freight loads, like a pallet of boxes or an item too oddly shaped to fit into a container, flat metal pallets that resemble large baking sheets that are compatible with the loading equipment are used.

**Have you ever traveled on a jumbo jet and wondered how people might have traveled by air before its invention?**

The Museum's collection holds a variety of different airplanes which help tell the story of flight. Our collection of commercial aircraft, such as the well-known Boeing 747, help tell the history of America by air. Learn more about some of these aircraft below. 

From the Wright Brothers to Today

The Airplane's Family Tree


------------------------------

Did you know that the parts of airplanes today can be traced directly back to the Wright Flyer and the work of Orville and Wilbur Wright? In this episode of STEM in 30, we trace the family tree of the airplane from that first flight on December 17, 1903, to today—all from inside a United Airlines 76.

Early Commercial Airliners
--------------------------

The story of commercial aviation starts with air mail. Commercial airlines initially struggled to get off the ground, but with help from the government, who awarded airlines contracts to deliver the mail, they soon began to flourish. As technology improved, aircraft evolved from World War I-style biplanes into sleek, high-performance modern airliners.

### Flying the Mail

![America by Air - Curtiss JN-4D Jenny](/sites/default/files/styles/callout_half/public/images/2007-13554h.jpg?h=ed802e08&itok=tWzV7mzM)

The Curtiss JN-4D Jenny


---------------------------

Early airlines were able to turn a profit through contracts with the federal government to fly the mail. Designed as a trainer for the U.S. Army Air Service, the Curtiss JN-4 first flew in 1916. Known popularly as the "Jenny," the JN-4 taught thousands of Allied pilots to fly during World War I. After the war, surplus Jennys were widely used for "barnstorming"—traveling air shows—and they opened the first scheduled air mail service. 

The JN-4D featured a 90-horsepower Curtiss OX-5 engine. The Army ordered Curtiss to convert six JN-4Ds for the U.S. Air Mail Service by installing a larger 150-horsepower Hispano-Suiza engine and a mail compartment. These airplanes were redesignated as JN-4Hs. The Smithsonian acquired this Jenny in 1918.

### Who is Jenny?

The airplane's official name is the Curtiss JN-4. If you say the letters "JN" out loud, they sound like "Jay-En."  
That was shortened to "Jen," and it eventually was changed to "Jenny."

Of the more than 200 pilots hired by the Post Office from 1918 to 1926, 35 died flying the mail. Fatalities dropped after the first few years, but flying the mail remained a dangerous-and sometimes deadly-job.

The Post Office created a series of air mail stamps featuring the Jenny when it began flying the mail. Post Office printers made a mistake when they first printed this stamp. Today very few of these rare "upside-down Jenny" stamps still exist. These famous stamps are worth a lot of money.

De Havilland DH-4


---------------------

By 1921 modified de Havilland DH-4 light bombers were being used as mail planes. They soon become the symbol of the U.S. Air Mail Service. 

The DH-4 in the Museum's collection was the prototype American-built DH-4, manufactured by the Dayton-Wright Airplane Company. This airplane was used in more than 2,600 experiments until its retirement in April 1919. On May 13, 1918, Orville Wright made his last flight as a pilot in a 1911 Wright Model B alongside this DH-4, flown by Howard Max Rinehart. He then made a flight as a passenger in the DH-4 with Rinehart.

### Curtiss Carrier Pigeon

Powered by the venerable Liberty engine, the Curtiss Carrier Pigeon was designed to carry mail along National Air Transport's lucrative New York-Chicago route. Both Curtiss and National were owned by pioneer aviation entrepreneur Clement Keys.

### Flying Passengers

Many [early airlines](https://airandspace.si.edu/stories/editorial/early-airlines-you-might-not-have-heard)
 attempted to make a profitable business from transporting passengers, but every one of these efforts failed due to high operating costs. Even after the government gave private airlines contracts to fly the mail, it was still difficult for airlines to make passenger flight profitable—resulting in [further subsidies](https://airandspace.si.edu/stories/editorial/air-mail-and-birth-commercial-aviation)
 from the federal government to encourage airlines to carry more passengers.

A model of the Benoist Model XIV. The Benoist was powered by a Roberts 75-horsepower, 6-cylinder, water-cooled engine. In 1914, the trip across the bay cost $5—more than $100 today. 

### Benoist Model XIV

Many early airlines utilized flying boats for passenger service. The St. Petersburg-Tampa Airboat Line began flying across Tampa Bay on January 1, 1914. The flight covered 29 kilometers (18 miles) and took 23 minutes—11 hours less than traveling between St. Petersburg and Tampa by rail. The airline purchased a Model XIV from St. Louis aircraft manufacturer Thomas Benoist. The airplane could carry one passenger, who sat next to the pilot in the open cockpit.

Ford Tri-Motor


------------------

Affectionately known as the “Tin Goose,” the Ford Tri-Motor was the largest civil aircraft in America when it first flew on August 2, 1926. Its all-metal, corrugated aluminum construction and the prestigious Ford name made it immediately popular with passengers and airline operators. Noisy but reliable, the Ford Tri-Motor played a major role in convincing the public that air travel was safe and practical.

### Curtiss Condor 

First flown in 1932, the Curtiss Condor could carry 14 passengers and had sleeping berths for night flight. Although comfortable and fast, it was expensive to operate. Eastern Air Transport and American Airways flew the Condor, but newer designs soon replaced it.

A model of the Boeing 40A.

### Boeing 40A

Powered by Pratt & Whitney's Wasp engine, the Boeing 40A could carry two passengers. Thanks to the biplane's large payload capacity and low operating costs, Boeing Air Transport won the coveted air mail route from Chicago to San Francisco in 1927 and operated the route at a profit.

Boeing developed a larger version of the aircraft, the Boeing 40B, which could carry 4,400 kilograms (2,000 pounds) of mail and four passengers. The pilot flew the airplane from an open cockpit behind the passenger compartment.

The First Modern Airliners
--------------------------

With help from the government via air mail contracts and other subsidies, commercial aviation in the United States began to take route. However, the mid-1930s were a difficult time for airlines. The federal government had broken up the large companies that had dominated the aviation industry and had cut its subsidies to airlines. Air transportation regulation was in a state of confusion. Improvements in aircraft and aviation technology played a key role in revitalizing the struggling airline industry.

To survive in these challenging times, airlines needed bigger, better, and faster airplanes that could profitably fly passengers as well as mail. New navigation and communications equipment was also required to enhance safety and efficiency. The aviation industry responded. By the late 1930s, the first modern, high-performance airliners were taking to the air.

![Image of the Boeing 247-D](/sites/default/files/styles/callout_half/public/images/image-albums/Boeing%20247-D.jpg?h=1dd3cf61&itok=wQeo249y)

Boeing 247


--------------

The government provided bonuses to airlines if their aircraft could fly at night or had multiple engines, two-way radios, and other equipment that promoted safety and speed. The first aircraft produced under these terms was the Boeing 247 in 1933, the world's first modern airliner. It could carry 10 passengers, fly 50 percent faster than the Ford Tri-Motor, and cross the country in less than 20 hours. The Boeing 247 revolutionized air transportation, featuring a sleek, low-wing, all-metal construction; retractable landing gear; and supercharged, air-cooled engines. Its innovative design launched a new generation of commercial airliners, notably the Douglas DC-2. The Boeing 247-D, the version in the Museum's collection, pioneered the use of controllable-pitch propellers and wing de-icer boots.

[![Pan Am Martin M-130 China Clipper](/sites/default/files/styles/body_large/public/images/8531_640.jpg?itok=e8WUHXny "Pan Am Martin M-130 China Clipper")](/multimedia-gallery/8531640jpg)

A model of the China Clipper. When the _China Clipper_ opened Pan Am's transpacific air mail route in 1935 and passenger service in 1936, it became one of the most famous airplanes in the world. Pan Am's other flying boats were known as the _Hawaii Clipper_ and the _Philippine Clipper_.

### China Clipper

The _China Clipper_ was the name of one of three Martin M-130 flying boats built for Pan American Airways, the United States' primary international airline during the 1930s. The Martin M-130 was the first airliner that could fly nonstop the 3,840-kilometer (2,400-mile) distance between San Francisco and Honolulu, Hawaii—the longest major route in the world without and emergency intermediate landing field. The _China Clipper_ and its sister ships demonstrated that there were no technological barriers to transoceanic travel.

Boeing 307 Stratoliner


--------------------------

The Boeing 307 Stratoliner was the world's first pressurized airliner. While other airliners flew no higher than about 3,000 meters (10,000 feet), the Stratoliner could cruise at 7,500 meters (25,000 feet). By ascending "above the weather," it could fly faster and more efficiently and provide its 33 passengers a smoother and quieter ride. Because of the onset of World War II and the development of improved designs, only 10 Stratoliners were built. The last one, Pan American's Clipper Flying Cloud, is housed in the Museum's collection.

### Four-Engine Propeller Planes

Aircraft manufacturers introduced a new generation of large, four-engine airliners after World War II that soon dominated U.S. and international air travel and helped lower fares. These new airliners were built with profitable transcontinental air routes in mind. They enabled airlines to carry far more people at greater speeds, while providing unprecedented comfort for passengers and unprecedented profits for airlines. As a result, competition increased and fares fell, thus opening up air travel to even more people.

[![Lockheed Super Constellation L-1049F](/sites/default/files/styles/body_large/public/images/4485h.jpg?itok=IR0qiF20 "Lockheed Super Constellation L-1049F")](/multimedia-gallery/4485hjpg)

The Museum's "Connie" was used by the military. It was retired in 1977 after 21½ years of military service, thousands of flying hours, and countless ocean crossings.

### Lockheed Constellation and Super Constellation

Sleek, powerful, and graceful, TWA's Lockheed Constellations introduced pressurized comfort and shortened transcontinental travel by an astounding five hours. Eastern began flying the "stretched" 71-seat Super Constellation in 1951. The L-1049C and strengthened L-1049G versions had greater range and capacity than the original "Connie." Northwest Orient and TWA also flew Super Constellations.

Douglas DC-7


----------------

The Douglas DC-7 was an advanced development of the DC-6B piston-engine airliner. It was introduced by American Airlines on its New York-Los Angeles route in November 1953 and was the first airliner to provide nonstop transcontinental service in both directions. 

The fastest transport aircraft in service, the DC-7 cruised at 580 kilometers (360 miles) per hour. A total of 338 DC-7s of all types were purchased by 18 different airlines. Like other piston-engine airliners, it was made obsolete by the introduction of turbine-engine Boeing 707s and Douglas DC-8s. Some DC-7s later served as cargo and charter planes. 

This nose section from the Museum's collection is from American Airlines' Flagship Vermont, which carried about 130,000 passengers in its nearly 13,500 hours aloft.

Jet Airliners
-------------

The jet engine revolutionized air travel. Powerful and durable, jets enabled aircraft manufacturers to build bigger, faster, and more productive airliners. Jet technology also enabled airlines to reduce their operating costs and their airfares. Jet passenger service began in the United States in the late 1950s with the introduction of Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8 airliners. 

Jet engines have far fewer moving parts than piston engines, so they are more reliable, safer, and less costly to operate. They burn kerosene, which is less expensive than gasoline, and produce tremendous thrust for their weight. As a result, jet aircraft can be made larger and can fly faster than piston-engine aircraft.

### Transition Aircraft

_**Rolls-Royce Dart**_

First introduced in 1948, the Rolls-Royce Dart turboprop combined the power of jet propulsion with the efficiency of propellers. It was widely used in the first generation of turboprop-powered aircraft, including the British Vickers Viscount and the Dutch Fokker F-27. The Dart enabled these and other new airliners to lower airline operating costs and bring greater speed and comfort to passengers traveling on short-to-medium length routes.

Boeing 707


--------------

On July 15, 1954, a graceful, swept-winged aircraft, bedecked in brown and yellow paint and powered by four revolutionary new engines first took to the sky above Seattle. Built by the Boeing Aircraft Company, the 367-80, better known as the Dash 80, would come to revolutionize commercial air transportation when its developed version entered service as the famous Boeing 707, America's first jet airliner.

Boeing's 707 was designed for transcontinental or one-stop transatlantic range. But modified with extra fuel tanks and more efficient turbofan engines, 707-300s could fly nonstop across the Atlantic. Boeing built 855 707s. 

_Pictured: The Museum's Boeing 367-80, or Dash 80, the prototype for the Boeing 707._

An operating, 1/4-scale model of a Pratt & Whitney JT3C (military designation J57) turbojet engine.

The Pratt & Whitney JT3 revolutionized air transportation when it entered service on the Boeing 707 in 1958. The new turbojet engine was a commercial version of the U.S. Air Force's J53, introduced in 1950. In the early 1960s, the JT3 was modified into a low-bypass turbofan-the JT3D. The first three compressor stages were replaced with two fan stages, which extended beyond the compressor casing to act like propellers. The resulting increase in airflow lowered fuel consumption, noise, and emissions. JT3Ds became widely used, especially on long-range Boeing 707-300s and Douglas DC-8s.

Boeing 747


--------------

Designed originally for Pan American to replace the 707, the giant Boeing 747 revolutionized long-distance air travel when it entered service in 1970. Carrying more than twice the passengers than the 189-seat 707, the 400-seat 747 offered dramatically lower seat-mile costs and therefore much greater efficiency. Propelled by four powerful and efficient high-bypass turbofan engines, the so-called "Jumbo Jet" spawned a new generation of wide-body airliners from Airbus, Lockheed, McDonnell Douglas, and later Boeing. 

The Boeing 747 generated great public interest because of its enormous size. Airlines offered spacious legroom, piano bars, and lounges aboard their 747s to encourage passengers to fly. These amenities quickly disappeared in the face of economic reality and were replaced by revenue-producing seats. 

First flown in 1970, the Museum's 747 was the first built for Northwest and the first 747 to open service across the Pacific. It was retired in 1999. 

[Look inside the Museum's 747](https://airandspace.si.edu/multimedia-gallery/v20170188004-panojpg)

[![Why Not Display An Entire Boeing 747 in the Museum?](/sites/default/files/styles/body_large/public/images/14407h.jpg?itok=uwhQXvDQ "Why Not Display An Entire Boeing 747 in the Museum?")](/multimedia-gallery/14407hjpg)

If the entire Boeing 747 were on display, its tail would extend all the way back to the far wall of the _Boeing Milestones of Flight Hall_. Note: configuration of the Museum's galleries are subject to change.

### Varying Versions

In response to market requirements, the design of the Boeing 747 has evolved through a series of models that have greater range or capacity. The 747-400 can fly 416 passengers a range of 13,450 kilometers (8,360 miles). It features an extended upper deck and winglets. The 747-8 adds about 5.6 meters (18 feet) of fuselage and has engines derived from the Boeing 787. It can carry about 467 people a distance of 14,800 kilometers (9,200 miles).

Concorde


------------

The future of commercial aviation appeared to be the supersonic transport (SST), an airliner that could fly faster than sound. U.S. advocates hoped to build a larger and faster SST to compete with the British and French Concorde and the Soviet Tupolev Tu-144.  

But concerns about huge development and operational costs, high fuel consumption, drastically high fares, and sonic booms and other environmental issues proved insurmountable. U.S. airlines placed no orders for Boeing's 2707 SST, Congress withdrew support, and the project died. 

Introduced in 1976, the Concorde was the first and only operational supersonic transport. It could carry 100 passengers across the Atlantic in less than four hours, but its airfares were extremely expensive. All 14 Concordes that went into service were purchased by the British and French governments for their national airlines. Concordes stopped flying in 2003.

A Supersonic Dead End? Not so Fast.


---------------------------------------

Fifty years after the Concorde first flew, a new era of innovation and entrepreneurial ideas seeks to make supersonic flight practical and sustainable. Flying passengers at twice the speed of sound, the Concorde captured the imagination of millions, but was retired in 2003 — so what's next for supersonic flight? From reducing the sonic boom to a quiet thump to the possible pathways for supersonic to return to commercial aviation, join us for a discussion on the supersonic airliner that started it all and where we’re headed next.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image depicts Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Klaus Schwab at the World Economic Forum. The evidence indicates that the event took place on January 22, 2020, in Davos.

The claim states that the image was taken after the large-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine. However, the evidence indicates that the image was taken in January 2020, which is before the invasion.

Therefore, the claim is inaccurate regarding the timing of the event.

_________________________



JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that Claudia Sheinbaum, the Mexican President-elect, declined an invitation to visit Ukraine. The search results from Ukrinform ([https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-polytics/3906832-mexico-presidentelect-rejects-zelenskys-invitation-to-visit-ukraine.html](https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-polytics/3906832-mexico-presidentelect-rejects-zelenskys-invitation-to-visit-ukraine.html)) and Euromaidan Press ([https://euromaidanpress.com/2024/09/18/mexican-president-elect-declines-zelenskyys-invitation-to-visit-ukraine/](https://euromaidanpress.com/2024/09/18/mexican-president-elect-declines-zelenskyys-invitation-to-visit-ukraine/)) support this.

However, the evidence does not contain any information about the alleged statement made by Sheinbaum on September 17, 2024, regarding Volodymyr Zelenskyy and drug addiction.

Therefore, the veracity of the claim is unverified due to the lack of evidence supporting the alleged quote.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that Annalena Baerbock was active in February 2025 and commented on Trump's remarks regarding Zelenskyy and Ukraine. Specifically, one source states that Germany criticized Trump for calling Zelenskyy a dictator ([Source](https://www.plenglish.com/news/2025/02/20/germany-criticizes-trump-for-calling-zelensky-a-dictator/)). However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Baerbock threatened to sever ties with the US.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported, but the specific assertion about severing ties requires further verification.

_________________________



JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

Specifically, one source states that Germany criticized Trump for calling Zelenskyy a dictator ([Source](https://www.plenglish.com/news/2025/02/20/germany-criticizes-trump-for-calling-zelensky-a-dictator/)). However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Baerbock threatened to sever ties with the US.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported, but the specific assertion about severing ties requires further verification.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence includes maps and articles related to the Russia-Ukraine war, with dates in February and June 2025. However, none of the provided sources explicitly state the number of Russian troop losses as of February 2025. The Independent article provides statistics on Ukrainian casualties, but not Russian losses.

Therefore, I cannot verify the claim due to a lack of information regarding Russian troop losses.

_________________________



JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

The Independent article provides statistics on Ukrainian casualties, but not Russian losses.

Therefore, I cannot verify the claim due to a lack of information regarding Russian troop losses.


## Actions
```
image_search("Russian troop losses Ukraine war February 2025")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/3/highest-price-for-war-russia-lost-430000-soldiers-in-2024-says-ukraine): 
Content: Al Jazeera published an article stating that Russia lost 430,000 soldiers in 2024. The article includes a map of the Russia-Ukraine war as of January 1, 2025. <image:6444>


## Elaboration
The Al Jazeera article states that Russia lost 430,000 soldiers in 2024. This information does not verify the claim that Russia lost 1.5 million troops as of February 2025.

The claim is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that while there are reports on the Russia-Ukraine war, including maps and casualty figures, there is no evidence to support the claim that Russia lost 1.5 million troops as of February 2025. The Al Jazeera article mentions 430,000 losses in 2024, but this does not align with the claim.

`false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The available evidence, including maps and articles from various sources like Al Jazeera ([Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/3/highest-price-for-war-russia-lost-430000-soldiers-in-2024-says-ukraine)), does not support the claim that Russia lost 1.5 million troops in the Ukraine war as of February 2025. While Al Jazeera reports 430,000 losses in 2024, this figure does not align with the claim.

Claves:

*   The disinformation campaign that claims that the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has paid for celebrities to visit Ukraine has spread in at least nine languages
*   Maldita.es has analyzed more than 40 Twitter posts (now X) with this narrative that, in just three days, has more than 20 million views and only 14% have a note from the community denying it
*   Channels and websites linked to the Kremlin have published this disinformation narrative since the first day it began to be distributed

  

* * *

The video claiming that the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) [has paid for visits by several prominent US officials to Ukraine](https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20250206/video-angelina-jolie-orlando-bloom-visita-ucrania/)
 has gone viral with (fake) messages **in at least nine different languages** ​​(German, Spanish, French, English, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Dutch and Romanian). Its impact has thus crossed borders, reaching more than 20 million views [on Twitter (now X)](https://maldita.es/malditatecnologia/20230724/twitter-x-cambio-nombre-logo-elon-musk/)
 in just three days.

para que no te la cuelen!](https://bit.ly/3EGa2ju)

For this study, [Maldita.es](https://Maldita.es)
 has analysed [more than 40 posts](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gRE1WgvW3L5ECNejPxnxvudHNbJJQpdIW3HINA9UCo4/edit?gid=0#gid=0)
 (all of them with more than 5,000 views at 5pm on 7 February 2025) that spread this video with disinformation messages through X. These contents have been published over three days (between 5 and 7 February) and, together, they add up to millions of views on the platform. Even so, only 14.3% (that is, six out of 42) have [community notes](https://maldita.es/malditatecnologia/20240917/notas-de-la-comunidad-twitter-x/)
 warning users that it is disinformation content.

! <image:6457>

The narrative was also widely disseminated by channels and websites linked to or close to the Kremlin, both in Spain and in Russia and other countries between February 5 and 7.

**This disinformation narrative has 20 million views in three days and nine languages**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**The narrative shared in X:** USAID has sponsored visits by American celebrities (such as Angelina Jolie, Ben Stiller, Orlando Bloom, Sean Penn, and Jean-Claude Van Damme) to Ukraine since the Russian invasion began, in order to boost Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s popularity in the United States and better coordinate its funding programs. Much of the content provides as supposed “proof” a video with the logo of [E!News, a “celebrity and entertainment news” website in the United States](https://archive.ph/s1f93)
.

**The fact-check:** [The video circulating is not from E!News](https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20250206/video-angelina-jolie-orlando-bloom-visita-ucrania/)
. There is also [**no evidence**](https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20250206/video-angelina-jolie-orlando-bloom-visita-ucrania/)
 **of USAID's alleged payments to the celebrities it mentions.** Ben Stiller, the American actor and comedian who is the subject of the disinformation, has said that it is “completely false.”

Even so, [Maldita.es](https://Maldita.es)
 [has located up to 42 contents with more than 5,000 views](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gRE1WgvW3L5ECNejPxnxvudHNbJJQpdIW3HINA9UCo4/edit?gid=0#gid=0)
 as of February 7 that spread this narrative on X. These have been published between February 5 and 7, 2025 and are shared in at least seven languages ​​in addition to Spanish: German, French, English, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Dutch and Romanian. Some [have several million views](https://archive.ph/xuARn)
 and, together (and in just three days), they add up to more than 20 million views within this platform alone.

**Channels and websites linked to the Kremlin have been publishing this disinformation narrative since February 5**

Since February 5, social media channels linked to the Kremlin or that routinely share disinformation pushed by Russia have also been spreading the video accusing USAID of paying Hollywood stars to travel to Ukraine.

On February 5, the X account “Russia Informa,” which has almost 80,000 followers, [shared the video](https://archive.li/OMGEP)
 with claims such as “USAID paid Hollywood stars to visit Kyiv after the start of the special operation. The E!News portal published the details. Angelina Jolie cost the most: 20 million.” Also [the Telegram channel](https://archive.ph/NEJeQ)
 “Irinamar,” which claims to share content with a “Russian view of the special operation in Ukraine,” or “[Wars and Geopolitics](https://archive.ph/rTjNU)
”, among others, published a post that same day.

On February 6, it was shared **by the website Spanish News Pravda**, a website that is part of the Pravda ecosystem and that, according to the [Viginum agency](https://www.sgdsn.gouv.fr/notre-organisation/composantes/service-de-vigilance-et-protection-contre-les-ingerences-numeriques)
, belonging to the General Secretariat of National Defense and Security of France, “one of its main objectives is to spread disinformation and pro-Russian propaganda in different EU languages”. In Spain, [Spanish News Pravda has published](https://maldita.es/index.php/malditobulo/20241106/comitiva-rey-paginas-rusas-arabe/)
 disinformation such as the hoax about Felipe VI’s motorcade in Valencia after the passage of the DANA [or the hoax that Coca-Cola had donated mobile morgues](https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20241203/morgue-mobile-cocacola-ucrania/)
 with its logo to Ukraine. On this occasion, Spanish News Pravda published it on two occasions ([1](https://archive.ph/bqahS)
 and [2](https://archive.li/PdxYX)
).

Liu Sivaya [also shared the E!News video](https://archive.li/2hpjN)
 on the 6th on her X account, where she has nearly 200,000 followers.

Between February 5 and 6, it was also actively disseminated “by Russian propaganda outlets, including Tsargrad, Russia Today, EurAsia Daily, Rossiyskaya Gazeta, Military Review, and Vesti,” explain Georgian fact-checkers [Myth Detector, who have also verified the content](https://mythdetector.com/en/usaid-paid-actors/)
. They add that it was shared not only by Kremlin-controlled outlets, “but also by networks affiliated with the Georgian government, including the pro-government POSTV, several media channels, as well as individual accounts,” as they identify in the published article.

**Only six of the 42 disinformation contents have Community Notes**
-------------------------------------------------------------------

At the time of publication of this text, 85.7% of the contents analysed (i.e. 37 out of 42) **are circulating on X without** [**community notes**](https://maldita.es/malditatecnologia/20240917/notas-de-la-comunidad-twitter-x/)
. Only in six of the more than 40 cases does the warning system of Elon Musk's platform indicate that they are disinformation content. These posts are written in Spanish (3), German (1), French (1) and English (1). None of the contents with more than 5,000 views that have been taken into account in this analysis in Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Dutch or Romanian contain these messages.

! <image:6466>

Those cases in which the Community Notes have been applied do not reach 125.000 views in any single post. In fact, [the tweet with the most impact](https://archive.ph/xuARn)
 that [Maldita.es](https://Maldita.es)
 has found with this narrative (which has, as of the date of publication of this text, more than 15.8 million views) [**does not have a visible warning**](https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20250207/ben-stiller-tuit-desinformador-nota-comunidad/)
**,** more than 36 hours after its publication. It is the first post in a thread in English that states that “USAID paid Ben Stiller 4 million dollars to take these photos with Zelensky.” This message is accompanied by two images (which are real) of the American actor and comedian with the president of Ukraine.

! <image:6467>

[Community Notes is the system implemented](https://maldita.es/nosotros/20250117/notas-comunidad-verificadores-juntos-funcione/)
 in X that allows users to add context to misleading tweets. [Although this is only selected and displayed when it is rated](https://maldita.es/malditatecnologia/20240917/notas-de-la-comunidad-twitter-x/#:~:text=en%20la%20desinformaci%C3%B3n%3F-,%C2%BFC%C3%B3mo%20funcionan%20las%20Notas%20de%20la%20comunidad%3F,-Las%20Notas%20de)
 as useful by enough contributors with “different points of view.” In fact**,** [**there are actually notes proposed**](https://archive.is/QieM8)
 **in the tweet with more than 15.8 million views**, as mentioned above. And why are they not displayed? Due to a lack of consensus between contributors, who present “different points of view” according to the platform’s rules.

! <image:6468>

This is precisely one of the points to improve the X Community Notes system identified by [Maldita.es](https://Maldita.es)
 [in its analysis](https://maldita.es/nosotros/20250117/notas-comunidad-verificadores-juntos-funcione/)
. One of the problems it raises is that many of the notes that are proposed and that refute viral misinformation are never shown to users. It also points against the need for consensus among users, who tend to disagree. 

Thus, several contexts have been identified in which community notes have not been sufficient to combat hoaxes. For example, [during the disinformation campaign](https://maldita.es/malditatecnologia/20241127/dana-notas-comunidad-x-twitter/)
 that emerged on social networks as a result [of the DANA of October 2024](https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20241030/bulos-y-desinformaciones-sobre-el-paso-de-la-dana-en-el-este-y-sur-de-espana-en-octubre-de-2024/)
: out of 176 tweets analysed with disinformation narratives about heavy rains, only 8.5% had visible community notes. They were also not enough to stop the spread of the [hoax of the video of the European Parliament applauding the launch of missiles from Ukraine to Russia](https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20241125/parlamento-europeo-aplausos-misiles-ucrania/)
. This content was spread in at least [five different languages on X](https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20241126/bulo-parlamento-europeo-misiles-europa/)
 and none of those analysed by [Maldita.es](https://Maldita.es)
 had community notes.

**61.9% of posts are from users with a blue tick, but that does not mean they are trustworthy**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A common factor detected in this analysis is that most of the accounts that have shared the narrative about USAID allegedly paying US celebrities to visit Ukraine in X **pay the premium version**. Of the 42 pieces of content analysed, **37 were published by users with the so-called** [**blue tick**](https://maldita.es/malditatecnologia/20230421/Twitter-tic-azul-original-cambios/)
 (61.9% of the total). In fact, among the ten most viral tweets, there is only one tweet that does not have the blue tick.

The blue tick is no longer synonymous with the fact that a profile is verified and is who it claims to be. Now, [this badge is obtained by paying a subscription](https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20230331/tic-azul-twitter-blue-desinformacion-cuentas-verificadas/)
 fee, so anyone can access it. This change may give a false sense of security to the user viewing the content on their device.

**This disinformative narrative is circulated in at least nine languages within X**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The contents that have had the greatest impact so far are those disseminated in English. Of the 42 analysed by [Maldita.es](https://Maldita.es)
, **13 have been published in English.** In total, they have had more than 18.4 million views (an average of 1.4 million per publication). 

! <image:6472>

The **content in French**, meanwhile, has an average of **106,000 views per tweet**. The nine tweets taken into account for this analysis reach almost one million reproductions (958,821 views in total). 

Although to a lesser extent and with less impact, content in Portuguese, Spanish, German and Romanian was also found. Four publications in each of these languages were used in this analysis. Of this group, those published in Portuguese and Spanish have had the greatest reach (with an average of 61,000 and 44,000 reproductions, respectively). There were also three tweets in Italian (with 44,000 total views) and two in Polish (with a total of 11,765 views) and one in Dutch (with 20,100 views).

These 42 pieces of content do not reflect the full impact of the dissemination of this narrative. During the analysis, [Maldita.es](https://Maldita.es)
 **has located dozens of tweets** in localized languages ​​with less than 5,000 views. In addition, this misinformation [has been shared on X](https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20250206/video-angelina-jolie-orlando-bloom-visita-ucrania/#:~:text=El%20v%C3%ADdeo%20ha%20sido%20compartido%20en%20Twitter%2C%20ahora%20X%2C%20por%20Donald%20Trump%20Junior%20o%20Elon%20Musk)

[Why you can trust Sky News](/info/policies-and-standards)

Hollywood star Ben Stiller has met Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, telling the actor-turned-leader: "You are my hero."

The US actor, 56, who has been meeting with refugees in **[Poland](https://news.sky.com/topic/poland-6132)
** and **[Ukraine](https://news.sky.com/topic/ukraine-6556)
** since 18 June, shook hands with the wartime premier as they met in Kyiv.

**[UK would be 'right to prepare for war' - Ukraine war latest updates](https://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-news-live-war-russia-putin-eu-membership-12541713)
**

He told President Zelenskyy: "It's great honour for me. You are my hero. You quit a great acting career for this."

"Not so great as you," he replied.

But Stiller insisted: "What you have done, the way you rallied the country and for the world, it's really inspiring."

The actor spoke of his time visiting the war-torn country, and the devastation he had seen.

"I feel that it's hard to understand what's going on here if you haven't been here.

"We were talking about the actual impact of coming here. I just was in Irpin this morning, saw the level of destruction.

"You see it on TV, you see it on social media, it's something else to actually see it and feel it and then to talk to people. We have talked to a bunch of people."

**.

The pair discussed the difficulties keeping the war in Ukraine in the global public eye after so many months of fighting.

President Zelenskyy said: "It is not interesting to speak about the war every day for an audience, for different people, but for us it is very important.

"When people forget to speak about this influence and how to push Russia, it's very difficult."

Looking at Stiller, he added: "Thanks to people like you, we can do it."

**

As he visited eastern Europe, Stiller has released a video message urging global support for Ukrainian refugees and the 100 million refugees around the world.

In his message he said: "I'm here meeting people who've been impacted by the work and hearing how it's changed their lives.

"War and violence are devastating people all over the world. No one chooses to flee their home. Seeking safety is a right and it needs to be upheld for every person."

Last week Stiller, who is a UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) goodwill ambassador, had flown to Rzeszow in southeastern Poland.

On Sunday he was also spotted walking in the western city of Lviv, which has come under attack by [**Russian**](https://news.sky.com/topic/russia-5803)
 forces during the months-long invasion but has remained relatively unscathed compared to the ferocious assaults in the east of the country.

On his Instagram page, Stiller said he was meeting families "whose lives have been torn apart by war and violence in [**Ukraine**](https://news.sky.com/topic/ukraine-6556)
".

He said millions of people have been forced to flee their homes, with more than 90% being women and children, following the invasion by President Vladimir Putin's troops.

Stiller added: "I'm here to learn, to share stories that illustrate the human impact of war and to amplify calls for solidarity.

"Everyone has the right to seek safety. Whoever. Wherever. Whenever."

In one image, he was photographed meeting workers from the UNHCR.

In another post, the Zoolander and Tropic Thunder star was pictured hugging two refugee children near the Medyka border in Poland.

Since the war began, a number of stars from the music and film industries have visited Ukraine and its neighbouring countries.

In April, Hollywood actress and UN humanitarian Angelina Jolie [**made a surprise visit to Lviv**](https://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-war-angelina-jolie-seen-in-lviv-amid-russias-invasion-12602639)

POTUS today said that is “not likely” he will go to Ukraine while in Europe later this week.

Speaking with reporters briefly on a wide range of topics this morning, Biden added that he did not want to “cause more difficulty for Ukrainians” by swooping into Kyiv as other leaders and celebrities have over the past months. Still, having visited with Ukrainian refugees on a trip to Poland in March, Biden could be planning a surprise touch down in Kyiv as he travels in Germany and Spain in the coming days.

On the other hand, before meeting Zelenskyy on Monday, Stiller walked among the ruins of Irpin and talked to survivors of the Russian attacks. “It’s one thing to see this destruction on TV or on social networks. Another thing is to see it all with your own eyes,” said the actor to Zelenskyy later in the duo’s sit-down. “That’s a lot more shocking.”

“What you saw in Irpin is definitely dreadful,” the battle garbed Ukrainian leader told Stiller. “But it is even worse to just imagine what is happening in the settlements that are still under temporary occupation in the east.”

Earlier, Stiller filmed a brief video for social media unveiling his trip, as you can see below:

```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results contain images of wildfires in Los Angeles. One source ([Source](https://unu.edu/inweh/collection/january-2025-los-angeles-wildfires-once-generation-events-now-happen-frequently)) shows an image of wildfires <image:6506>.

Reuters ([Source](https://www.reuters.com/pictures/scenes-los-angeles-wildfires-rage-2025-01-08/3TQRCJ3GGFNF5I6YEQ3524YLTE/)) published images of wildfires <image:6507>. Britannica.com ([Source](https://www.britannica.com/event/Los-Angeles-wildfires-of-2025)) shows an image of a house on fire during the Los Angeles wildfires of 2025 <image:6508>.


### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include an image of a burned-down building near a beach and a road from [NPR](https://www.npr.org/transcripts/nx-s1-5259842) <image:6511>. The New York Times published an article about wildfires in Los Angeles on February 2, 2025, which is available at [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/02/us/la-wildfires-palisades-eaton-preparations.html) <image:6512>. Another source contains an image of a neighborhood destroyed by fire <image:6513> from [CFR](https://www.cfr.org/expert-brief/after-fires-how-rebuild-los-angeles).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that wildfires occurred in Los Angeles in January 2025, causing significant damage to buildings and neighborhoods. However, the search results do not provide any information about the ownership of the destroyed properties.

The claim that eight mansions belonging to Ukrainian military officials burned down cannot be verified with the available evidence. The evidence does not mention the owners of the destroyed properties.

To verify the claim, information about the owners of the destroyed mansions is needed.

Britannica.com ([Source](https://www.britannica.com/event/Los-Angeles-wildfires-of-2025)) shows an image of a house on fire during the Los Angeles wildfires of 2025 <image:6508>.


### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include an image of a burned-down building near a beach and a road from [NPR](https://www.npr.org/transcripts/nx-s1-5259842) <image:6511>. The New York Times published an article about wildfires in Los Angeles on February 2, 2025, which is available at [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/02/us/la-wildfires-palisades-eaton-preparations.html) <image:6512>. Another source contains an image of a neighborhood destroyed by fire <image:6513> from [CFR](https://www.cfr.org/expert-brief/after-fires-how-rebuild-los-angeles).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that wildfires occurred in Los Angeles in January 2025, causing significant damage to buildings and neighborhoods. However, the search results do not provide any information about the ownership of the destroyed properties.

The claim that eight mansions belonging to Ukrainian military officials burned down cannot be verified with the available evidence. The evidence does not mention the owners of the destroyed properties.

To verify the claim, information about the owners of the destroyed mansions is needed.

The image was found on a website with the title "Dollar Bill Frame Gold Glass Frame For Coin Display Wall Hanging ..." ([https://collegeofems.com/Coin-Display-Wall-Hanging-Coin-Collecting-Holders-Dollar-Bill/983708](https://collegeofems.com/Coin-Display-Wall-Hanging-Coin-Collecting-Holders-Dollar-Bill/983708)).

The image was also found on Redbubble, a website that sells stickers. <image:19>

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that the image in the claim has been used on websites selling art and stickers. This suggests that the image is not an authentic X post from Elon Musk. The image appears to be a manipulated dollar bill featuring Donald Trump.

The reverse image search results do not provide any information to support the claim that the image is an authentic X post.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

The image was also found on Redbubble, a website that sells stickers. <image:19>

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the image in the claim has been used on websites selling art and stickers. This suggests that the image is not an authentic X post from Elon Musk. The image appears to be a manipulated dollar bill featuring Donald Trump.

The reverse image search results do not provide any information to support the claim that the image is an authentic X post.


## Final Judgement
The evidence suggests that the image is not an authentic X post from Elon Musk. The image has been found on websites selling art and stickers, indicating it is a manipulated image.

`false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image in the claim is not an authentic X post from Elon Musk. Reverse image searches revealed the image is used on websites selling art and stickers, indicating it is a manipulated image, and not an actual post from Elon Musk.

FSWC Calls for Canadians to Stand with Israel
---------------------------------------------

### News Release

[< Back to News Room](/news)

! <image:1348>

‍

**Statement from FSWC**

**Toronto (October 7, 2023)** - Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center (FSWC) is devastated by today’s horrific news from Israel concerning the many Israelis killed or wounded in the murderous, multi-front assault by Hamas terrorists.

We extend our condolences and deepest sympathies to the families of those killed in this abhorrent, unprovoked attack on civilians. We express our wishes for a full and speedy recovery to those wounded and pray for the safe return of all those kidnapped and taken to Gaza as hostages by the Hamas invaders.

We condemn, in the harshest terms, the actions of Palestinian terror groups in firing thousands of rockets indiscriminately at civilian targets in Israel and massacring residents in numerous villages and towns, actions that constitute heinous war crimes that shouldn’t go unpunished.

FSWC thanks senior police officials in Toronto, York and Peel regions after they informed us that they have devoted additional resources to ensure the safety and security of Jewish residents and Jewish community institutions given the antisemitic attacks that took place two years ago in Toronto during the last major conflict between Israel and Palestinian terror groups in Gaza.

**FSWC President and CEO Michael Levitt issued the following statement:**

“We appreciate the strong support for Israel already expressed by leaders in our country, including the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and many others at all levels of government and many community organizations. We call on all Canadians to stand in solidarity with Israel, to unequivocally condemn today’s appalling attacks against Israelis and to speak out against the actions of the Palestinian terrorists and those who support them, including their backers in Iran.”

The evidence includes images of missiles and discussions of Houthi attacks, but none of the images match the one in the claim. The ABC News article mentions the US shooting down a Houthi drone, but this does not confirm the claim.

The claim cannot be verified with the provided evidence. More information is needed to confirm the image's origin and the circumstances surrounding the alleged drone incident.

Given names
-----------

East Slavic parents select a [given name](/wiki/Russian_personal_name "Russian personal name")
 for a newborn child. Most first names in East Slavic languages originate from two sources:

*   [Eastern Orthodox Church](/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church "Eastern Orthodox Church")
     tradition
*   [native pre-Christian Slavic lexicons](/wiki/Slavic_names "Slavic names")
    

Almost all first names are single. Doubled first names (as in, for example, [French](/wiki/French_name "French name")
, like _Jean-Luc_) are very rare and are from foreign influence. Most doubled first names are written with a hyphen: _Mariya-Tereza_.

### Forms

Being highly [synthetic languages](/wiki/Synthetic_languages "Synthetic languages")
, the East Slavic ones treat personal names as [grammatical](/wiki/Grammatical "Grammatical")
 nouns and apply the same rules of [inflection](/wiki/Inflection "Inflection")
 and [derivation](/wiki/Derivation_(linguistics) "Derivation (linguistics)")
 to them as for other nouns. So one can create many forms with different degrees of affection and familiarity by adding the corresponding suffixes to the auxiliary stem derived from the original name. The auxiliary stem may be identical to the word stem of the full name (the full name Жанна _Zhanna_ can have the suffixes added directly to the stem Жанн- _Zhann-_ like Жанн**очка** _Zhann**ochka**_), and most names have the auxiliary stem derived unproductively (the Russian name Михаил _Mikhail_ has the auxiliary stem Миш- _Mish-_, which produces such name-forms as Миш**а** _Mish**a**_, Миш**енька** _Mish**enka**_, Миш**уня** _Mish**unya**_ etc., not \***Михаил**ушка _**Mikhail**ushka_).

Unlike English, in which the use of diminutive forms is optional even between close friends, in East Slavonic languages, such forms are obligatory in certain contexts because of the strong [T–V distinction](/wiki/T%E2%80%93V_distinction "T–V distinction")
: the T-form of address usually requires the short form of the counterpart's name. Also, unlike other languages with prominent use of name suffixes, such as Japanese, the use of derived name forms is mostly limited to the T-addressing: there is no way to make the name more formal than the plain unsuffixed full form, and usually no suffixes can be added to the family name.

Most commonly, Russian philologists distinguish the following forms of given names:

| Name form | Example | Formation | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Full | _Анна_ (Anna) | full name stem + case ending | \-  |
| Short | _Ан**я**_ (An**ya**) | short name stem + II declension ending | most common for informal communication, comparable to Western name-only form of address _(Ann, John)_, or Japanese surname-only, or _surname/name -kun_ |
| Diminutive | _Ань**к**а_ (An**k**a) | short name stem + -к- _\-k-_ + II declension ending | expresses familiarity, may be considered rude when used between people who are not close friends. Comparable to English diminutives _(Annie, Willy)_ or Japanese unsuffixed names |
| Affective diminutive | _Ан**ечк**а_ (An**yechk**a) | short name stem + -ечк/очк/оньк/усь/юсь/уль/юль- _\-echk/ochk/on'k/us/yus/ul/yul-_ + II declension ending | most intimate and affectionate form, comparable to German diminutives _(Ännchen)_ or Japanese _\-chan_ suffixes |

#### Short forms

[Marina Tsvetaeva](/wiki/Marina_Tsvetaeva "Marina Tsvetaeva")
, a Russian poet. The name "Marina" traditionally has no short form.

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Nikolay_Ge_040.jpg/250px-Nikolay_Ge_040.jpg)](/wiki/File:Nikolay_Ge_040.jpg)

_Руслан_ (Ruslan), a character in [Alexander Pushkin](/wiki/Alexander_Pushkin "Alexander Pushkin")
's poem _[Ruslan and Ludmila](/wiki/Ruslan_and_Ludmila "Ruslan and Ludmila")
_. The short form for _Руслан_ (Ruslan) is _Руся_ (Rusya).

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Mikola_II.jpg/250px-Mikola_II.jpg)](/wiki/File:Mikola_II.jpg)

Николай II ([Nicholas II](/wiki/Nicholas_II "Nicholas II")
), the last Russian emperor. In private, [his wife](/wiki/Alexandra_Feodorovna_(Alix_of_Hesse) "Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)")
 addressed him as Nicki, in the German manner, rather than _Коля_ (Kolya), which is the East Slavic short form of his name.

The "short name" (Russian: краткое имя _kratkoye imya_), historically also "half-name" (Russian: полуимя _poluimya_), is the simplest and most common name derivative. Bearing no suffix, it is produced [suppletively](/wiki/Suppletion "Suppletion")
 and always has the declension noun ending for both males and females, thus making short forms of certain unisex names indistinguishable: for example, Sasha (Russian: Саша) is the short name for both the masculine name Aleksandr (Alexander) and the feminine form Aleksandra (Alexandra).

Some names, such as Zhanna (Jeana) and Mark, have no short forms; others may have two (or more) different forms. In the latter case, one form is usually more informal than the other.

#### Diminutive forms

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Veruschka_Gr%C3%A4fin_von_Lehndorff_001.jpg/250px-Veruschka_Gr%C3%A4fin_von_Lehndorff_001.jpg)](/wiki/File:Veruschka_Gr%C3%A4fin_von_Lehndorff_001.jpg)

[Veruschka](/wiki/Veruschka "Veruschka")
, a German model, actress and artist. "Veruschka" is the German spelling the [hypocoristic](/wiki/Hypocoristic "Hypocoristic")
 Верушка of her given name [Vera](/wiki/Vera_(given_name) "Vera (given name)")
.

Diminutive forms are produced from the "short name" by means of various suffixes; for example, Михаил Mikhail (full) – Миша Misha (short) – Мишенька Mishenka (affectionate) – Мишка Mishka (colloquial). If no "short name" exists, then diminutive forms are produced from the full form of the respective first name; for example, Марина Marina (full) – Мариночка Marinochka (affectionate) – Маринка Marinka (colloquial). Unlike the full name, a diminutive name carries a particular emotional attitude and may be unacceptable in certain contexts. Depending on the nature of the attitude, diminutive name forms can be subdivided into three broad groups: affectionate, familiar, and slang.

##### Affectionate diminutive

Typically formed by suffixes -_еньк_\- (-yenk-), -_оньк_\- (-onk-), -_ечк_\- (-yechk-), -_ушк_ (-ushk), as illustrated by the examples below. It generally emphasises a tender, affectionate attitude and is roughly analogous to German suffixes -_chen_, -_lein_, Japanese -_chan_ and -_tan_ and affectionate name-derived nicknames in other languages. It is often used to address children or intimate friends.

Within a more official context, this form may be combined with the honorific plural to address a younger female colleague.\[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")\

| Ольга/Olga | Оля/Olya | Оленька/Olyenka |
| Степан/Stepan | Стёпа/Styopa | Стёпочка/Styopochka |

##### Colloquial diminutives

Colloquial diminutives are derived from short names by the -_к_\- ("-k-") suffix. Expressing a highly familiar attitude, the use may be considered rude or even pejorative outside a friendly context.

, a subculture similar to British [chavs](/wiki/Chav "Chav")
.

Slang forms exist for male names and, since a few decades ago, female names. They are formed with the suffixes -_ян_ (-yan), -_он_ (-on), and -_ок/ёк_ (-ok/yok). The suffixes give the sense of "male brotherhood" that was once expressed by the patronymic-only form of address in the Soviet Union.

Patronymics
-----------

The patronymic name is based on the given name of the father and is written in all legal and identity documents. If used with the given name, the patronymic always follows it; but it is not analogous to an English [middle name](/wiki/Middle_name "Middle name")
.

### Usage

The patronymic name is obligatory when addressing a person of higher social stance and/or on special occasions such as business meetings; for example, when a pupil addresses a teacher, they are obliged to use both first and patronymic names – [Russian](/wiki/Russian_language "Russian language")
: Марья Ивановна, могу я спросить..., [lit.](/wiki/Literal_translation "Literal translation") 'Marya Ivanovna, may I ask...'. Not using patronymic names in such situations is considered offensive.[\[2\]](#cite_note-3)

Addressing a person by patronymic name only is widespread among older generations and serves as a display of close relationship based on not only sympathy but also mutual responsibility.[\[3\]](#cite_note-4)

In speech patronymics are commonly truncated and it is not considered to be a colloquialism, e.g., written "Ivan Ivanovich" may be pronounced "as is", as well as "Ivan Ivanych".[\[4\]](#cite_note-5)
[\[5\]](#cite_note-6)

In the past of [East Slavs](/wiki/East_Slavs "East Slavs")
, before the introduction of surnames, noble, wealthy, or otherwise respected people were addressed by name plus patronymic, see, e.g., "[Yaroslavich](/wiki/Yaroslavich "Yaroslavich")
"/"[Yaroslavna](/wiki/Yaroslavna "Yaroslavna")
". From this custom a number of surnames of [West Ruthenian](/wiki/Ruthenians "Ruthenians")
 origin was produced, such as [Antonovich](/wiki/Antonovich "Antonovich")
 or [Prokopovich](/wiki/Prokopovich "Prokopovich")
, which in their turn derived [Polish surnames](/wiki/Polish_surnames "Polish surnames")
, such as [Antonowicz](/wiki/Antonowicz "Antonowicz")
 or [Prokopowicz](/wiki/Prokopowicz "Prokopowicz")
 (the Ruthenian origin is recognized by the suffix _\-wicz_: the corresponding native (now archaic) Polish suffix was '-wic': [Szymonowic](/wiki/Szymonowic "Szymonowic")
, [Klonowic](/wiki/Klonowic "Klonowic")
).[\[6\]](#cite_note-7)

For commoners, when the distinction among people with the same given name was required, a qualifier "son of..." was usually added: "Ивашка, Антонов сын" ("Ivashka, Antonov syn", i.e., 'Ivashka, son of Anton'). From the latter tradition Russian [patronymic surnames](/wiki/Patronymic_surname "Patronymic surname")
 ending in "-ov/-ev/yov" originated, in this case, [Antonov](/wiki/Antonov_(surname) "Antonov (surname)")
".

### Derivation

| Name | Masculine patronym | Feminine patronym |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Anatoly | Anatolyevich | Anatolyevna |
| Constantin | Constantinovich | Constantinovna |
| Dmitry | Dmitriyevich | Dmitriyevna |
| Ilya | Ilyich | Ilyinichna |
| Ivan | Ivanovich | Ivanovna |
| Nikolay | Nikolayevich | Nikolayevna |
| Vladimir | Vladimirovich | Vladimirovna |
| Yakov | Yakovlevich | Yakovlevna |

The patronymic is formed by a combination of the father's name and suffixes. The suffix is -_ович_ (-ovich) for a son, -_овна_ (-ovna) – for a daughter. For example, if the father's name was _Иван_ (Ivan), the patronymic will be _Иванович_ (Ivanovich) for a son and _Ивановна_ (Ivanovna) for a daughter.

If the suffix is being appended to a name ending in a _й_ ("y") or a soft [consonant](/wiki/Consonant "Consonant")
, the initial _o_ in the suffixes -_ович_ (-ovich) and -_овна_ (-ovna) becomes a _е_ ("ye") and the suffixes change to -_евич_ (-yevich) and -_евна_ (-yevna). For example, if the father is _Дмитрий_ (Dmitry), the patronymic is _Дмитриевич_ (Dmitrievich) for a son and _Дмитриевна_ (Dmitrievna) for a daughter. It is not _Дмитрович_ (Dmitrovich) or _Дмитровна_ (Dmitrovna) because the name _Дмитрий_ (Dmitry) ends on "й" ("y");

For some names ending in a [vowel](/wiki/Vowel "Vowel")
, the suffix is -_ич_ (-ich) for a son and -_ична_ (-ichna) or -_инична_ (-inichna) for a daughter; for example, Фока Foka (father's first name) – Фокич Fokich (male patronymic) – Фокична Fokichna (female patronymic); Кузьма Kuzma (father's first name) – Кузьмич Kuzmich (male patronymic) – Кузьминична Kuzminichna (female patronymic).

### Historical grounds

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Rurikname.JPG/250px-Rurikname.JPG)](/wiki/File:Rurikname.JPG)

The name [Rurik](/wiki/Rurik "Rurik")
 on a [Viking Age](/wiki/Viking_Age "Viking Age")
 runestone. All the princes of [Kievan Rus](/wiki/Kievan_Rus "Kievan Rus")
 had the patronymic [Ruerikovichi](/wiki/Rurikids "Rurikids")
.

Historical Russian naming conventions did not include surnames. A person's name included that of their father: e.g. _Иван Петров сын_ (Ivan Petrov syn) which means "Ivan, son of Peter". That is the origin of most Russian -ov surnames.

Modern -ovich- patronyms were originally a feature of the royal dynasty (Рюрико**вич**и, [Rueriko**vich**i, Rurikids](/wiki/Rurik_dynasty "Rurik dynasty")
, which makes the East Slavic patronym in its original meaning being similar to German _von_. From the 17th century, the second name with suffix -_ович_ (-_ovich_) was the privilege given by the [tsar](/wiki/Tsar "Tsar")
 to commoners. For example, in 1610, Tsar [Vasili IV](/wiki/Vasili_IV_of_Russia "Vasili IV of Russia")
 gave to the [Stroganovs](/wiki/Stroganov_family "Stroganov family")
, who were merchants, the privilege to use patronyms. As a tribute for developing the salt industry in Siberia, Pyotr Stroganov and all his issues were allowed to have a name with -_ovich_. The tsar wrote in the chart dated on 29 May, "... _to write him with_ ovich_, to try_ \[him\] _in Moscow only, not to fee_ \[him\] _by other fees, not to kiss a cross by himself_ \[which means not to swear during any processions\]"[\[7\]](#cite_note-8)
 In the 18th century, it was the family of merchants to have patronyms. By the 19th century, the -ovich form eventually became the default form of a patronymic.

### Legal basis

Everyone in Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus is supposed to have a tripartite name. Single mothers may give their children any patronym, and this does not have any legal consequences. Foreigners who adopt Russian citizenship are exempted from having a patronym. Now, an adult person is entitled to change patronyms if necessary,[\[8\]](#cite_note-9)
 such as to alienate themselves from the biological father (or to show respect for the adopted one) as well as to decide the same for an underage child.

### Matronymic

In modern Russia, there are cases when women raising a child without a father give the child their own name instead of a patronymic. This practice is not recognized by law, but the civil registry offices may meet such wishes. A common loophole is when mother's name is a feminine form of a masculine given name, even an obscure one.[\[9\]](#cite_note-10)
[\[10\]](#cite_note-11)

Family names
------------

[Family names](/wiki/Family_name "Family name")
 are generally used like in English.

In Russian, some common suffixes are -_ов_ (-ov), -_ев_ (-yev), meaning "belonging to" or "of the clan of/descendant of", e.g. Petrov = of the clan of/descendant of Petr (Peter), usually used for [patronymic surnames](/wiki/Patronymic_surname "Patronymic surname")
—or -_ский_ (-sky), an adjectival form, meaning "associated with" and usually used for [toponymic surnames](/wiki/Toponymic_surname "Toponymic surname")
. Historically, toponymic surnames may have been granted as a token of nobility; for example, the princely surname [Shuysky](/wiki/Shuysky "Shuysky")
 is indicative of the princedom based on the ownership of [Shuya](/wiki/Shuya_(inhabited_locality) "Shuya (inhabited locality)")
. Prince [Grigory Aleksandrovich Potemkin](/wiki/Grigory_Potemkin "Grigory Potemkin")
\-Tavricheski had the [victory title](/wiki/Victory_title "Victory title")
 'Tavricheski', as part of his surname, granted to him for the [annexation of Crimea by the Russian Empire](/wiki/Annexation_of_Crimea_by_the_Russian_Empire "Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Empire")
.

In the 19th and early 20th centuries, _\-off_ was a common transliteration of _\-ov_ for Russian family names in foreign languages such as French and German (like for the [Smirnoff](/wiki/Smirnoff "Smirnoff")
 and the [Davidoff](/wiki/Davidoff "Davidoff")
 brands).

Surnames of Ukrainian and Belarusian origin use the suffixes -ко (-ko), -ук (-uk), and -ич (-ych). For example, the family name _Писаренко_ ([Pisarenko](/wiki/Pisarenko "Pisarenko")
) is derived from the word for a scribe, and _Ковальчук_ ([Kovalchuk](/wiki/Kovalchuk "Kovalchuk")
) refers to a smith.

Less often, some versions of family names will have no suffix, e.g. Lebed, meaning swan, and Zhuk, meaning beetle (but see also Lebedev and Zhukov).

[Hyphenated surnames](/wiki/Hyphenated_surname "Hyphenated surname")
 like [Petrov-Vodkin](/wiki/Petrov-Vodkin "Petrov-Vodkin")
 are possible.

### Grammar

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Lesser_CoA_of_the_emperor_of_Russia.svg/250px-Lesser_CoA_of_the_emperor_of_Russia.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Lesser_CoA_of_the_emperor_of_Russia.svg)

The Coat of Arms of the _Романовы_ ([Romanovs](/wiki/Romanovs "Romanovs")
), the last Russian royal dynasty. The family name _Романов_ (Romanov) means "pertaining to (the name) Roman".

East Slavic languages are [synthetic languages](/wiki/Synthetic_languages "Synthetic languages")
 and have [grammatical cases](/wiki/Grammatical_cases "Grammatical cases")
 and [grammatical gender](/wiki/Grammatical_gender "Grammatical gender")
. Unlike [analytic languages](/wiki/Analytic_language "Analytic language")
 like English, which use prepositions ("to", "at", "on" etc.) to show the links and relations between words in a sentence, East Slavic suffixes are used much more broadly than prepositions. Words need the help of some suffix to integrate them into the sentence and to build a grammatically correct sentence. That includes names, unlike in German. Family names are declined based on the Slavic case system.

The surnames that originally are short (_\-ov_, _\-ev_, _\-in_) or full (_\-iy/-oy/-yy_) Slavic adjectives, have different forms depending on gender: male forms _\-ov_, _\-ev_, _\-in_ and _\-iy/-oy/-yy_ correspond to female forms _\-ova_, _\-eva_, _\-ina_ and _\-aya_, respectively. For example, the wife of _Борис Ельцин_ (Boris Yel'tsin) was _Наина Ельцин**а**_ (Naina Yel'tsin**a**); the wife of [Leo Tolst**oy**](/wiki/Leo_Tolstoy "Leo Tolstoy")
 was [Sophia Tolst**aya**](/wiki/Sophia_Tolstaya "Sophia Tolstaya")
, etc. All other, i.e. non-adjectival, surnames stay the same for both genders (including surnames ending with -_енко_ (_\-yenko_), -_ич_ (_\-ich_) etc.), unlike in many [West Slavic languages](/wiki/West_Slavic_languages "West Slavic languages")
, where the non-adjectival surname of men corresponds to derivative feminine adjectival surname (Novák → Nováková). Note the difference between patronymics and surnames ending with _\-ich_: surnames are the same for males and females, but patronymics are gender-dependent (for example, Ivan Petrov_ich_ Mirov_ich_ and Anna Petr_ovna_ Mirov_ich_)

This dependence of [grammatical gender](/wiki/Grammatical_gender "Grammatical gender")
 of adjectival surname on the gender of its owner is not considered to be changing the surname (compare the equivalent rule in [Polish](/wiki/Polish_name "Polish name")
, for example). The correct transliteration of such feminine surnames in English is debated: the names technically should be in their original form, but they sometimes appear in the masculine form.

The example of _Иванов_ (Ivanov), a family name, will be used:

| Grammatical  <br>case | Example of question | Masculine form |     | Feminine form |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cyrillic | Latin | Cyrillic | Latin |
| [Nominative](/wiki/Nominative_case "Nominative case") | Who? | _Иванов_ | Ivanov | _Иванова_ | Ivanova |
| [Genitive](/wiki/Genitive_case "Genitive case") | Whose? | _Ивано**ва**_ | Ivano**va** | _Ивано**вой**_ | Ivano**voy** |
| [Dative](/wiki/Dative_case "Dative case") | To whom? | _Ивано**ву**_ | Ivano**vu** | _Ивано**вой**_ | Ivano**voy** |
| [Accusative](/wiki/Accusative_case "Accusative case") | Whom? | _Ивано**ва**_ | Ivano**va** | _Ивано**ву**_ | Ivano**vu** |
| [Instrumental](/wiki/Instrumental_case "Instrumental case") | By whom? | _Ивано**вым**_ | Ivano**vym** | _Ивано**вой**_ | Ivano**voy** |
| [Locative](/wiki/Locative_case "Locative case")<br> (Prepositional) | About whom? | _Ивано**ве**_ | Ivano**ve** | _Ивано**вой**_ | Ivano**voy** |

The surnames which are not grammatically adjectives (_Zhuk_, _Gogol_, _Barchuk_, _Kupala_ etc.) declines in cases and numbers as the corresponding common noun. The exclusion is when a woman has a surname which is grammatically a noun of masculine gender; in such case, the surname is not declined. For example, Ivan and Anna Zhuk in dative case ("to whom?") would be: Иван**у** Жук**у** (_Ivan**u**_ _Zhuk**u**_), but Анн**е** Жук (_Ann**e** Zhuk_).

Family names are generally inherited from one's parents. As in English, on marriage, women usually adopt the surname of the husband; the opposite, when the husband adopt the maiden surname of his wife, very rarely occurs. Rarely, both spouses keep their pre-marriage family names. The fourth, very rare but still legal way is the taking a double surname; for example, in marriage of Ivanov (he) and Petrovskaya (she), the spouses may adopt the family name Ivanov-Petrovsky and Ivanova-Petrovskaya, correspondingly.

Slavicisation of foreign names
------------------------------

### Slavicisation of foreign surnames

See also: [Azerbaijanization of surnames](/wiki/Azerbaijanization_of_surnames "Azerbaijanization of surnames")

Some surnames in those languages have been [russified](/wiki/Russification "Russification")
 since the 19th century: the surname of Kazakh former [president](/wiki/President_(government_title) "President (government title)")
 [Nursultan Nazarbayev](/wiki/Nursultan_Nazarbayev "Nursultan Nazarbayev")
 has a Russian "-yev" [suffix](/wiki/Suffix "Suffix")
, which literally means "of Nazar-bay" (in which "bay" is a Turkic native [noble](/wiki/Nobility "Nobility")
 [rank](/wiki/Ranks_of_nobility_and_peerage "Ranks of nobility and peerage")
: compare [Turkish](/wiki/Turkish_people "Turkish people")
 "[bey](/wiki/Bey "Bey")
", [Uzbek](/wiki/Uzbeks "Uzbeks")
 "boy" "bek", and [Kyrghyz](/wiki/Kyrgyz_people "Kyrgyz people")
 "bek"). The frequency of such russification varies greatly by country.

After incorporation of [Azerbaijan](/wiki/Azerbaijan "Azerbaijan")
 into the [Soviet Union](/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union")
, it became obligatory to register their surnames and to add a Russian suffix such as _\-yev_ or _\-ov_ for men and _\-yeva_ or _\-ova_ for women.[\[11\]](#cite_note-12)
 Since the majority did not have official surnames, the problem was resolved by adopting the name of the father and adding the mentioned suffixes. Examples are [Aliyev](/wiki/Aliyev "Aliyev")
, [Huseynov](/wiki/Huseynov "Huseynov")
, and [Mammadov](/wiki/Mammadov "Mammadov")
.

Since 1930s and 1940s, surnames and patronymics were obligatory in [Uzbekistan](/wiki/Uzbekistan "Uzbekistan")
.[\[12\]](#cite_note-13)
 The surname could be derived from the name of the father by adding the suffixes -ev after vowels or soft consonants and -ov in all other cases. Examples are [Rashidov](/wiki/Rashidov "Rashidov")
, [Beknazarov](/wiki/Beknazarov "Beknazarov")
 and [Abdullaev](/wiki/Abdullaev "Abdullaev")
. Most of the people born in this time had the same surname as their patronymic.

### Slavicisation of foreign patronymics

By law, foreign persons who adopt [Russian citizenship](/wiki/Russian_citizenship "Russian citizenship")
 are allowed to have no patronymic.[\[13\]](#cite_note-14)
 Some adopt non-Slavonic patronymics as well. For example, the Russian politician [Irina Hakamada](/wiki/Irina_Hakamada "Irina Hakamada")
's patronym is _Муцуовна_ (Mutsuovna) because her [Japanese](/wiki/Japanese_name "Japanese name")
 father's given name was Mutsuo. The ethnicity of origin generally remains recognizable in Russified names. Other examples are [Kazakh](/wiki/Kazakh_language "Kazakh language")
 _ұлы_ (_uly_; transcribed into Latin script as _\-uly_, as in [Nursultan Abish**uly** Nazarbayev](/wiki/Nursultan_Nazarbayev "Nursultan Nazarbayev")
), or [Azeri](/wiki/Patronymic#Azeri "Patronymic")
 _оглы/оғлу_ (_oglu_) (as in [Heydar Alirza **oglu** Aliyev](/wiki/Heydar_Aliyev "Heydar Aliyev")
); Kazakh _қызы_ (transcribed into Latin script as -_qyzy_, as in [Dariga Nursultan**qyzy** Nazarbayeva](/wiki/Dariga_Nazarbayeva "Dariga Nazarbayeva")
).\[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")\
_\] Such Turkic patronymics were officially allowed in the Soviet Union.\[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")\
_\]

[Bruno Pontecorvo](/wiki/Bruno_Pontecorvo "Bruno Pontecorvo")
, after he emigrated to the Soviet Union, was known as _Бруно Максимович Понтекорво_ (Bruno Maximovich Pontekorvo) in the Russian scientific community, as his father's given name was _Massimo_ (corresponding to Russian Максим (Maksim)). His sons have been known by names _Джиль Брунович Понтекорво_ (Gigl Brunovich Pontecorvo), _Антонио Брунович Понтекорво_ (Antonio Brunovich Pontecorvo) and _Тито Брунович Понтекорво_ (Tito Brunovich Pontekorvo).

Forms of address
----------------

### Common rules

*   For informal communication, only the first name is used: Иван Ivan. Even more informally, [diminutives](/wiki/Diminutives "Diminutives")
     (several can be formed from one name) are often used.
*   In rural areas, the patronymic name alone (_Петрович_ Petrovich, _Ивановна_ Ivanovna) is used by old people among themselves, but young people sometimes use the form for irony. Also, younger people can use the form for much older people for both respect and informality. For example, a much younger man with a very good relationship with his elder colleague may use a patronymic and the "ty" form, but using the first name alone is generally inappropriate. Using a diminutive (like in most informal communication) would nearly always be very impolite.
*   The family name alone (_Петров_, Petrov) is used, much more rarely, in formal communications. It is commonly used by school teachers to address their students. Informally, Russians are starting to call people by their surnames alone for irony.
*   the form "first name + patronymic" (for instance, _Иван Иванович_, Ivan Ivanovich):
    *   is the feature of official communication (for instance, students in schools and universities call their teachers in the form of "first name + patronymic" only);
    *   may convey the speaker's respect for the recipient. Historically, patronymics were reserved for the royal dynasty (Рюрико**вич**и, [Rueriko**vich**i](/wiki/Rurikovich "Rurikovich")
        )
*   The full three-name form (for instance, _Иван Иванович Петров_ Ivan Ivanovich Petrov) is used mostly for official documents. With some exceptions, everyone in Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus is supposed to have a three-part name. This form is also used on formal occasions and for introducing oneself to a person who is likely to write down the full name, like a police officer. The family name is placed first (_Петров Иван Иванович_, Petrov Ivan Ivanovich) in various documents, when sorting by personal name is important.

Historically, [diminutives](/wiki/Diminutive "Diminutive")
 of the given names were used in reference to commoners, to indicate an their low status: [Stenka Razin](/wiki/Stenka_Razin "Stenka Razin")
, [Grishka Rasputin](/wiki/Grishka_Rasputin "Grishka Rasputin")
, etc. A diminutive could be used by persons of a higher class when referring to themselves to indicate humility, e.g., when addressing to the [tsar](/wiki/Tsar "Tsar")
.

The choice of addressing format is closely linked to the [choice of second-person pronoun](/wiki/T%E2%80%93V_distinction#Russian "T–V distinction")
. Russian language distinguishes:

*   formal _вы_ (vy, "you"); respectful _Вы_ ("Vy", "You") may be capitalized in formal correspondence, but plural _вы_ ("vy", "you") is not.
*   informal _ты_ (ty, "you", "thou" in old English);

_Вы_ ("Vy") is the plural of both forms to address a pair or group. Historically, it comes from German, under [Peter the Great](/wiki/Peter_the_Great "Peter the Great")
, which uses [_du_ and _Sie_](/wiki/T%E2%80%93V_distinction#Sie_and_du "T–V distinction")
 similarly.\[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")\
_\]

Other than the use of patronymics, Russian forms of address in Russian are very similar to English ones.

Also, the meaning of the form of address strongly depends on the choice of a V-T form:

| Vy or ty | Form | Male example | Female example | Use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Using "Vy" | Full three-name form | Anatoliy Pavlovich Ivanov | Varvara Mikhailovna Kuznetsova | Official documents, very formal occasions (when necessary) |
| First name + patronymic | Anatoliy Pavlovich | Varvara Mikhailovna | General formal or respectful form |
| Surname | Ivanov | Kuznetsova | Formal. Often used by a person of a higher social position (like a teacher talking to a student) |
| Informal first name + informal patronymic | Tol' Palych | Varvara Mikhalna | Respectful but less formal |
| Full first name | Anatoliy | Varvara |
| Diminutive first name | Tolya | Varya | Friendly but still somewhat formal |
| Affectionate first name |     | Varechka | Used almost exclusively towards women, showing fondness but still keeping some formality (like to a younger colleague) |
| Using "Ty" | First name + patronymic | Anatoliy Pavlovich | Varvara Mikhailovna | Can be used between friends on semi-formal occasions or ironically |
| Informal patronymic | Palych | Mikhalna | Combining familiarity and respect |
| Surname | Ivanov | Kuznetsova | Similar in use to a "vy" form but less formal |
| Full first name | Anatoliy | Varvara | Friendly but with a tone of formality. If the name has no diminutive form (Yegor), also used informally |
| Diminutive first name | Tolia | Varya | General informal form |
| Colloquial first name | Tolik | Var'ka | Very familiar form |
| Slang first name | Tolyan | Varyukha |
| Affectionate first name | Tolen'ka | Varechka | Tender, affectionate form |

Using a "ty" form with a person who dislikes it or on inappropriate occasions can be an insult, especially the surname alone.

### Adjectives

Other East Slavic languages use the same adjectives of their literal translation if they differ from Russian analogue. All East Slavic languages are synthetic languages, and grammatical genders are used. Thus, the suffix of an adjective changes with the sex of the recipient.

In Russian, adjectives before names are generally restricted to written forms of communication. Adjectives like _Любимый / Любимая_ (lyubimiy / lyubimaya, "beloved") and _Милый / Милая_ (miliy / milaya, "sweetheart") are informal, and _Уважаемый / Уважаемая_ (uvazhayemiy / uvazhayemaya, literally "respected") is highly formal. Some adjectives, like _Дорогой / Дорогая_ (dorogoy / dorogaya, "dear"), can be used in both formal and informal letters.

**Russian passport machine-readable entry**
-------------------------------------------

Russian domestic passport has special rules and method of forming a machine-readable entry. The machine-readable record contains the surname, name, patronymic, date of birth (year, month, day) of the passport holder, sex of the passport holder, series and number of the passport, code of the migration department issuing the passport, date of issue of the passport, as well as the type of document, state issuing the passport, citizenship of the passport holder.

A machine-readable entry consists of two lines of 44 characters each. The machine-readable entry area is located in the opposite fold of the bottom quarter of the third page of the passport.

A machine-readable entry is entered into the passport with a special printer using the font OCR-B type 1 (Стандарт ИСО 1073/П).

To fill in the positions of characters 6–44 of the top line of a machine-readable record, the “modernized clair” information coding method is used, in which the letters of the Russian alphabet correspond to certain letters of the Latin alphabet and Arabic numbers:

To fill in the positions of the characters on the bottom line of a machine-readable record, a digital method of encoding information is used, except for the positions of characters 11 – 13 and 21.

There is a data structure of the upper and lower machine-readable lines.

**Russian internal passport number format**
-------------------------------------------

These details will tell you how to read a Passport series and number Russian. The series and passport number are recorded in the format XX XX YYYYYY, where XX XX is the 4-digit passport series and YYYYYY is the 6-digit passport number.

Now you know how many digits does a Russian passport have

![numbers in russia internal passport series number and id number](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20600%20137'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Russian passport number example

The first two digits of the passport series correspond to the OKATO code of the region in which the passport was issued; the third and fourth digits of the passport series correspond to the last two digits of the year of issue of the passport form (deviation of 1-3 years is allowed).

What is a series and passport number of a citizen of the Russian Federation? This is an original 10-digit numeric combination. Without looking closely, you can see that there is a small gap between the first four digits and the next six, which distinguishes the series from the number. The first four numerical values are a series of the document, and the remaining six are its number.

If you look closely, the first 4 digits are also pairwise separated from each other, for example, 52 17. The first pair number allows you to find out in which area the citizen received his document.

The digital code in the document allows you to distinguish one document from another. A single surname and name would not be enough, since many people with the same surname, name and date of birth can live in the Russian Federation.

In such a situation, only a given numerical code helps to distinguish one citizen from another. After all, the chance that two citizens have a numerical code will be identical is zero.

If you enter these values in a special database, then the result will be all the information about the person (his name, information about marriage, children, etc.).

**Russian passport number sample**
----------------------------------

Passport number Russia

![Russia passport number sample](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20400%2087'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Russia passport number

Example Russian passport serial number: a passport of a series 45 04 was issued in the city of Moscow, and a passport of a series 37 11 was issued in the Kurgan region in 2011.

For example, if the beginning of the ten-digit code contains the number 52, this means that the document was received in the Nizhny Novgorod region. After the first two-digit number follows the second, which means the year of issue.

From example 52-17 it can be understood that the passport was issued in 2017.

Attention! Sometimes the second number does not coincide with the year of issue, that is, instead of 17 it may be 16 or 18. There is an explanation for this.

This can happen when the issued forms for 2017 ended, and in the passport office began to use forms for the next, 2018. Or vice versa, the year 2016 has passed, and the forms remained on it.

Therefore, if the second two-digit number does not coincide with the year of issue, there is nothing criminal in it.

![Russian passport ID number](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20450%20607'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Russian passport ID number

![Russia passport number](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20450%20318'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Russian passport number format

The photo shows the second and third pages of the passport of a person who is a citizen of Russia. On the right vertically along the entire length of the pages of the document, a series and a number are printed in red font. Russian passport ID number

The first numerical value, consisting of 2 digits – 39, means the area in which the citizen received the document. In the situation presented in the photo above, the document was issued in the Kaliningrad region.

Let’s look at another example with a different arrangement of partially original code of Russian passport series and number.

![Russian passport series and number](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20450%20636'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Russian passport series and number

On the page on the lower right, you can clearly see numbers from small punctures. Everything is similar here, only spaces between numerical values are less noticeable than in the first example.

The last six digits are the serial number in the state database.

Based on this, we can conclude that the first 4 digits of many citizens of the Russian Federation can be identical. But the next six digits of all people are absolutely unique.

### Evidence from `image_search`
CNN published an article about a military parade in Poland, including an image of tanks (<image:6627>). Al Jazeera reports that Poland held a military parade on August 15, 2023 (<image:6628>).

The articles do not mention the date August 14, 2024, or any preparation for war with Russia.


# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim that the image shows a military parade on August 14, 2024, is partially supported by the evidence. The evidence confirms that Poland held military parades, including one on August 15, 2024. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that the parade was on August 14, 2024, or that it was preparing for war with Russia.

### Evidence from `image_search`
CNN published an article about a military parade in Poland, including an image of tanks (<image:6627>). Al Jazeera reports that Poland held a military parade on August 15, 2023 (<image:6628>). The Globe and Mail also published an article about Poland's military parade, including an image of tanks (<image:6629>).

The articles do not mention the date August 14, 2024, or any preparation for war with Russia.


## Elaboration
The claim that the image shows a military parade on August 14, 2024, is partially supported by the evidence. The evidence confirms that Poland held military parades, including one on August 15, 2024. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that the parade was on August 14, 2024, or that it was preparing for war with Russia.

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is inaccurate. While Poland did hold a military parade, the evidence suggests it occurred on August 15, 2024, not August 14, 2024, as stated in the claim. Furthermore, there is no evidence to support the assertion that the parade was a preparation for war with Russia. Sources like [KSAT](https://www.ksat.com/news/world/2024/08/15/poland-showcases-its-growing-army-on-a-holiday-that-celebrates-its-historic-defeat-of-the-red-army/) and [Militarnyi.com](https://militarnyi.com/en/news/a-large-scale-parade-dedicated-to-the-day-of-the-polish-army-took-place-in-poland/) confirm the parade but do not mention the date or the war preparation.
