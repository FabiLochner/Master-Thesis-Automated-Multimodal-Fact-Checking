The claim 'In August 2024 U.S. President Joe Biden boarded an empty plane after three freed Americans arrived back in the U.S. and exited the aircraft.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not supported by the evidence. While images from the New York Times ([Source](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/02/us/politics/biden-greeting-freed-prisoners.html)) show Joe Biden greeting freed Americans as they exited a plane in August 2024, there is no evidence to suggest that he boarded an empty plane afterward. Images from the Los Angeles Times and ABC News show people inside a plane, but not Biden.

So, the overall veracity is: false
