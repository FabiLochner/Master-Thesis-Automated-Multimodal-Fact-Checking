### Evidence from `image_search`
Human Rights Watch published an article on July 11, 2024, about the Russian attack on a children's hospital in Ukraine on July 8, 2024. ([https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/07/11/russias-july-8-attack-childrens-hospital-ukraine](https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/07/11/russias-july-8-attack-childrens-hospital-ukraine)) Reuters published an article about a Russian missile attack on a children's hospital in Ukraine on July 8, 2024. ([https://www.reuters.com/pictures/russian-missile-attack-hits-ukraine-childrens-hospital-2024-07-08/](https://www.reuters.com/pictures/russian-missile-attack-hits-ukraine-childrens-hospital-2024-07-08/)) PBS.org reports on a Russian missile attack on a Ukrainian children's hospital.

The articles contain images of the aftermath of the attack, including images of the damaged hospital and people. ![image 4615](media/2025-08-23_12-48-1755953308-038832.jpg) ![image 4616](media/2025-08-23_12-48-1755953308-870057.jpg) ![image 4617](media/2025-08-23_12-48-1755953309-015988.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the image in the claim was taken after the Russian missile attack on Kyiv on July 8, 2024, which hit a residential building and the Okhmatdyt hospital. The image appears in multiple news articles reporting on the attack. However, the evidence does not provide information about whether the toys were photoshopped into the image.

Therefore, the claim that the toys were photoshopped cannot be verified with the available evidence. More information is needed to determine the authenticity of the toys in the image.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The Guardian published an article on July 8, 2024, about the Russian bombing of a children's hospital in Kyiv. (![image 6206](media/2025-08-29_22-39-1756507147-410088.jpg)) CNN also reported on the Russian strike on a children's hospital in Kyiv on July 8, 2024, including an image of the damaged building and rubble. (![image 6207](media/2025-08-29_22-39-1756507147-787293.jpg))


## Elaboration
The new evidence does not contain any images of toys in the rubble. Therefore, the claim that the toys were photoshopped cannot be verified with the available evidence.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
NBC News, ABC News, and The Wall Street Journal all published articles about the Russian attack on a children's hospital in Kyiv, including images of the damaged building and the aftermath of the attack. ![image 6212](media/2025-08-29_22-39-1756507160-645916.jpg) ![image 6213](media/2025-08-29_22-39-1756507161-965524.jpg) ![image 6214](media/2025-08-29_22-39-1756507162-671127.jpg) None of the articles mention or show the red toy car.

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the image in the claim is from the aftermath of the Russian attack on the Okhmatdyt hospital in Kyiv on July 8, 2024. However, the additional searches did not yield any information about the red toy car. Therefore, the claim that the toys were photoshopped cannot be verified with the available evidence.


## Final Judgement
The image in the claim is from the aftermath of the Russian attack on the Okhmatdyt hospital in Kyiv on July 8, 2024. However, the additional searches did not yield any information about the red toy car. Therefore, the claim that the toys were photoshopped cannot be verified with the available evidence.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image in the claim depicts the aftermath of the Russian attack on the Okhmatdyt hospital in Kyiv on July 8, 2024, as reported by sources like the [Kyiv Independent](https://kyivindependent.com/boys-body-found-under-rubble-in-kyiv/) and [RBC-Ukraine](https://newsukraine.rbc.ua/news/russian-strike-on-kyiv-number-of-killed-and-1720503127.html). However, the investigation did not find any evidence to support the claim that the children's toys in the image were photoshopped.
