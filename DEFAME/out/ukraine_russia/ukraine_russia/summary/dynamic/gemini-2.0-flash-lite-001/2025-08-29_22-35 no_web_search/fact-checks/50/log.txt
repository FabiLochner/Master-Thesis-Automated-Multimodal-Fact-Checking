The claim 'In February 2025 German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock threatened the US with severing ties amid US President Donald Trump's comments on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Ukraine.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not supported by the evidence. While Annalena Baerbock did comment on Donald Trump's remarks regarding Zelenskyy and Ukraine in February 2025, as evidenced by sources like [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/german-foreign-minister-europe-needs-be-involved-ukraine-talks-2025-02-13/) and [PL English](https://www.plenglish.com/news/2025/02/20/germany-criticizes-trump-for-calling-zelensky-a-dictator/), there is no evidence to support the assertion that she threatened to sever ties with the US.

So, the overall veracity is: false
