The claim 'In a press conference on December 9, 2024 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said: 'I will ask Biden to invite me to NATO ... there's no point in talking to Trump.'' is false.
Justification: The claim is not supported by the evidence. While images and transcripts of Volodymyr Zelenskyy's interviews and meetings with Biden and Trump exist, a search for the specific quote attributed to him on December 9, 2024, yielded no results. Therefore, the claim is unverified.

So, the overall veracity is: false
