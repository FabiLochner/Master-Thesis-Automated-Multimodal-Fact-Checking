The claim 'Russian President Vladimir Putin has declared war on the United States.' is false.
Justification: The fact-check involved multiple image searches related to Vladimir Putin and declarations of war, but none of the search results provided evidence to support the claim that Putin declared war on the United States. The evidence primarily consisted of images of Putin from various news sources, such as [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/03/europe/russia-ukraine-declaration-of-war-intl-hnk-ml) and [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/2/24/putins-speech-declaring-war-on-ukraine-translated-excerpts), without any mention of a war declaration against the U.S.

So, the overall veracity is: false
