The claim 'China and Japan plan to invade the Russian Federation.' is false.
Justification: The evidence, including maps of military activity and reports of joint military exercises between China, Japan, and Russia, does not provide any direct evidence to support the claim of an invasion plan. The presence of military assets and exercises does not necessarily indicate an invasion plan, and the claim remains unverified.

So, the overall veracity is: false
