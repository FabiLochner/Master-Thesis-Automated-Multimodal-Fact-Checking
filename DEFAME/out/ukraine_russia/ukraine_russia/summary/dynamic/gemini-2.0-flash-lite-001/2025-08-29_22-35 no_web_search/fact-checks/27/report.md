### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include an article from [aa.com.tr](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/russia-ukraine-war/ukrainian-president-urges-swiss-government-to-freeze-bank-accounts-of-russian-oligarchs/2540426) with no content. PBS NewsHour has an image of Volodymyr Zelenskyy (![image 6258](media/2025-08-29_22-41-1756507262-253528.jpg)). Al Jazeera published an article about Volodymyr Zelenskyy (![image 6259](media/2025-08-29_22-41-1756507262-394840.jpg)).


### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include images of Volodymyr Zelenskyy near planes. One image from ABC News shows Zelenskyy arriving in the United States on a plane (![image 6261](media/2025-08-29_22-41-1756507268-666585.jpg)), and another from ABC News Australia shows Zelenskyy near a plane (![image 6262](media/2025-08-29_22-41-1756507271-125464.jpg)).

### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraines-zelenskiy-publishes-income-part-transparency-drive-2024-01-28/): 
Content: Reuters published an article on January 28, 2024, about Volodymyr Zelenskyy publishing his income as part of a transparency drive. The article includes an image of Zelenskyy. ![image 6270](media/2025-08-29_22-41-1756507281-940996.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence provides some information about Zelenskyy's assets, but it is insufficient to verify the claim. The image search results show images of a Florida mansion and Zelenskyy near planes, but do not confirm ownership. The Reuters article mentions Zelenskyy publishing his income, which could be used to verify the claim about his income, but the article's content is not provided. The claim about the bank account cannot be verified with the provided evidence.

To verify the claim, I would need information about Zelenskyy's property ownership, bank accounts, and income.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/oct/03/revealed-anti-oligarch-ukrainian-president-offshore-connections-volodymyr-zelenskiy): 
Content: The Guardian published an article in October 2021 about Volodymyr Zelenskyy's offshore connections. ![image 6272](media/2025-08-29_22-41-1756507294-474115.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence from The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/oct/03/revealed-anti-oligarch-ukrainian-president-offshore-connections-volodymyr-zelenskiy](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/oct/03/revealed-anti-oligarch-ukrainian-president-offshore-connections-volodymyr-zelenskiy)) mentions Zelenskyy's offshore connections, which could be related to the claim about his bank account. However, the article's content is not provided, so I cannot verify the claim about the $1.2 billion in an overseas bank account. The evidence does not provide information about the number of homes, private planes, or monthly income.


## Actions
```
image_search("Volodymyr Zelenskyy property declaration")

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.ft.com/content/71ef1c81-6b72-4b48-a25d-71d029327f23): 
Content: The Financial Times published an article with an image of Volodymyr Zelenskyy. ![image 6312](media/2025-08-29_22-43-1756507387-235945.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence is still insufficient to verify the claim. The Financial Times article provides an image of Zelenskyy, but no information about his property, financial assets, or income. The claim remains unverified due to a lack of specific details about Zelenskyy's assets.


## Final Judgement
The claim is not supported by the provided evidence. While some images show Zelenskyy near planes and a Florida mansion, there is no concrete evidence to confirm the specific details of his assets, such as the number of homes, the amount in his bank account, or his monthly income. The search results point to articles about his income declaration and offshore connections, but the content is not provided to verify the claim.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is unsubstantiated. While images show Zelenskyy near planes and a Florida mansion, there is no evidence to confirm the specific details of his assets, such as the number of homes, the amount in his bank account, or his monthly income. The search results point to articles about his income declaration and offshore connections, but the content is not provided to verify the claim.
