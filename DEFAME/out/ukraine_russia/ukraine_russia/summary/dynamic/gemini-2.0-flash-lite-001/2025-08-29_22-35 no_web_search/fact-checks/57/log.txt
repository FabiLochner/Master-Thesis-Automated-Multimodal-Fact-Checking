The claim 'In an interview with podcaster Theo Von in August 2024, Donald Trump criticized British Prime Minister Keir Starmer over a 100-year deal between the U.K. and Ukraine.' is false.
Justification: The available evidence confirms that Donald Trump was interviewed by Theo Von and that Trump and Keir Starmer have met, but it does not provide any information about the content of the interview, specifically whether Trump criticized Starmer over a deal between the U.K. and Ukraine. Therefore, the claim is unverified.

So, the overall veracity is: false
