NDTV has an interview with Tulsi Gabbard (![image 6009](media/2025-08-29_21-01-1756501295-736187.jpg), ![image 6015](media/2025-08-29_21-01-1756501297-681546.jpg)). Halifax City News also features an image of Tulsi Gabbard (![image 6011](media/2025-08-29_21-01-1756501296-479208.jpg)).

The Halifax City News article is available at [https://halifax.citynews.ca/2025/03/17/gabbard-says-trump-is-looking-forward-to-success-ahead-of-talk-with-putin/](https://halifax.citynews.ca/2025/03/17/gabbard-says-trump-is-looking-forward-to-success-ahead-of-talk-with-putin/).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that NDTV did interview Tulsi Gabbard. The Halifax City News article, available at [https://halifax.citynews.ca/2025/03/17/gabbard-says-trump-is-looking-forward-to-success-ahead-of-talk-with-putin/](https://halifax.citynews.ca/2025/03/17/gabbard-says-trump-is-looking-forward-to-success-ahead-of-talk-with-putin/), mentions an interview with Gabbard on March 17, 2025.

However, the evidence does not explicitly state whether Gabbard said that Trump and Putin were good friends. To verify this part of the claim, the content of the NDTV interview and the Halifax City News article needs to be checked.
