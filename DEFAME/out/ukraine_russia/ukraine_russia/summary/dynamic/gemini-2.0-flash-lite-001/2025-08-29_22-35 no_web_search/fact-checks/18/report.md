### Evidence from `image_search`
Reuters reports that a Russian man was sentenced to 14 years in prison for burning the Quran in November 2024 (![image 6194](media/2025-08-29_22-38-1756507123-801805.jpg)). The Moscow Times also reports on the jailing of a Russian man for burning the Quran (![image 6195](media/2025-08-29_22-38-1756507124-233751.jpg)).

The Guardian published an article on November 5, 2024, about a Swedish court jailing a far-right leader who burned the Quran (![image 6196](media/2025-08-29_22-38-1756507124-647583.jpg)).

## Elaboration
The Reuters and Moscow Times reports confirm that a Russian man was sentenced to 14 years in prison for burning the Quran in November 2024. The Moscow Times also mentions additional charges of treason. The Guardian reports on a separate case of a far-right leader jailed in Sweden for burning the Quran.


## Final Judgement
The claim is supported by evidence from Reuters and The Moscow Times, which report on a Russian man being sentenced to 14 years in prison for burning the Quran in November 2024.
