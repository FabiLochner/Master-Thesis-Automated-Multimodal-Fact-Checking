Useful result: From [Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/biden-pushes-new-russia-iran-korea-china-effort-before-trump-term-2024-12-11/): 
Content: Reuters published an article on December 11, 2024, featuring an image of Joe Biden (<image:6621>).

The claim 'While serving as US President in 2024, Joe Biden ordered the US forces to prepare for possible nuclear confrontations with Russia, China, and North Korea.' is false.
Justification: The claim is unsubstantiated. While image searches yielded articles and images related to Joe Biden, Russia, China, and North Korea in 2024, none of the provided evidence confirms that Biden ordered the US forces to prepare for potential nuclear confrontations with these countries. Therefore, the claim is considered false.

So, the overall veracity is: false
