## Evidence
No new evidence found.

## Elaboration
The claim remains unverified. There is no evidence to support the specific quote attributed to Zelenskyy.


## Final Judgement
The search results show images of Zelenskyy with Biden and Trump, and transcripts of Zelenskyy's interviews. However, none of the evidence confirms the specific quote attributed to Zelenskyy in the claim. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is not supported by the evidence. While images and transcripts of Volodymyr Zelenskyy's interviews and meetings with Biden and Trump exist, a search for the specific quote attributed to him on December 9, 2024, yielded no results. Therefore, the claim is unverified.
