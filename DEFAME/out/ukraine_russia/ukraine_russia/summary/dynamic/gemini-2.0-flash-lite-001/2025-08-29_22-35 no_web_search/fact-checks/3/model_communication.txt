This [front cover](https://archive.is/NEPa9)
 on X (formerly Twitter) with a photo of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, purportedly published by _The Economist,_ is ALTERED.

The post accompanying the magazine cover reads, “APOCALYPSE: Allowing missile strikes deep into Russia is the start of World War III,” warns the iconic prophetic magazine The Economist.”

The same claim has been posted [here](https://archive.is/NEPa9)
 and [here](https://archive.is/x6qkC)
.

However, did _The Economist_ publish the front cover? PesaCheck investigated.

_The Economist_ [website](https://www.economist.com/weeklyedition/archive)
 shows no November 2024 covers similar to the one under investigation.

In November, the outlet published two front pages featuring Donald Trump, but none had a photo of Russian President Putin or the headline “Apocalypse.”

Zoom image will be displayed

The alleged front cover circulating online has stories similar to those in [an edition published](https://www.economist.com/weeklyedition/2024-03-16)
 by _The Economist._ However, it was altered to include photos of Trump and Putin.

The [original front cover](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1Di8B4QNPs/)
 has stories from _The Economist’s_ 16 March 2024 edition.

_The altered cover (left) vs the original cover_

Additionally, the fake cover does not display a publication date, whereas authentic covers always indicate when the issue was released, as shown on the [website](https://www.economist.com/weeklyedition/archive)
.

PesaCheck has looked into this front cover on X with a photo of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin purportedly published by _The Economist_ and finds that it was ALTERED.

Hijacked news stories appear in different forms, from basic images to complete websites or social media profiles

Advertisement

Shortly after [Donald Trump](/en/donald-trump/t-19434433)
 won his second term as US president last November, an image of the front cover of _The Economist_ magazine was [shared online](https://archive.ph/nZAM2 "External link — shared online")
 with captions in several languages.

The banner headline read "Apocalypse," and was accompanied by an image of Trump facing Russian President [Vladimir Putin](/en/vladimir-putin/t-17449200)
 with a series of long-range missiles in the background.

Some of the comments linked to the cover feared the start of World War III and speculated about the use of [nuclear weapons](/en/nuclear-weapons/t-63414896)
. 

However, this front cover never really existed, and _The Economist_ did not publish such a story. The alleged cover also cannot be found in [the magazine's archive](https://www.economist.com/weeklyedition/archive?year=2024 "External link — the magazine's archive")
.

It is a [disinformation tactic](/en/fake-news/t-37038790)
 known as "media spoofing." More and more reputable media outlets around the world are seeing their logos, websites, social media profiles and their look-and-feel hijacked to spread false or misleading narratives. 

This disinformation strategy isn't new but it seems to be growing in several regions of the world, as we can see by the sheer list of recent examples.

One such case is [this screenshot](https://archive.ph/NwIMQ "External link — this screenshot")
 of a false CNN article about [Elon Musk's](/en/elon-musk/t-63587027)
 satellite system Starlink carrying out blackouts in Ukraine after the contentious White House visit by President [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](/en/volodymyr-zelenskyy/t-65603134)
 in late February.

Or this [cloned website](https://web.archive.org/web/20230913125635/https:/www.spiegel.ltd/ausland/Sanktionen-gegen-Russland-ruinieren-die-deutsche-Wirtschaft-a-36cbce42-524f-4945-8503-15182c908a97.html "External link — cloned website")
 of German magazine _Der Spiegel_ with the headline "Sanctions against Russia are ruining the German economy."

Or [this website](https://archive.ph/SJvY7 "External link — this website")
, resembling that of French daily _Le Parisien_, saying illegal migrants were a threat to the [2024 Paris Olympics](/en/olympics/t-17351918)
. 

Then there's also [this story](https://archive.ph/j95Jj "External link — this story")
, with the logo of the entertainment site E! News, which said USAID had sponsored celebrity trips to Ukraine. DW's Fact Check department debunked the claim [here](/en/fact-check-trumps-team-targets-usaid-with-false-claims/a-71535712)
, which was reposted by X owner Elon Musk to his 220 million followers and by Donald Trump Jr, the son of the US president, who has 14.7 million followers on the platform. 

However, this is not only a problem in the United States and Europe. Media outlets around the world, from Israel's [_Haaretz_](https://archive.ph/yBmkw "External link — Haaretz")
 to Nicaragua's [_La Prensa_](https://www.laprensani.com/2025/03/19/nacionales/3449647-circula-noticia-falsa-que-utiliza-la-identidad-de-la-prensa "External link — La Prensa")
, have seen their identity hijacked.

La Prensa newspaper in Nicaragua recently revealed its identity had been cloned, and asked readers to carefully check contentImage: laprensani.com

In addition, academics in Nigeria [studied](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/382295421_Between_Trust_and_Misinformation_A_Study_of_User_Engagement_with_Cloned_Pages_of_Daily_Trust_and_Vanguard_Newspapers_on_Facebook "External link — studied")
 several cloned social media profiles, especially on Facebook, of two English-language newspapers, _Vanguard_ and _Daily Trust_. 

So, what's behind this disinformation problem and what impact does it have?

And most importantly, how can you determine whether the news you're consuming comes from a real source? [DW Fact Check](/en/fact-check/t-56584214)
 has some tips. 

From simple photo manipulation to sophisticated media spoofing 
---------------------------------------------------------------

All these examples show that fabricated news reports can appear in different forms: from very basic images that are edited to distort a text or include a media logo, to complete websites or social media profiles that pretend to be a well-known media organization — so-called "media spoofing."

Some of the fakes also use [artificial intelligence](/en/artificial-intelligence/t-42133476)
 tools. And in most cases, they tend to spread faster during breaking news events like elections, wars, natural disasters or economic crises. 

According to NewsGuard, a misinformation and media watchdog in the US, 40 reliable media organizations have been affected by such impersonations since 2018. And the problem is becoming "more widespread with each passing year."

Most of the instances [found by the watchdog](https://www.newsguardrealitycheck.com/p/bad-actors-fake-being-real-news-outlets "External link — found by the watchdog")
 are linked to Russian influence operations that spread anti-Ukrainian and anti-Western narratives.

One such operation is called the "Doppelgänger campaign" and began after [Russia's invasion of Ukraine](/en/russias-war-in-ukraine/t-60931789)
. In [Germany](/en/russian-disinformation-is-growing-in-germany/a-70506294)
, the Foreign Ministry published a [technical report](https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/resource/blob/2682484/2da31936d1cbeb9faec49df74d8bbe2e/technischer-bericht-desinformationskampagne-doppelgaenger-1--data.pdf "External link — technical report")
 last June detailing how the country has been affected by this Russian operation, which included "dozens of forged clones of mainstream media websites." 

German authorities found 'dozens of forged clones of mainstream media websites,' like this fake site of Der Spiegel magazine

McKenzie Sadeghi, who authored NewsGuard's analysis, told DW that this kind of disinformation usually follows a similar pattern: the claims are posted en masse by low-profile accounts on platforms like [Telegram](/en/telegram/t-60588751)
. Some are then picked up by higher-profile individuals, knowingly or unknowingly. 

"The fake continues to gain traction and eventually makes its way into Russian state media, which cites the high-profile figures on social media who share the claim rather than the original Telegram source, completely hiding its actual origins," she said.

Fakes undermining quality of online journalism 
-----------------------------------------------

According to NewsGuard, the media outlets most affected by imitations are BBC, CNN, Al Jazeera, investigative journalism group Bellingcat, Fox News, _The Wall Street Journal_ and _USA Today_. [DW has also been a target in recent years](/en/fact-check-fake-news-and-content-targets-international-media/a-62381229)
.

But the pattern, topics and actors are not always the same, as there are clear regional variations.

In Nigeria, cloned pages of _Vanguard_ and _Daily Trust_ have spread rumors about issues like the [COVID-19 pandemic](/en/covid-19/t-62123668)
, the Boko Haram insurgency or oil prices — topics that have been relevant in the local political debate. 

"Cloned media websites are a huge problem, with potential to undermine the credibility and quality of online journalism, public opinion, the democratic process and social cohesion," Abubakar Tijjani Ibrahim, co-author of the _Vanguard_ and _Daily Trust_ study and lecturer at Kano State Polytechnic in Nigeria, told DW. 

He added that since cloned media sites lack professional ethics and safeguards, "the handlers of the pages tend to sensationalize, presenting issues in the most provocative way."

The URL of this fake website ended in '.top', while the official URL of Le Parisien ends in '.fr.'

What can you do to verify the content? 
---------------------------------------

Check the authenticity of a piece of information by combining critical observation and analysis with the use of tools that can provide valuable (but not infallible) hints. 

A first suggestion is to look for spelling or grammar mistakes, as well as for uneven spacing or blurry text.

If you have doubts, you can open a separate browser window, go to a search engine and actively look for the real news website. You can then contrast the look and feel of both items. Does anything look odd?

While you're on the real site, you can also carry out a keyword search of the alleged piece of information to see if it appears there. And you can check on other media outlets as well. Cross-checking is always key. If something seems off, then there's a likelihood that the story has been made up.

In the case of a screenshot, you can do a reverse image search, using Google Images or Tin Eye, for example. This could offer guidance as to whether the image was used before and whether the story has already been debunked and fact-checked.

A reverse image search of the Economist "Apocalypse" cover revealed several fact checks that disproved the cover's authenticity.

A reverse image search of a dubious front cover can reveal whether the story has been fact-checkedImage: Google

Regarding media outlets' cloned social media profiles, Ibrahim suggests checking whether the profiles provide links to the official news organization's contact details. One of the clones he analyzed on Facebook offered a Gmail account as a contact option. 

For cloned news websites, a further red flag is the URL or web address. A Google search would normally provide the correct website address. A look at the cloned site could reveal variations.

Remember the fake _Le Parisien_ website mentioned above? There, the URL ended in '.top', while the official URL ends in '.fr.' The same happened with the _Der Spiegel_ website: the official site is www.spiegel.de; the fake one was www.spiegel.ltd.

Sadeghi, of NewsGuard, said a further step could be to check the domain registration records, for instance on the [Go Daddy](https://www.godaddy.com/en/offers/whois-b?isc=sem3year&countryview=1&currencyType=EUR&swp_countrycode=DE&cdtl=c_17641286579.g_138121387813.k_kwd-400731202983.a_706593660658.d_c.ctv_g&bnb=b&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwnPS-BhBxEiwAZjMF0tmyXBYuRwTpiUn-erjMOExRdG5eoXShIAGVEhr1taMZGvGfAAIg6RoCtM8QAvD_BwE "External link — Go Daddy")
 platform or on [Who.is](https://who.is/ "External link — Who.is")
.

"There was a fake article on Spiegel.ltd," she explained. "The domain registration records, which are free, and you can look up, showed that it was anonymously registered in June 2022, while the actual domain for the outlet was registered long before." 

In summary, remain vigilant and check whether a story really comes from a reliable news source.

Russian propagandists created counterfeit cover of renowned British magazine to disseminate nuclear threats aimed at Western audiences

The counterfeit cover, circulated by Kremlin-controlled [media outlets](https://msk-news.net/other/2024/11/18/582407.html)
, Russian bots on [X](https://x.com/netsysmx1/status/1858431341609509272)

, features Russian dictator Vladimir Putin and U.S. President-elect Donald Trump against a backdrop of missiles and an explosion-filled sky. It includes the sensational caption "Apocalypse."

According to these propagandists, the issue's supposed theme is that Western approval for Ukraine's long-range strikes deep into Russian territory marks "the beginning of World War III."

! <image:103>

However, this cover is completely fake. It is not available on [The Economist's](https://www.economist.com/weeklyedition/archive)
 official website or [social media accounts](https://twitter.com/TheEconomist?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)
, where authentic covers are consistently published. Notably, the fake cover lacks a publication date, a standard feature of all genuine Economist issues.

! <image:104>

! <image:105>

The actual Economist issue published on November 16 depicts a globe being struck by a golf club with the headline ["What's about to hit the world economy?"](https://www.economist.com/weeklyedition/2024-11-16)
 The magazine's next issue, [scheduled for November 23,](http://https//www.economist.com/weeklyedition/2024-11-23)
 will focus on U.S. billionaire Elon Musk with the headline "Disrupter-in-chief."

! <image:106>

Some Russian media outlets promoting the fake cover have cited a Telegram channel called "The Economist," which is not affiliated with the British magazine. This channel is known for [disseminating disinformation](https://web.telegram.org/a/#-1002005877458)
 and pro-Kremlin content.

! <image:107>

By spreading such fabrications, Russian propaganda aims to intimidate Ukraine's Western allies, discouraging them from supporting Ukraine or allowing long-range strikes against targets deep in Russian territory. At the same time, these efforts seek to bolster the Kremlin dictator's image amid his increasing political isolation.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The BBC News published an article about the funeral of a Ukrainian soldier (<image:6147>). The Los Angeles Times published an article about the war in Ukraine, including an image of a funeral procession in Kyiv (<image:6148>). Al Jazeera published an image of coffins being carried by soldiers in Ukraine (<image:6149>).

The articles can be found here: [https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-64446436](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-64446436), [https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2024-07-06/deadly-russian-strikes-on-ukraine-leave-thousands-without-power-or-water](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2024-07-06/deadly-russian-strikes-on-ukraine-leave-thousands-without-power-or-water), and [https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/27/russia-ukraine-war-list-of-key-events-day-1068](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/27/russia-ukraine-war-list-of-key-events-day-1068).


## Elaboration
The evidence includes articles about the war in Ukraine, but none of them mention the claim. The image search results show images of funerals in Ukraine, but they do not match the image in the claim.

The claim states that the image shows coffins of British Special Forces. However, the evidence does not provide any information to support this statement.

Therefore, there is insufficient information to verify the claim.

The BBC News published an article about the return of the Queen's coffin to RAF Northolt, with an image of a C-17 aircraft (<image:6153>). Alamy shows a photograph of a coffin being carried from a C-17 aircraft related to the repatriation ceremony for 14 British servicemen killed in Afghanistan (<image:6157>). CNN published an article about the Queen Elizabeth's funeral, including an image of a coffin being transported by a C-17 plane (<image:6158>).


## Elaboration
The new evidence shows that C-17 aircraft are used to transport coffins. However, the evidence does not provide any information about the image in the claim. The image search results show images of coffins being transported by a C-17 plane, but they do not match the image in the claim.

The claim states that the image shows coffins of British Special Forces killed in Ukraine. The evidence does not provide any information to support this statement.

Therefore, there is still insufficient information to verify the claim.

Recovery operations at the site of a building hit in Russia's attack on July 8, 2024. (Interior Ministry / Telegram)

The body of a boy was found under the rubble of a building hit by a Russian strike in Kyiv's Schevchenkyvskyi district, bringing the death toll of the July 8 attack on the city to 27, the Interior Ministry said on July 9.

Among the dead are four children, the [Interior Ministry said](https://t.me/mvs_ukraine/39672)
. Another 117 people were injured in Kyiv and seven were rescued from buildings that had been damaged in the strike.

Emergency services are still working at three sites, the ministry said.

Schevchenkyvskyi district is the location of both a residential building hit in Russia's strike and the [Okhmatdyt hospital](https://kyivindependent.com/russian-missile-attack-hits-okhmatdyt-children-hospital-casualties-reported/)
, Ukraine's largest children's medical center, which Russia [directly targeted](https://kyivindependent.com/russian-missile-struck-childrens-hospital-in-kyiv-following-programmed-route-source-says/)
.

The Russian military struck the children's [hospital](https://kyivindependent.com/who-data-suggest-more-ukrainians-could-die-in-medical-site-attacks-in-2024/)
 with a Kh-101 cruise missile, according to the preliminary data obtained by the [**State Security Service**](https://t.me/SBUkr/12339)
 (SBU), killing at least two people and injuring at least 50.

Russia launched [**another attack**](https://kyivindependent.com/latest-russian-attack-on-kyiv-hits-maternity-hospital-4-killed/)
 against Kyiv later during the day, with debris damaging a maternity hospital in another district, killing seven people.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that the image in the claim was taken after the Russian missile attack on Kyiv on July 8, 2024, which hit a residential building and the Okhmatdyt hospital. The image appears in multiple news articles reporting on the attack. However, the evidence does not provide information about whether the toys were photoshopped into the image.

Therefore, the claim that the toys were photoshopped cannot be verified with the available evidence. More information is needed to determine the authenticity of the toys in the image.

### Evidence from `image_search`
Human Rights Watch published an article on July 11, 2024, about the Russian attack on a children's hospital in Ukraine on July 8, 2024. ([https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/07/11/russias-july-8-attack-childrens-hospital-ukraine](https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/07/11/russias-july-8-attack-childrens-hospital-ukraine)) Reuters published an article about a Russian missile attack on a children's hospital in Ukraine on July 8, 2024. ([https://www.reuters.com/pictures/russian-missile-attack-hits-ukraine-childrens-hospital-2024-07-08/](https://www.reuters.com/pictures/russian-missile-attack-hits-ukraine-childrens-hospital-2024-07-08/)) PBS.org reports on a Russian missile attack on a Ukrainian children's hospital. ([https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/russian-missile-attack-hits-ukrainian-childrens-hospital-amid-bombardment-dozens-killed](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/russian-missile-attack-hits-ukrainian-childrens-hospital-amid-bombardment-dozens-killed))

The articles contain images of the aftermath of the attack, including images of the damaged hospital and people. <image:4615> <image:4616> <image:4617>


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the image in the claim was taken after the Russian missile attack on Kyiv on July 8, 2024, which hit a residential building and the Okhmatdyt hospital. The image appears in multiple news articles reporting on the attack. However, the evidence does not provide information about whether the toys were photoshopped into the image.

Therefore, the claim that the toys were photoshopped cannot be verified with the available evidence. More information is needed to determine the authenticity of the toys in the image.

### Evidence from `image_search`
Human Rights Watch published an article on July 11, 2024, about the Russian attack on a children's hospital in Ukraine on July 8, 2024.

The articles contain images of the aftermath of the attack, including images of the damaged hospital and people. <image:4615> <image:4616> <image:4617>


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the image in the claim was taken after the Russian missile attack on Kyiv on July 8, 2024, which hit a residential building and the Okhmatdyt hospital. The image appears in multiple news articles reporting on the attack. However, the evidence does not provide information about whether the toys were photoshopped into the image.

Therefore, the claim that the toys were photoshopped cannot be verified with the available evidence. More information is needed to determine the authenticity of the toys in the image.

The evidence suggests that the image in the claim is from the aftermath of the Russian attack on the Okhmatdyt hospital in Kyiv on July 8, 2024. However, the additional searches did not yield any information about the red toy car. Therefore, the claim that the toys were photoshopped cannot be verified with the available evidence.

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the image in the claim is from the aftermath of the Russian attack on the Okhmatdyt hospital in Kyiv on July 8, 2024. However, the additional searches did not yield any information about the red toy car. Therefore, the claim that the toys were photoshopped cannot be verified with the available evidence.

You are provided with the record of a fact-check. It contains the Claim to be verified and a documentation of all the fact-checking work along the gathered evidence. Your task is to **summarize the fact-check**. That is, you provide a concise, one-paragraph justification for the final VERDICT based on the knowledge from the Record. Note:
* Be truthful, brief, do not add any additional information besides the information given in the Record. 
* Link key sources in your summary. Use Markdown notation for that. You may link them in-line.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:8> This image shows fake children's toys that were photoshopped into the image by the Ukrainian Government after Kyiv's pediatric hospital was attacked by Russian cruise missiles on July 8, 2024."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:8>)
image_search("Kyiv pediatric hospital attack July 8 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The Kyiv Independent published an article on July 9, 2024, reporting on a Russian strike in Kyiv on July 8, 2024, which hit a residential building and the Okhmatdyt hospital. The article includes the image in the claim, showing rubble and emergency personnel. (<image:8>)

RBC-Ukraine also discusses the Russian missile attack on Kyiv on July 8, which hit the Okhmatdyt Children's Hospital. The article mentions that 27 people, including 4 children, were killed and 117 were injured. The image in the claim is present in the article. (<image:8>)

### Evidence from `image_search`
Human Rights Watch published an article on July 11, 2024, about the Russian attack on a children's hospital in Ukraine on July 8, 2024. ([https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/07/11/russias-july-8-attack-childrens-hospital-ukraine](https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/07/11/russias-july-8-attack-childrens-hospital-ukraine)) Reuters published an article about a Russian missile attack on a children's hospital in Ukraine on July 8, 2024. ([https://www.reuters.com/pictures/russian-missile-attack-hits-ukraine-childrens-hospital-2024-07-08/](https://www.reuters.com/pictures/russian-missile-attack-hits-ukraine-childrens-hospital-2024-07-08/)) PBS.org reports on a Russian missile attack on a Ukrainian children's hospital. ([https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/russian-missile-attack-hits-ukrainian-childrens-hospital-amid-bombardment-dozens-killed](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/russian-missile-attack-hits-ukrainian-childrens-hospital-amid-bombardment-dozens-killed))

The articles contain images of the aftermath of the attack, including images of the damaged hospital and people. <image:4615> <image:4616> <image:4617>


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the image in the claim was taken after the Russian missile attack on Kyiv on July 8, 2024, which hit a residential building and the Okhmatdyt hospital. The image appears in multiple news articles reporting on the attack. However, the evidence does not provide information about whether the toys were photoshopped into the image.

Therefore, the claim that the toys were photoshopped cannot be verified with the available evidence. More information is needed to determine the authenticity of the toys in the image.

## Final Judgement

However, the additional searches did not yield any information about the red toy car. Therefore, the claim that the toys were photoshopped cannot be verified with the available evidence.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that there was an offensive in the Kursk region in August 2024, with Ukrainian forces advancing. The image search results do not provide any information about a chemical attack. The geolocation of the image is inconclusive, with Russia being one of the possible locations.

Based on the available evidence, it is impossible to verify the claim that the image shows a chemical attack by the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the Kursk offensive in August 2024. More information is needed to confirm the nature of the attack and the involvement of the Ukrainian forces.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2024/8/13/russia-ukraine-live-news-russia-hits-back-at-ukrainian-forces-in-kursk](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2024/8/13/russia-ukraine-live-news-russia-hits-back-at-ukrainian-forces-in-kursk)) <image:6227>


### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.27, 'Jordan': 0.13, 'Ukraine': 0.08, 'Israel': 0.05, 'Argentina': 0.03, 'Kyrgyzstan': 0.03, 'Lesotho': 0.03, 'Mexico': 0.03, 'Pakistan': 0.03, 'Russia': 0.03}

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that there was an offensive in the Kursk region in August 2024, with Ukrainian forces advancing. The image search results do not provide any information about a chemical attack. The geolocation of the image is inconclusive, with Russia being one of the possible locations.

Based on the available evidence, it is impossible to verify the claim that the image shows a chemical attack by the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the Kursk offensive in August 2024. More information is needed to confirm the nature of the attack and the involvement of the Ukrainian forces.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The new evidence provides additional examples of explosions, including one involving chemicals on a highway. However, none of the new evidence supports the claim about the image depicting a chemical attack by the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the Kursk offensive in August 2024. The search results do not provide any information about the specific event in the image.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified due to a lack of supporting evidence.

The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.27, 'Jordan': 0.13, 'Ukraine': 0.08, 'Israel': 0.05, 'Argentina': 0.03, 'Kyrgyzstan': 0.03, 'Lesotho': 0.03, 'Mexico': 0.03, 'Pakistan': 0.03, 'Russia': 0.03}

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that there was an offensive in the Kursk region in August 2024, with Ukrainian forces advancing. The image search results do not provide any information about a chemical attack. The geolocation of the image is inconclusive, with Russia being one of the possible locations.

Based on the available evidence, it is impossible to verify the claim that the image shows a chemical attack by the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the Kursk offensive in August 2024. More information is needed to confirm the nature of the attack and the involvement of the Ukrainian forces.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include images of explosions and fires. ABC News shows an image of an explosion in Louisiana (<image:6256>), while WAAY TV shows a fire at a Georgia chemical plant (<image:6257>). The Brisbane Times reported on a trailer of chemicals exploding after a crash on the Bruce Highway on August 30, 2024 (<image:6260>).


## Elaboration
The new evidence provides additional examples of explosions, including one involving chemicals on a highway. However, none of the new evidence supports the claim about the image depicting a chemical attack by the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the Kursk offensive in August 2024. The search results do not provide any information about the specific event in the image.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified due to a lack of supporting evidence.

The search results do not provide any information about the specific event in the image.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified due to a lack of supporting evidence.


## Actions
```
image_search("chemical explosion Kursk offensive")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-concerned-ukraines-kursk-assault-russia-prepares-counterattack/story?id=113022137): 
Content: ABC News published an article about the Kursk offensive, including an image of an explosion. <image:6266>


## Elaboration
The new evidence from ABC News shows an image of an explosion related to the Kursk offensive. However, the image does not match the one in the claim. The new evidence does not provide any information about a chemical attack.

The claim remains unverified.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that there was an offensive in the Kursk region in August 2024, but there is no evidence to support the claim that the image shows a chemical attack by the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The image search results do not provide any information about a chemical attack. The geolocation of the image is inconclusive.

`false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is not supported by the evidence. While there was an offensive in the Kursk region in August 2024, as reported by the [Institute for the Study of War](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-august-10-2024) and [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2024/8/13/russia-ukraine-live-news-russia-hits-back-at-ukrainian-forces-in-kursk), there is no evidence to suggest that the image depicts a chemical attack by Ukrainian forces.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that Lech Wałęsa wrote a letter to Donald Trump on March 3, 2025. The letter expressed Wałęsa's criticism of Trump's treatment of Zelenskyy. However, the provided sources do not explicitly mention the suspension of U.S. military aid to Ukraine as the primary focus of Wałęsa's criticism.

Therefore, while the claim is partially supported by the evidence, it is not entirely accurate. The evidence suggests that Wałęsa criticized Trump's actions related to Ukraine, but the specific reason for the criticism is not the suspension of military aid.

To fully verify the claim, information is missing regarding the exact content of Wałęsa's letter and whether it specifically addressed the suspension of U.S. military aid.

The evidence confirms that Lech Wałęsa wrote a letter to Donald Trump in March 2025. The letter expressed criticism of Trump's actions related to Ukraine, specifically his treatment of Zelenskyy.

However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the letter criticized Trump's decision to suspend the delivery of U.S. military aid to Ukraine.

Therefore, the claim is not fully supported by the evidence. The exact content of the letter and whether it specifically addressed the suspension of military aid remains unclear.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The New York Times ([https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/us/politics/lech-walesa-trump-letter.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/us/politics/lech-walesa-trump-letter.html)) published an article about a letter written by Lech Wałęsa to Donald Trump on March 3, 2025. Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/polish-cold-war-hero-walesa-writes-trump-expressing-horror-zelenskiy-spat-2025-03-03/](https://www.reuters.com/world/polish-cold-war-hero-walesa-writes-trump-expressing-horror-zelenskiy-spat-2025-03-03/)) reported that Wałęsa expressed his "horror" at a spat between Trump and Zelenskyy.

The Los Angeles Times ([https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-03-03/polish-democracy-hero-walesa-says-trump-treatment-of-zelensky-filled-him-with-horror](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-03-03/polish-democracy-hero-walesa-says-trump-treatment-of-zelensky-filled-him-with-horror)) also published an article on March 3, 2025, stating that Wałęsa criticized Trump's treatment of Zelensky. <image:6273>, <image:6274>, <image:6275>


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Lech Wałęsa wrote a letter to Donald Trump on March 3, 2025. The letter expressed Wałęsa's criticism of Trump's treatment of Zelenskyy. However, the provided sources do not explicitly mention the suspension of U.S. military aid to Ukraine as the primary focus of Wałęsa's criticism.

Therefore, while the claim is partially supported by the evidence, it is not entirely accurate. The evidence suggests that Wałęsa criticized Trump's actions related to Ukraine, but the specific reason for the criticism is not the suspension of military aid.

To fully verify the claim, information is missing regarding the exact content of Wałęsa's letter and whether it specifically addressed the suspension of U.S. military aid.

# Instructions
You just retrieved new Evidence. Now, **analyze the Claim's veracity using the evidence**. Always adhere to the following rules:
* Focus on developing new insights. Do not repeat larger parts from the Record. Do not restate the Claim.
* Write down your thoughts step-by-step. Whenever necessary, you may elaborate in more detail.
* Depending on the topic's complexity, invest one to three paragraphs. The fewer, the better.
* If you find that there is insufficient information to verify the Claim, explicitly state what information is missing.
* If you cite web sources, always refer to them by including their URL as a Markdown hyperlink.
* **Use information only from the recorded evidence**: Avoid inserting information that is not implied by the evidence. You may use commonsense knowledge, though.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "In early 2025, Ukraine and Russia had reached a peace deal in their years-long war."

## Actions
```
image_search("Ukraine Russia peace deal 2025")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
CNN published an image from June 2, 2025, in Istanbul, showing a meeting with flags of Russia, Turkey, and Ukraine. ([Source](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/02/europe/russia-ukraine-peace-talks-turkey-drone-attack-intl)) <image:6285> The Atlantic Council discusses a Putin-friendly peace deal. ([Source](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/a-putin-friendly-peace-deal-would-be-disastrous-for-global-security/)) <image:6289>

The search result contains an image of a meeting in Istanbul on June 2, 2025, with flags of Russia, Turkey, and Ukraine. ([Source](https://www.cfr.org/article/russia-and-ukraine-agree-prisoner-swap)) <image:6290>


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that there were meetings between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul in June 2025. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that a peace deal was reached in early 2025. The CNN article mentions peace talks, but it does not confirm a deal. The Atlantic Council discusses a potential peace deal, but it does not confirm that one was reached.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified based on the provided evidence. More information is needed to confirm whether a peace deal was reached in early 2025.


## Actions
```
image_search("Ukraine Russia peace deal early 2025")
```

## Evidence
No new evidence found.

## Elaboration
The evidence shows meetings took place in Istanbul in June 2025, involving Russia, Turkey, and Ukraine. However, the evidence does not confirm that a peace deal was reached in early 2025. The search for additional evidence did not yield any new information.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified due to a lack of explicit confirmation of a peace deal in early 2025.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence provides timelines and discussions related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, including the Minsk peace agreement. However, none of the evidence confirms that a peace deal was reached in early 2025. The search results show events from 2013-2015 and discussions about negotiations, but they do not provide any information about a peace deal in early 2025.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified.

**20 квітня американський телеканал Fox News під час прямої трансляції Великоднього богослужіння [Православної Церкви України](https://suspilne.media/tag/pcu/)
, яке відбувалося у Києві, позначив українську столицю як російське місто.**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

В ефірі [телеканал](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgJs88_Zhog)
 використав трансляцію Суспільне Культура.

Понад 20 хвилин телеканал транслював службу в українській столиці з підписом "Kyiv, Russia".

Після цього канал ще близько пів години транслював Великодню службу з Москви за участю глави Російської Православної Церкви патріарха Кіріла.

В **Міністерстві закордонних справ України** заявили, що телеканал має попросити вибачення за свою помилку та провести розслідування.

> "Якщо це була помилка, а не свідома політична заява, слід вибачитися та розслідувати, хто зробив помилку", — заявив речник МЗС Георгій Тихий.

Oroszország neve szerepelt Kijevé mellett az amerikai Fox News csatorna adásában, amelyben a különböző országok húsvéti ünnepségeit mutatták be, [írja](https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2025/04/20/7508362/)
 az Ukrajinszka Pravda. Többek között az orosz ortodox egyház ceremóniáját is bemutatták, amelyen Vlagyimir Putyin elnök is részt vett, majd nem sokkal később az ukránoké következett.

„Kijev, Ukrajna” – állt a felirat felvétel mellett, majd Ukrajnát egyszer csak kicserélték Oroszországra, amit aztán hosszabb ideig mutattak a képernyőn. Végül azért visszacsatolták Ukrajna fővárosát Ukrajnához.

Mindez jelentős felháborodást keltett az orosz agresszió áldozatául esett ország nyilvánosságában.

Fox news

Američka televizijska mreža **Fox News**, poznata po svojoj **pro-republikanskoj orijentaciji**, izazvala je val kritika i ogorčenja nakon što je na Uskrs emitirala **višeminutni prijenos pravoslavne mise** iz Rusije, na kojoj su prikazani **Vladimir Putin** i **patrijarh Kiril Gundjajev**. Tijekom više od **30 minuta emitiranja**, voditelji su Kijev nazvali “**ruskim gradom**“, što je izazvalo val negativnih reakcija u **Ukrajini**, ali i u **Sjedinjenim Američkim Državama**.

* * *

### **Kritike: “Legitimiziranje zločinaca” i “pranje imidža”**

Emitiranje mise s Putinom u prvom planu i patrijarhom Kirilom, koji je **otvoreno podržavao rusku agresiju na Ukrajinu**, mnogi su gledatelji i analitičari okarakterizirali kao **“legitimizaciju ubojica”**. Na društvenim mrežama zaredale su optužbe da **Fox News pokušava prikazati Putina kao uzornog kršćanina**, unatoč njegovim **neispunjenim obećanjima o uskrsnom primirju**, dok se u isto vrijeme nastavljaju **ruski napadi na ukrajinske gradove**.

* * *

### **Dvostruka mjerila i politička poruka?**

Komentatori su upozorili na **hipokriziju u pristupu**, budući da je televizijska kuća odlučila prikazivati **vjerski događaj** u režiji autokratskog režima, istovremeno **zanemarujući agresiju**, **civilne žrtve** i **ratna razaranja** koje taj isti režim provodi. Posebno je problematična izjava voditelja koji je **Kijev, [glavni grad](https://www.rijekadanas.com/pesut-na-skupstini-liste-za-rijeku-nas-glavni-grad-je-rijeka/)
 Ukrajine, nazvao ruskim gradom** – što je stav u potpunosti suprotan međunarodnom pravu i stajalištima većine zapadnih zemalja.

* * *

### **Reakcije iz Ukrajine**

Ukrajinski korisnici društvenih mreža, novinari i diplomati izrazili su **ogorčenje zbog emitiranja sadržaja koji potiče rusku propagandu**. Mnogi su podsjetili da patrijarh Kiril od početka rata **otvoreno blagoslivlja vojne operacije**, a da sam **Putin koristi vjerske događaje** kako bi prikrio političke i vojne ciljeve.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that Joe Rogan made statements about preferring to go to Russia over Canada. However, the exact wording of the claim is not entirely accurate. The Toronto Sun article indicates that Rogan's statement was specifically in the context of a UFC event in Canada. The Newsweek and Global News articles do not specify the context. The evidence does not provide the exact date of the statement, but the articles were published in March 2024.

Therefore, the claim is partially accurate, but the context and date need to be clarified.

The articles can be found here: [https://www.newsweek.com/joe-rogan-canada-ufc-russia-2049964](https://www.newsweek.com/joe-rogan-canada-ufc-russia-2049964), [https://globalnews.ca/news/11098769/joe-rogan-rather-go-to-russia-than-canada-ufc/](https://globalnews.ca/news/11098769/joe-rogan-rather-go-to-russia-than-canada-ufc/), and [https://torontosun.com/sports/mma/joe-rogan-would-rather-go-to-russia-than-ufc-event-in-canada-i-wont-be-there](https://torontosun.com/sports/mma/joe-rogan-would-rather-go-to-russia-than-ufc-event-in-canada-i-wont-be-there).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Joe Rogan made statements about preferring to go to Russia over Canada. However, the exact wording of the claim is not entirely accurate. The Toronto Sun article indicates that Rogan's statement was specifically in the context of a UFC event in Canada. The Newsweek and Global News articles do not specify the context. The evidence does not provide the exact date of the statement, but the articles were published in March 2024.

Therefore, the claim is partially accurate, but the context and date need to be clarified.


## Final Judgement
Joe Rogan did make statements about preferring to go to Russia over Canada. However, the context of the statement is not entirely clear, and the exact wording of the claim is not entirely accurate. The articles were published in March 2024, not March 2025.

The claim is partially accurate, but the context and date need to be clarified. `false`

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence does not support the claim. The search results provide images of Fauci and Putin, and mention the Russia-Ukraine war, but do not mention any extradition attempts or negotiations.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing.

## Actions
```

```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results from KVUE.com ([https://www.kvue.com/article/news/crime/jamie-white-murder-arrests-infowars/269-aa20c169-085c-4827-8e8c-ce8755a4b715](https://www.kvue.com/article/news/crime/jamie-white-murder-arrests-infowars/269-aa20c169-085c-4827-8e8c-ce8755a4b715)) contain images related to the murder investigation <image:6339>. Global News ([https://globalnews.ca/video/11078554/infowars-reporter-jamie-white-shot-dead-in-texas-parking-lot](https://globalnews.ca/video/11078554/infowars-reporter-jamie-white-shot-dead-in-texas-parking-lot)) has an image of Jamie White <image:6340>.

Fox 7 Austin ([https://www.fox7austin.com/news/infowars-writer-shooting-austin-police-jamie-white](https://www.fox7austin.com/news/infowars-writer-shooting-austin-police-jamie-white)) also has an image of Jamie White and images of two suspects <image:6341>.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Jamie White, an InfoWars reporter, was shot dead in Austin, Texas. However, the provided search results do not contain any information about White being on a Ukrainian enemies hit list.

Therefore, the claim's veracity cannot be determined based on the available evidence. Additional information is needed to verify the second part of the claim.


## Actions
```
image_search("Jamie White Ukrainian enemies hit list")
```

## Evidence
No new evidence found.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Jamie White, an InfoWars reporter, was shot dead in Austin, Texas. However, the search results do not contain any information about White being on a Ukrainian enemies hit list.

Since no evidence supports the second part of the claim, it cannot be verified.


## Final Judgement
The search results confirm that Jamie White was shot dead in Austin, Texas. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that he was on a Ukrainian enemies hit list. Therefore, the claim is not fully supported by the available information.

`false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim that Jamie White was shot dead in Austin, Texas is supported by evidence from multiple news sources, including KVUE.com, Global News, and Fox 7 Austin. However, there is no evidence from the search results to support the assertion that he was on a Ukrainian enemies hit list.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The PBS article discusses Volodymyr Zelenskyy's visit amid the Russian war. (<image:6356>) The Al Jazeera article from March 22, 2022, covers Zelenskyy renewing an offer of talks with Putin. (<image:6357>)

The NBC News article contains an image of Volodymyr Zelenskyy. (<image:6358>)


### Evidence from `image_search`
Al Jazeera published a timeline of the Russia-Ukraine war, including a map showing areas under Russian control as of August 24, 2022. [<image:6372>] The timeline is available at [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/8/24/timeline-six-months-of-russias-war-in-ukraine).

DW.com provides a timeline of the Ukraine crisis, noting that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy confirmed NATO membership as a strategic national goal in September 2020, and that Russia attacked Ukraine on February 24, 2022. [<image:6373>] The timeline can be found at [Source](https://www.dw.com/en/how-the-ukraine-russia-crisis-reached-a-tipping-point/a-60802626). Eurojust's response to the war in Ukraine is presented in a timeline that begins in February 2022. [<image:6374>] The timeline is available at [Source](https://www.eurojust.europa.eu/publication/one-year-timeline-eurojusts-response-war-ukraine).


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Russia attacked Ukraine on February 24, 2022. The timeline from DW.com shows that Zelenskyy confirmed NATO membership as a strategic national goal in September 2020. The Al Jazeera article from March 22, 2022, shows Zelenskyy renewing an offer of talks with Putin. There is no evidence to support the claim that Zelenskyy started the war.


## Final Judgement
The evidence provided, including timelines and news articles, indicates that Russia initiated the war in Ukraine in February 2022. There is no evidence to suggest that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy started the war.

`false`


## Summary

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence contradicts the claim. According to a Le Monde article, Biden pledged to aid victims of Hurricane Helene. The evidence does not mention any announcement about stopping aid for the affected areas.

_________________________



JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

Volodymyr Zelensky (left) and Joe Biden said they would focus on Ukraine's "victory plan" at their White House talks

Volodymyr Zelensky is meeting Joe Biden and Kamala Harris at the White House to discuss his "victory plan", which the Ukrainian president hopes will pressure Russia into agreeing a diplomatic end to the war.

Details have been kept secret, but Zelensky is likely to ask the US president and vice-president for continuing military and financial support, as well as security guarantees.

It comes amid a row with Donald Trump and the Republican party ahead of November's US presidential election.

They were angered by Zelensky's visit to an arms factory in Biden's hometown of Scranton with top Democrats. Zelensky will meet Trump on Friday despite earlier reports that the meeting had been cancelled.

Zelensky's visit to the ammunition factory in the key swing state of Pennsylvania was labelled by leading Republicans as a partisan campaign event.

In a public letter, speaker of the US House Mike Johnson said the visit was "designed to help Democrats" and claimed it amounted to "election interference".

He also demanded that Ukraine fire its ambassador to Washington who helped arrange the visit.

The Republican-led House Oversight Committee has also announced it would investigate whether Zelensky's trip was an attempt to use a foreign leader to benefit Harris's campaign.

Her Republican rival for the presidency, Donald Trump, mocked Zelensky at a campaign event as the "greatest salesman on Earth" and accused him of refusing to "make a deal" with Moscow.

Earlier this week, Trump also praised Russia's military capabilities, saying: "They beat Hitler, they beat Napoleon - that’s what they do, they fight."

The two men have long had a fractious relationship. In 2019, Trump was impeached by the US House over accusations that he pressured Ukraine's leader to dig up damaging information on a political rival.

The row clouded a week in which Zelensky has twice addressed the United Nations, ramping up efforts to persuade the US and other allies to boost support more than two and a half years into Russia's full-scale invasion.

At the White House meetings, Zelensky is expected to push again for US backing to fire Western-made long-range missiles deep into Russian territory, which Biden has so far blocked.

Before the meeting, Biden said: "Let me be clear, Russia will not prevail in war... Ukraine will prevail".

He also pledged to support Kyiv "in its path to membership to both the EU and Nato".

Meanwhile, Zelensky thanked the US for its "unwavering bipartisan support".

He later met Harris, with the vice-president reiterating her support for Ukraine and arguing the US must continue its role of global leadership.

With Russian troops advancing in the east of Ukraine, the outcome of Zelensky's meeting with Biden and Harris is seen by many experts as a key moment in his attempt to shore up US support before the November election.

On Wednesday, Russia's Vladimir Putin announced a plan to revise Moscow's nuclear doctrine, to enable Russia to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states if they are supported by nuclear states.

President Volodymyr Zelensky visited the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant alongside top Democrats on Friday

Hours before his meeting with Zelensky, Biden announced a $7.9bn (£5.9bn) package of military assistance to Ukraine.

The aid, part of a $61bn package that passed Congress in April, will be approved through presidential drawdown authority and will pull from existing Pentagon supplies to deliver the arms more quickly.

Congressional Republicans blocked the package for months earlier this year, before ultimately relenting and passing the legislation. The delay caused arms supplies to Ukraine to dry up for several months.

Zelensky thanked the US - Ukraine's largest foreign donor.

At the same time, he also reportedly expressed frustration at the delay in delivering weapons that were already promised when he met US congressmen on Thursday morning.

**Volodymyr Zelensky is meeting Joe Biden and Kamala Harris at the White House to discuss his "victory plan", which the Ukrainian president hopes will pressure Russia into agreeing a diplomatic end to the war.**

Details have been kept secret, but Zelensky is likely to ask the US president and vice-president for continuing military and financial support, as well as security guarantees.

It comes amid a row with Donald Trump and the Republican party ahead of November's US presidential election.

They were angered by Zelensky's visit to an arms factory in Biden's hometown of Scranton with top Democrats. Zelensky will meet Trump on Friday despite earlier reports that the meeting had been cancelled.

Zelensky's visit to the ammunition factory in the key swing state of Pennsylvania was labelled by leading Republicans as a partisan campaign event.

In a public letter, speaker of the US House Mike Johnson said the visit was "designed to help Democrats" and claimed it amounted to "election interference".

He also demanded that Ukraine fire its ambassador to Washington who helped arrange the visit.

The Republican-led House Oversight Committee has also announced it would investigate whether Zelensky's trip was an attempt to use a foreign leader to benefit Harris's campaign.

Her Republican rival for the presidency, Donald Trump, mocked Zelensky at a campaign event as the "greatest salesman on Earth" and accused him of refusing to "make a deal" with Moscow.

Earlier this week, Trump also praised Russia's military capabilities, saying: "They beat Hitler, they beat Napoleon - that’s what they do, they fight."

The two men have long had a fractious relationship. In 2019, Trump was impeached by the US House over accusations that he pressured Ukraine's leader to dig up damaging information on a political rival.

The row clouded a week in which Zelensky has twice addressed the United Nations, ramping up efforts to persuade the US and other allies to boost support more than two and a half years into Russia's full-scale invasion.

At the White House meetings, Zelensky is expected to push again for US backing to fire Western-made long-range missiles deep into Russian territory, which Biden has so far blocked.

Before the meeting, Biden said: "Let me be clear, Russia will not prevail in war... Ukraine will prevail".

He also pledged to support Kyiv "in its path to membership to both the EU and Nato".

Meanwhile, Zelensky thanked the US for its "unwavering bipartisan support".

He later met Harris, with the vice-president reiterating her support for Ukraine and arguing the US must continue its role of global leadership.

With Russian troops advancing in the east of Ukraine, the outcome of Zelensky's meeting with Biden and Harris is seen by many experts as a key moment in his attempt to shore up US support before the November election.

On Wednesday, Russia's Vladimir Putin announced a plan to revise Moscow's nuclear doctrine, to enable Russia to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states if they are supported by nuclear states.

Putin's spokesperson later clarified that it was meant as a "specific signal" to the West.

What was [Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky](https://nypost.com/2024/09/25/us-news/house-gop-accuses-kamala-harris-of-using-zelensky-as-campaign-surrogate-launches-foreign-interference-inquiry/)
 doing at what sure _looked_ like a partisan US political event this week?

And how did the White House let this happen?

Zelensky got flown into battleground Pennsylvania aboard a USAF C-17 plane on Tuesday; he then toured the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant accompanied by Gov. Josh Shapiro, Sen. Bob Casey, Rep. Matt Cartwright — the last two being active Democratic candidates.

And it looks like no GOP candidates got invited — trapping a foreign head of state into apparently taking sides in US domestic politics.

Yet Zelensky was guarded by Secret Service agents and driven around in Secret Service vehicles, adding more reek of impropriety: Who covered those expenses?

Someone in the Biden administration pulled a fast one: Pennsylvania has a fair number of anti-Russian Polish-Americans and others of Eastern European heritage who might be swayed by Zelensky’s seeming preference.

Legalities aside, this is terrible for Zelensky: Ukraine desperately needs support from Republicans as well as Democrats in Congress, and will no matter who holds the White House next year.

House Speaker Mike Johnson is calling on Zelensky to fire his US ambassador for letting this disgrace happen, a move that could mend _Ukraine’s_ fences here.

But Congress will need answers on the American side, too: After all, Democrats impeached President Donald Trump over _his_ supposed abuses linked to Ukraine; now we have the misuse of a foreign guest’s visit to influence US politics.

We absolutely endorse US support of Kyiv against Moscow’s brutal invasion: Vladimir Putin must not succeed.

And Democratic candidates have every right to slam those Republicans who want to hang Ukraine out to dry.

But dragging any foreign leader, _especially_ one who’s seeking now new support for his nation from the White House, into US politics is morally criminal — at least.

Whether at the White House or the State Department, _American_ heads need to roll over this."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that the image shows Zelenskyy signing artillery shells at the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant (SCAAP) in Pennsylvania. The evidence does not mention Israeli bombs or Gaza.

Therefore, the claim that the image shows Zelenskyy signing Israeli bombs intended for use against Palestinians in Gaza is not supported by the evidence.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence reveals that Ukraine has faced corruption issues, including officials stealing funds intended for arms purchases. However, the evidence does not provide any information about the amount of armaments sold by Ukraine, let alone the claim that it is half of the received armaments.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the provided evidence. More information is needed to assess the veracity of the claim.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States"

## Actions
```
image_search("Ukraine arms sales US aid")
image_search("Ukraine corruption arms sales")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include images of armaments and military equipment. One source is from CEPA.org and contains an image of armaments <image:6432>. Another source is from Stimson.org and contains an image of armaments being transported <image:6433>. ABC News also provides an image of military equipment <image:6436>.

The sources are: [https://cepa.org/article/what-the-us-is-sending-to-ukraine-right-now-and-what-it-isnt/](https://cepa.org/article/what-the-us-is-sending-to-ukraine-right-now-and-what-it-isnt/), [https://www.stimson.org/2022/u-s-military-assistance-to-ukraine/](https://www.stimson.org/2022/u-s-military-assistance-to-ukraine/), and [https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-military-nato-officials-discuss-weapons-sales-aid/story?id=123691237](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-military-nato-officials-discuss-weapons-sales-aid/story?id=123691237).


### Evidence from `image_search`
The New York Times published an article about a Ukrainian politician charged with corruption (<image:6509>). Bloomberg reports that Ukrainian officials stole $40 million meant to buy arms for the war with Russia (<image:6510>).

The provided sources are: [Source](https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2024/08/something-is-rotten-in-the-state-of-russian-arms-industry.html) and [Source](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/28/world/europe/ukraine-weapons-politician-charged-corruption.html) and [Source](https://www.bloomberg.com/en/news/thp/2024-01-28/ukraine-says-corrupt-officials-stole-40-million-meant-to-buy-arms-for-the-war-with-russia).


## Elaboration
The evidence reveals that Ukraine has faced corruption issues, including officials stealing funds intended for arms purchases. However, the evidence does not provide any information about the amount of armaments sold by Ukraine, let alone the claim that it is half of the received armaments.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the provided evidence. More information is needed to assess the veracity of the claim.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that the U.S. is a major provider of military hardware to Ukraine, and there are efforts to track the supplied gear. However, the evidence does not provide any data on the volume of arms sales by Ukraine.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified. The information about the amount of armaments sold by Ukraine is still missing.

The sources are: [https://www.voanews.com/a/us-personnel-tracking-american-supplied-gear-in-ukraine-/6819038.html](https://www.voanews.com/a/us-personnel-tracking-american-supplied-gear-in-ukraine-/6819038.html), [https://www.ifw-kiel.de/publications/news/ukraine-support-tracker-new-aid-drops-to-lowest-level-since-january-2022/](https://www.ifw-kiel.de/publications/news/ukraine-support-tracker-new-aid-drops-to-lowest-level-since-january-2022/), and [https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/11/world/europe/us-military-aid-ukraine.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/11/world/europe/us-military-aid-ukraine.html).


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the U.S. is a major provider of military hardware to Ukraine, and there are efforts to track the supplied gear. However, the evidence does not provide any data on the volume of arms sales by Ukraine.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified. The information about the amount of armaments sold by Ukraine is still missing.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence shows that the U.S. provides significant military aid to Ukraine, and there are efforts to track this aid. However, there is no information about Ukraine selling half of the armaments it receives.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include images of armaments and military equipment. One source is from CEPA.org and contains an image of armaments <image:6432>. Another source is from Stimson.org and contains an image of armaments being transported <image:6433>. ABC News also provides an image of military equipment <image:6436>.

The sources are: [https://cepa.org/article/what-the-us-is-sending-to-ukraine-right-now-and-what-it-isnt/](https://cepa.org/article/what-the-us-is-sending-to-ukraine-right-now-and-what-it-isnt/), [https://www.stimson.org/2022/u-s-military-assistance-to-ukraine/](https://www.stimson.org/2022/u-s-military-assistance-to-ukraine/), and [https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-military-nato-officials-discuss-weapons-sales-aid/story?id=123691237](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-military-nato-officials-discuss-weapons-sales-aid/story?id=123691237).


### Evidence from `image_search`
The New York Times published an article about a Ukrainian politician charged with corruption (<image:6509>). Bloomberg reports that Ukrainian officials stole $40 million meant to buy arms for the war with Russia (<image:6510>).

The provided sources are: [Source](https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2024/08/something-is-rotten-in-the-state-of-russian-arms-industry.html) and [Source](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/28/world/europe/ukraine-weapons-politician-charged-corruption.html) and [Source](https://www.bloomberg.com/en/news/thp/2024-01-28/ukraine-says-corrupt-officials-stole-40-million-meant-to-buy-arms-for-the-war-with-russia).


## Elaboration
The evidence reveals that Ukraine has faced corruption issues, including officials stealing funds intended for arms purchases. However, the evidence does not provide any information about the amount of armaments sold by Ukraine, let alone the claim that it is half of the received armaments.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the provided evidence. More information is needed to assess the veracity of the claim.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence provides information about the wealth of US politicians and US aid to Ukraine. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that the image is an authentic list released by Ukraine showing US politicians taking bribes from Ukraine. The provided sources discuss the wealth of politicians and US aid to Ukraine, but they do not mention any bribes or a list released by Ukraine.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available evidence. More information is needed to verify the authenticity of the list and the allegations of bribery.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

## Elaboration
The IMF published the World Economic Outlook in October 2024, which included economic forecasts. The evidence provides projections for Russia's real GDP growth in 2024, estimating a 3.8% growth. However, the evidence does not mention Russia's ranking among the world's largest economies.

The claim cannot be verified with the provided evidence because it does not contain information about Russia's economic ranking.

## Elaboration
The IMF published the World Economic Outlook in October 2024, which included economic forecasts. The evidence provides projections for Russia's real GDP growth in 2024, estimating a 3.8% growth. However, the evidence does not mention Russia's ranking among the world's largest economies.

The claim cannot be verified with the provided evidence because it does not contain information about Russia's economic ranking.

## Elaboration
The evidence shows that the IMF published economic forecasts in October 2024, including projections for Russia's GDP growth. However, the search for information about Russia's economic ranking in October 2024 did not yield any results. The provided image from Visual Capitalist, based on IMF data from October 2023, focuses on the fastest-growing economies and does not include information about the overall economic ranking of Russia.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified because the evidence does not provide any information about Russia's economic ranking in October 2024.


## Final Judgement
The IMF did publish economic forecasts in October 2024, including projections for Russia's GDP growth. However, the search for information about Russia's economic ranking in October 2024 did not yield any results. The evidence does not provide any information about Russia's economic ranking.

The claim is not supported by the evidence. The search results do not mention Russia's economic ranking. `false`


## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The fact-check reveals that while the IMF did release economic forecasts in October 2024, including projections for Russia's GDP growth, the provided evidence does not contain any information about Russia's economic ranking at that time. Therefore, the claim that the IMF declared Russia the fourth-largest economy in the world in October 2024 is not supported by the available evidence.

Renovated in 2018, the facility in Toropets is estimated to have stored tonnes upon tonnes of military goods, including explosives, artillery shells and ballistic missiles.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A Ukrainian drone attack on a significant Russian weapons stockpile in the Tver region in the early hours of Wednesday might be the Ukrainian army's biggest hit against Moscow's arsenal since early 2022.

The blast from the strike was so strong that earthquake monitoring stations picked it up as if it were a minor earthquake, while NASA reported a series of heat sources spotted by its equipment from space.

The facility in Toropets is estimated to have stored around 30,000 tonnes of military munitions. The destruction of the ammunition that was stored there will most likely negatively affect the northern operational group of the Russian army.

But what is the Russian military storage facility in Toropets and how important is it?

Renovated in 2018, the facility in Toropets is estimated to have stored tonnes upon tonnes of military goods, including explosives, artillery shells and ballistic missiles.

The former Russian deputy defence minister Dmitry Bulgakov — who was arrested earlier this year on corruption charges — said after the renovations that the site met the "highest international standards" and could defend weapons from missiles and "even a small nuclear attack".

The storage site covered an area of over 5 square kilometres in size and a perimeter of more than 12 kilometres long. 

**Which missiles were stored at the facility?**
-----------------------------------------------

The town of Toropets is situated around 470 kilometers north of the Ukrainian border and the destruction of the ammunition that was stored there will most likely negatively affect the northern operational group of the Russian army, including the supply of troops in Kursk, Belgorod and Bryansk.

According to Ukrainian sources, the military site in Toropets reportedly housed fuel tanks, as well as missiles intended for Iskander missile systems, Tochka-U missile systems, guided aerial bombs and assorted artillery ammunition.

The head of Ukraine's Centre for Countering Disinformation, Andriy Kovalenko, said that in addition to its own ammunition, Russia had also started to store North Korean munitions in Toropets.

Maxar satellite service collected imagery clearly shows the extent of the damage from the Ukrainian drone attack causing a series of explosions, according to a photo shared by the Russia Team Lead at the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). 

The imagery shows large pillars of smoke covering much of the area, while a closer look at the ammunition storage area indicates that fires continue to burn in and near some bunkers, ISW's George Barros added.

**Have the storage bunkers been destroyed?**
--------------------------------------------

Most of the ammunition is presumably stored underground, so the question is whether Ukraine used any drones that could have penetrated inside the bunkers.

A full damage assessment remains impossible due to the thick smoke above the site. However, the possible destruction of the bunkers might have also been the result of Moscow not respecting its own regulations by placing the bunkers too close together, for example.

While repeatedly calling on the West to lift the restrictions over the use of long-range missiles deep into Russian territory, Ukraine has been using its home-produced UAVs to strike as deep as 1,800 kilometres into Russia, as was the case in the city of Orsk.

LONDON, Sept 18 (Reuters) - A large-scale Ukrainian drone attack on Russia triggered an earthquake-sized blast at a major arsenal in the Tver region on Wednesday, forcing the evacuation of a nearby town, war bloggers and some media reported.

Unverified video and images on social media showed a huge ball of flame blasting into the night sky and multiple detonations thundering across a lake about 380 km (240 miles) west of Moscow.

 in the area.

"The enemy hit an ammunition depot in the area of Toropets," said Yuri Podolyaka, a Ukrainian-born, pro-Russian military blogger. "Everything that can burn is already burning there (and exploding)."

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, speaking in his nightly video address, hailed the outcome of the attack without referring specifically to the target.

"A very important result was achieved last night on Russian territory and such actions weaken the enemy," Zelenskiy said. "I thank everyone involved. Such precision is truly inspiring."

He thanked the SBU security service, the HUR intelligence service and the Special Operations Forces.

A source in Ukraine's SBU state security service had earlier told Reuters the drone attack had destroyed [a warehouse storing missiles](/world/europe/ukraine-destroyed-arsenal-russias-tver-region-kyiv-security-source-says-2024-09-18/)
, guided bombs and artillery ammunition.

Russian state media have in the past reported that a major arsenal for conventional weapons was located at the site of the blasts. State media, now subject to military censorship laws, was muted in its reporting on Wednesday.

Igor Rudenya, governor of the Tver region, said that Ukrainian drones had been shot down, that a fire had broken out and that some residents were being evacuated. He did not say what was burning.

One woman told Reuters that members of her family had been evacuated from Toropets.

"A fire started with explosions," said the woman, who identified herself only as Irina.

Rudenya later said the situation in Toropets was stable as of midday local time (0900 GMT) and that evacuated residents could return. The fire had been put out and there were no recorded fatalities, he said.

Russia and Ukraine each reported dozens of enemy drone attacks on their territory overnight, with Russian forces advancing in eastern [Ukraine](https://www.reuters.com/topic/event/ukraine-crisis/)
.

MAJOR EXPLOSION
---------------

The size of the main blast shown in the unverified social media video was consistent with 200-240 tons of high explosives detonating, said George William Herbert of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey in California.

A Toropets chatroom on the Russian social media site VK was flooded with messages of support from other parts of the country and offers of help to people fleeing the town.

Some people were asking whether buildings at specific addresses were still standing.

"People, does anyone know what's happened to Kudino village??? They told me nothing is left of our house," posted one woman.

Another woman replied: "It's horror there." Kudino is a village 4.5 km (2.8 miles) northeast of Toropets.

Some war bloggers asked how drones could trigger such large blasts at what was thought to be a highly fortified facility.

According to an RIA state news agency report from 2018, Russia was building an arsenal for the storage of missiles, ammunition and explosives in Toropets, a 1,000-year-old town, with a population of just over 11,000.

Dmitry Bulgakov, then a deputy defence minister, told RIA in 2018 that the facility could defend weapons from missiles and even a small nuclear attack. Bulgakov was arrested earlier this year on corruption charges, which he denies.

"It (the concrete facilities) ensures their reliable and safe storage, protects them from air and missile strikes and even from the damaging factors of a nuclear explosion," RIA quoted Bulgakov as saying at the time.

Some Russians on chat groups expressed anger.

"Why wasn't the ammunition underground?! What are you doing???? In Kudino, houses were blown away! Why is the forest burning and no one is there... What kind of negligence is this!!!!" one woman posted.

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian [drones struck a large military depot in a town deep inside Russia](https://apnews.com/article/poland-us-blinken-duda-ukraine-54232b14cae7785df02f9d48a77e7823)
 overnight, causing a huge fire and forcing some residents to evacuate, a Ukrainian official and Russian news reports said Wednesday. At least 13 people were injured, Russia’s Health Ministry added.

Meanwhile, a senior U.S. diplomat said [Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-kursk-incursion-gamble-battlefield-e862afd58c65d6d2d5b7b3747423ca4d)
 has a workable plan to end the war, now in its third year, although its details have not been publicly disclosed.

Ukraine claimed the strike destroyed military warehouses in Toropets, a town in Russia’s Tver region about 380 kilometers (240 miles) northwest of Moscow and about 500 kilometers (300 miles) from the border with Ukraine.

The attack was carried out by Ukraine’s Security Service, along with Ukraine’s Intelligence and Special Operations Forces, a Kyiv security official told The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the operation.

According to the official, the depot housed Iskander and Tochka-U missiles, as well as glide bombs and artillery shells. He said the facility caught fire in the strike and was burning across an area 6 kilometers (4 miles) wide.

Among the destroyed ammunition were North Korean KN-23 short-range ballistic missiles, another official, in Ukraine’s Intelligence Office, told AP. He also was not authorized to comment publicly and didn’t provide evidence to support his claim.

Russia and North Korea signed [a landmark pact](https://apnews.com/article/russia-putin-kim-north-korea-pact-556492779b6a32c4cf74b992741d91a8)
 in June that envisioned mutual military assistance between Moscow and Pyongyang.

More than 100 domestically produced exploding drones were deployed in the attack on the depot, the Ukrainian intelligence official added.

Russian state news agency RIA Novosti quoted regional authorities as saying air defense systems were working to repel a “massive drone attack” on Toropets, which has a population of about 11,000. The agency also reported a fire and the evacuations, and the Health Ministry said 13 people were hospitalized in the region after the attack.

Tver regional Gov. Igor Rudenya later said all evacuees could return home.

Successful Ukrainian strikes deep inside Russia have become more common as Kyiv developed its drone technology.

Zelenskyy also is seeking approval from Western nations for Ukraine to use the sophisticated weapons they are providing to hit targets inside Russia. Some Western leaders have balked at that, fearing they could be dragged into the conflict.

Part of Kyiv’s strategy is targeting of military equipment, ammunition and infrastructure deep inside Russia, as well as making civilians feel some of the consequences of the war that is being fought largely inside Ukraine.

The swift push by Ukrainian forces [into Russia’s Kursk border region](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-kursk-incursion-putin-1178b99b32b476816db3a48ffa06b11a)
 last month fits into that plan, which apparently seeks to compel Russian President Vladimir Putin to back down.

Putin, however, has shown no signs of that [and has been trying to grind down Ukraine’s resolve](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-putin-military-numbers-9c5554302486adfe7b3d69cb297f8a98)
 through attritional warfare and also sap the West’s support for Kyiv by drawing out the conflict. That has come at a price, however, as the U.K. Defense Ministry estimates the war has probably killed or wounded more than 600,000 Russian troops.

On Tuesday, Putin ordered the country’s military to [increase its number of troops](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-putin-military-numbers-9c5554302486adfe7b3d69cb297f8a98)
 by 180,000 to a total of 1.5 million by Dec. 1.

Zelenskyy announced his war plan in his nightly address on Monday, saying it’s 90% ready and will be presented to allies over the next week.

He said Ukraine’s [plan for victory](https://apnews.com/video/ukraine-government-kyiv-volodymyr-zelenskyy-ukraine-war-and-unrest-be06ac55f33246fd96f1898bac5a6884)
 includes not only battlefield goals but also diplomatic and economic wins. The plan has been kept under wraps but the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said at a news conference Tuesday that Washington officials have seen it.

“We think it lays out a strategy and a plan that can work,” she said, adding that the United States will bring it up with other world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly in New York next week. She did not comment on what the plan contained.

The depot, which stored an estimated 30,000 tonnes of military munitions, including explosives, artillery shells, and ballistic missiles, was struck on September 18, 2024. The articles, from Euronews ([https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/09/18/what-was-stored-at-the-russian-arms-depot-in-tver-region-struck-by-ukraines-drones](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/09/18/what-was-stored-at-the-russian-arms-depot-in-tver-region-struck-by-ukraines-drones)), Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-targets-western-russian-regions-with-drones-russian-officials-says-2024-09-18/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-targets-western-russian-regions-with-drones-russian-officials-says-2024-09-18/)), and the Associated Press ([https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-toropets-drones-attack-e3d05b2637d316b437e4789a35c7f59e](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-toropets-drones-attack-e3d05b2637d316b437e4789a35c7f59e)), describe the attack and its aftermath, including a large explosion and fire.

The depot housed missiles, glide bombs, artillery shells, and possibly North Korean KN-23 short-range ballistic missiles. The attack was carried out by Ukraine’s Security Service, along with Ukraine’s Intelligence and Special Operations Forces.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim that the image shows a Russian ammunition depot in Toropets, Tver Oblast, before and after a strike is partially supported by the evidence. The reverse image search confirms that the image depicts the depot and that it was struck. However, the evidence indicates that the attack was carried out by Ukraine, not NATO. The evidence does not mention a nuclear strike.

The evidence from the image search provides additional context, including articles from CNN, BBC News, and The Washington Post, which also discuss the attack on the Russian weapons depot.

Therefore, the claim is partially inaccurate. The location and the fact that the depot was struck are correct, but the claim incorrectly attributes the attack to NATO and suggests a nuclear strike.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

The Washington Post published an article with an image of a fire ([https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/09/18/ukraine-russia-blast-drones-missiles-tver/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/09/18/ukraine-russia-blast-drones-missiles-tver/)). <image:2746>, <image:2747>, <image:2748>


### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Bhutan': 0.24, 'China': 0.21, 'Malaysia': 0.13, 'Cambodia': 0.09, 'Ghana': 0.09, 'Taiwan': 0.07, 'Madagascar': 0.03, 'Nigeria': 0.02, 'Brazil': 0.01, 'Colombia': 0.01}

## Elaboration
The claim that the image shows a Russian ammunition depot in Toropets, Tver Oblast, before and after a strike is partially supported by the evidence. The reverse image search confirms that the image depicts the depot and that it was struck. However, the evidence indicates that the attack was carried out by Ukraine, not NATO. The evidence does not mention a nuclear strike.

The evidence from the image search provides additional context, including articles from CNN, BBC News, and The Washington Post, which also discuss the attack on the Russian weapons depot.

Therefore, the claim is partially inaccurate. The location and the fact that the depot was struck are correct, but the claim incorrectly attributes the attack to NATO and suggests a nuclear strike.


## Final Judgement
The image does show a Russian ammunition depot in Toropets, Tver Oblast, before and after an attack. However, the claim that the attack was a nuclear strike from NATO is false. The attack was carried out by Ukraine.

`false`

Some open-source estimates suggest that Ukraine had already lost nearly 40 Leopards, but those estimates are unconfirmed so far, according to the report. Russia repeatedly stated that arms supplies to Ukraine hinder the settlement and directly involve NATO countries in the conflict. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that the United States and NATO were directly involved in the conflict not only by providing weapons but also by training Ukrainian personnel in European countries.

Ukrainian Armed Forces destroyed in the Zaporozhye direction. Russian Defence Ministry / TASS

Moscow said Tuesday that it had captured several German Leopard tanks and U.S. Bradley infantry fighting vehicles, releasing footage showing Russian troops surveying the equipment supplied to Ukraine by Western countries.

"Leopard tanks and Bradley infantry fighting vehicles. These are our trophies. Equipment of the Ukrainian armed forces in the Zaporizhzhia region," the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement.

"Servicemen of the Vostok group inspect enemy tanks and infantry fighting vehicles captured in battle."

Kyiv has appealed to its allies in the West to deliver a broad range of modern military equipment to help Ukrainian forces recapture large swathes of territory controlled by Russian forces.

The Defense Ministry said several of the captured vehicles had working engines, suggesting that the battles they were involved in had been short and that Ukrainian troops had "fled" their offensive positions.

**(DEFENCE SECURITY ASIA) — During the week of May 11 to 17, Russian military claimed to have successfully destroyed five Leopard 2A1 tanks, manufactured by the German company Krauss-Maffei but donated to the Ukrainian Armed Forces to help the Eastern Europe country in its armed conflict with Russia.**

**In addition to the Leopard tanks, the Russian Ministry of Defense also alleged that 13 armored vehicles, 55 various vehicles, “Grad” multiple rocket launcher systems, and 47 artillery units—22 of which were supplied by foreign countries—were destroyed during this period.**

**Moreover, four Mi-24 helicopters and 40 unmanned boats belonging to the Ukrainian military were reportedly destroyed by Russia in the same timeframe.**

**Among the foreign-supplied armored vehicles to Ukraine, the Leopard tanks have been the most frequently supplied to Kyiv compared to other models such as the American-made Abrams and the British-made Challengers.**

**Since last year, countries such as Germany and several other European nations have supplied between 100-200 Leopard tanks to Ukraine for use in a spring counteroffensive against Russian positions.**

**“Russian Soldiers Pose in Front of Captured Leopard 2A6 Tank”**

**Line of Leopard tanks and Bradley armoured infantry fighting vehicle were destroyed in Zaphorizia, southern Ukraine.**

**Although the Ukrainian counteroffensive in 2023 initially started well, it faced increasingly formidable opposition from Russian forces who began altering their tactics and strategies.**

**These changes in strategy and tactics by the Russian forces led to the destruction of many of the Ukrainian tanks that had been supplied by donor countries like Germany, other European nations, the United States, and Britain.**

**However, to date, no one knows exactly how many Leopard tanks have been destroyed by Russia.**

**Nevertheless, Russian President Vladimir Putin has reportedly stated to his country’s war correspondents that Ukraine has lost more than 160 tanks supplied by foreign countries.**

**Given the high volume of Leopard tanks supplied to Ukraine, it is logical to conclude that many of the tanks destroyed by Russia were Leopard models.**

**Regarding the Abrams tanks, the Russian military stated that of the 31 American-made tanks supplied to Ukraine, more than five of the tanks have been destroyed by Russian forces.**

**A charred M1A1 Abrams main battle tank being transported to Moscow to participate in an exhibition at Victory Park.**

 **As a result of the destruction of five Abrams tanks, the United States has reportedly “withdrawn” these tanks from the Ukrainian battlefield, likely in an effort to “preserve its reputation.”**

**Following the destruction experienced by Leopard tanks supplied by Germany and other European countries, Ukraine’s Deputy Foreign Minister Andii Melnyk has requested that Kiev be supplied with more Leopard tanks, including the latest variant, the Leopard 2A6.**

 **However, the newest Leopard 2A6 variant supplied to Ukraine has met the same fate.**

**The Russian military reported capturing the most powerful tank in the Ukrainian arsenal, the German-made Leopard 2A6, after intense fighting in Avdiivka, Ukraine, last April.**

**It is believed that Ukraine possesses 21 Leopard 2A6 tanks, with 18 of these tanks developed by the companies Krauss-Maffei Wegmann and Rheinmetall being donated by Germany, while the remainder were provided by Portugal.**

**However, most of these Leopard 2A6 tanks donated to the Ukrainian military could not be used after failing to be properly maintained and remained inoperable as claimed by a senior German politician last January.**

**An Abrams tank caught fire after being struck by a Lancet kamikaze drone and an RPG from Russian forces.**

**According to Russian military sources, after capturing and removing the tank from the combat area, Russian forces transported the tank and sent it to Moscow, possibly for research purposes.**

**The Leopard 2A6 was successfully captured after a Russian platoon executed an ambush that caused the Ukrainian tank crew to abandon the German-made vehicle.**

**The Leopard 2A6 represents an upgrade from the Leopard 2A5, incorporating enhanced armor protection, firepower, and electronic warfare capabilities.**

**The tank measures 9.97 meters in length and weighs 62.3 tons, making it one of the heaviest main battle tanks ever deployed, with an engine power of 1,500 horsepower.**

**Capable of speeds up to 75 km/h and with an operational range of 500 km, it is equipped with a Rheinmetall 120 mm L/55 cannon, allowing it to fire all standard NATO ammunition types, including APFSDS, HEAT, and multi-purpose shells.**

**The Leopard 2A6 also features dual 7.62 mm MG3A1 machine guns and an advanced fire control system including a laser rangefinder, thermal imaging, and a ballistic computer. — DSA**

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
