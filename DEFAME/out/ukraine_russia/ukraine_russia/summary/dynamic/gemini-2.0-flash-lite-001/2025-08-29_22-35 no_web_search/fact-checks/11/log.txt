Useful result: From [Source](https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-new-fakes-on-zelenskyys-purported-wealth/a-69552392): 
Content: The search result from DW.com states that the claim about Zelenskyy's wife buying a Bugatti is fake. <image:6173> The image shows a social media post claiming French journalists obtained an invoice for a car purchase by Zelenskaya. The car's base price was almost 4 million euros, with an additional 500,000 euros for options, and it is to be received in 2026.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c72ver6172do): 
Content: The BBC News article contains an image of a Bugatti invoice addressed to "Mrs. Olena Zelenska" with a delivery address in Paris. The invoice is marked with "FALSE" and the total vehicle price is $4,462,400.00. <image:6174>

The claim 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's wife bought a $5,000,000.00 Bugatti while vacationing in Paris.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. Evidence from image searches, including a DW.com search result and a BBC News article, debunk the claim. The BBC News article includes an image of a Bugatti invoice addressed to "Mrs. Olena Zelenska" marked with "FALSE."

So, the overall veracity is: false
