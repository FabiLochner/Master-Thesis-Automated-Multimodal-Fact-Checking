Useful result: From [Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/davos-nato-chief-rutte-reaffirms-need-step-up-support-ukraine-2025-01-23/): 
Content: Reuters published an article on January 23, 2025, featuring an image of Mark Rutte <image:6219>. The article discusses Rutte's reaffirmation of the need to step up support for Ukraine.

The claim 'After Donald Trump won the US presidential election in 2024, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said that ‘If Trump surrenders Ukraine to Putin, he will personally expel the United States from the alliance’.' is false.
Justification: The provided search results, including images from sources like [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/07/14/nx-s1-5467272/russia-ukraine-war-trump-nato-weapons-tariffs), [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/International/russia-launches-136-drones-ukraine-ahead-expected-trump/story?id=123729140), [Politico](https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2025/07/trump-sends-weapons-ukraine-pro-00451109), and [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/davos-nato-chief-rutte-reaffirms-need-step-up-support-ukraine-2025-01-23/), do not contain any evidence to support the claim that Mark Rutte made the specific statement about Donald Trump, Ukraine, and NATO.

So, the overall veracity is: false
