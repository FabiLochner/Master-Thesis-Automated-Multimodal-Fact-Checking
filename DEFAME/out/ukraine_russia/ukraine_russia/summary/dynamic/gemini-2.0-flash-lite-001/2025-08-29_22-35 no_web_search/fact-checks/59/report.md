## Elaboration
The evidence provides information about the wealth of US politicians and US aid to Ukraine. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that the image is an authentic list released by Ukraine showing US politicians taking bribes from Ukraine. The provided sources discuss the wealth of politicians and US aid to Ukraine, but they do not mention any bribes or a list released by Ukraine.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available evidence. More information is needed to verify the authenticity of the list and the allegations of bribery.


## Final Judgement
The evidence includes articles and images about the wealth of US politicians and US aid to Ukraine. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that the image is an authentic list released by Ukraine showing US politicians taking bribes. The sources do not mention any bribes or a list released by Ukraine.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE
