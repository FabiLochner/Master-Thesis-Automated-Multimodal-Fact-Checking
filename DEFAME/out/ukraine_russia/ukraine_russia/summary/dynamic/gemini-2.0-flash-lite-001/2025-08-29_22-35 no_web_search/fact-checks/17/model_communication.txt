The evidence suggests that Warren Buffett's son, Howard Buffett, has been involved in providing aid to Ukraine. However, the evidence does not provide any information about the amount of money Warren Buffett has personally donated to Ukraine.

The Reuters article mentions Warren Buffett warning against Ukraine fatigue, which implies his concern for the ongoing situation, but it does not confirm any specific donations.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available information. The amount of money Warren Buffett has given to Ukraine since 2022 is not mentioned in the provided evidence.

The search results include a CNBC article with no content ([Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/13/buffetts-son-donates-2point7-million-to-ukraine-after-zelenskyy-meeting.html)). A Yahoo News article features an image of Howard Buffett, Warren Buffett's son, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (<image:6232>) ([Source](https://news.yahoo.com/warren-buffets-son-howard-given-115843841.html)).

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Warren Buffett's son, Howard Buffett, has been involved in providing aid to Ukraine. However, the evidence does not provide any information about the amount of money Warren Buffett has personally donated to Ukraine.

The Reuters article mentions Warren Buffett warning against Ukraine fatigue, which implies his concern for the ongoing situation, but it does not confirm any specific donations.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available information. The amount of money Warren Buffett has given to Ukraine since 2022 is not mentioned in the provided evidence.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The new evidence provides links to OPB, PBS.org, and Al Jazeera, which report on a "heated argument" or "fiery meeting" between Trump and Zelenskyy in the White House in February 2025. However, none of the provided sources contain the specific quote attributed to Zelenskyy in the claim.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified. The exact statements made during the meeting are still needed to confirm the claim's veracity.

The articles can be found here: [Source](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/09/kamala-harris-poland-ukraine-00015873), [Source](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/21/us/politics/zelensky-speech-transcript.html), and [Source](https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/19/politics/harris-munich-speech).


## Elaboration
The new evidence provides links to articles about Kamala Harris's speeches regarding Ukraine. However, none of the provided sources contain the specific quote from the claim.

To verify the claim, I would need to find the exact speech transcript or recording where Kamala Harris made the statement.


## Actions
```
image_search("Kamala Harris speech Ukraine Russia transcript exact quote")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/feb/17/kamala-harris-trump-russia-congress-ukraine-israel-palestinians): 
Content: The Guardian published an article about Kamala Harris and includes an image of her. <image:6316>


## Elaboration
The evidence does not contain the exact quote attributed to Kamala Harris in the claim. The search results provide articles and images related to her speeches on Ukraine and Russia, but none of them include the specific statement. Therefore, I cannot verify the claim.


## Final Judgement
The search results confirm that Kamala Harris has spoken about Ukraine and Russia. However, the provided evidence does not contain the exact quote attributed to her in the claim. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified. `false`


## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim cannot be verified. While Kamala Harris has spoken about Ukraine and Russia, the provided evidence, including articles from NBC News, NPR, Al Jazeera, Politico, The New York Times, CNN, and The Guardian, does not contain the specific quote attributed to her in the claim.

Content: Noozhawk published an image of a plane. <image:6330>


## Elaboration
The new evidence from Noozhawk ([Source](https://www.noozhawk.com/bidens-arrive-for-santa-ynez-valley-vacation/)) shows an image of a plane, but it does not show Joe Biden boarding a plane in August 2024. Therefore, the claim that Biden boarded an empty plane after the freed Americans exited cannot be verified. The evidence does not provide any information about Biden boarding a plane.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence includes articles from Al Jazeera, The Guardian, and NDTV, all mentioning Elon Musk. However, none of the provided sources explicitly state that Elon Musk posted on X in February 2025 about suspending Volodymyr Zelenskyy's account. The NDTV article shows an image of both Musk and Zelenskyy, but it does not confirm the claim.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available information.

**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`

The Guardian published an article on June 17, 2025, with an image of Elon Musk (<image:6343>) ([Source](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jun/17/elon-musk-new-york-hate-lawsuit-speech-law)).

## Elaboration
The evidence includes articles from Al Jazeera, The Guardian, and NDTV, all mentioning Elon Musk. However, none of the provided sources explicitly state that Elon Musk posted on X in February 2025 about suspending Volodymyr Zelenskyy's account. The NDTV article shows an image of both Musk and Zelenskyy, but it does not confirm the claim.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available information.


## Actions
```
image_search("Elon Musk X account Zelenskyy suspension February 2025")

## Evidence
No new evidence found.

## Elaboration
The search did not yield any new evidence. The previous search results did not confirm the claim.

Insufficient information is available to verify the claim.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.

You just retrieved new Evidence. Now, **analyze the Claim's veracity using the evidence**. Always adhere to the following rules:
* Focus on developing new insights. Do not repeat larger parts from the Record. Do not restate the Claim.
* Write down your thoughts step-by-step. Whenever necessary, you may elaborate in more detail.
* Depending on the topic's complexity, invest one to three paragraphs. The fewer, the better.
* If you find that there is insufficient information to verify the Claim, explicitly state what information is missing.
* If you cite web sources, always refer to them by including their URL as a Markdown hyperlink.
* **Use information only from the recorded evidence**: Avoid inserting information that is not implied by the evidence. You may use commonsense knowledge, though.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "Half of all US aid to Ukraine was laundered and sent back to Democrat candidates for re-election."

## Actions
```
image_search("US aid Ukraine laundered Democrat candidates")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
Reuters published an article on April 20, 2024, about the US House vote on a Ukraine aid package, which includes an image of a Ukrainian flag and an American flag in front of the Capitol Building (<image:6359>). The New York Times published an article about Andriy Derkach (<image:6361>).

A Politico article about Johnson on Ukraine aid stopgap was also found, but the content is not available.


## Elaboration
The evidence does not contain any information about the claim that half of the US aid to Ukraine was laundered and sent back to Democrat candidates. The search results mention a Reuters article about the US House vote on a Ukraine aid package and a New York Times article about Andriy Derkach. However, neither of these articles provides any details about the alleged laundering or the involvement of Democrat candidates.

The Politico article about Johnson on Ukraine aid stopgap is not available.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the provided evidence.


## Actions

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence provides information about US aid to Ukraine, including oversight and accountability measures. The Institute for the Study of War states that US oversight is extensive, and Ukrainian government oversight is growing. CIPE published a report on corruption risks in humanitarian aid in Ukraine. However, none of the provided sources support the claim that half of the US aid was laundered and sent to Democrat candidates. The CEPA article includes an image of Zelenskyy with McConnell and Schumer, but it does not mention any financial misconduct.

The claim remains unverified due to the lack of evidence supporting the alleged laundering and the involvement of Democrat candidates.

===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The fact-check reveals that while there is information about US aid to Ukraine, including oversight and corruption risks, there is no evidence to support the claim that half of the aid was laundered and sent to Democrat candidates. The search results include articles and reports about US assistance to Ukraine, but none of them mention the alleged laundering or the involvement of Democrat candidates.

Therefore, the claim is `not enough information`.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "Half of all US aid to Ukraine was laundered and sent back to Democrat candidates for re-election."

## Actions
```
image_search("US aid Ukraine laundered Democrat candidates")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
Reuters published an article on April 20, 2024, about the US House vote on a Ukraine aid package, which includes an image of a Ukrainian flag and an American flag in front of the Capitol Building (<image:6359>). The New York Times published an article about Andriy Derkach (<image:6361>).

A Politico article about Johnson on Ukraine aid stopgap was also found, but the content is not available.


## Elaboration
The evidence does not contain any information about the claim that half of the US aid to Ukraine was laundered and sent back to Democrat candidates. The search results mention a Reuters article about the US House vote on a Ukraine aid package and a New York Times article about Andriy Derkach. However, neither of these articles provides any details about the alleged laundering or the involvement of Democrat candidates.

The Politico article about Johnson on Ukraine aid stopgap is not available.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the provided evidence.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence reveals that the US has provided substantial aid to Ukraine. While there are reports of corruption within Ukraine's defense sector, and the US is the largest donor of military aid, there is no evidence to support the claim that half of the US aid was laundered and sent to Democrat candidates. The provided sources focus on the amount of aid, oversight, and corruption risks, but they do not mention any financial misconduct involving US aid being diverted to political campaigns. Therefore, the claim remains unsubstantiated.

The provided sources are: [https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/fact-sheet-us-assistance-ukraine](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/fact-sheet-us-assistance-ukraine), [https://www.cipe.org/resources/corruption-risk-assessment-humanitarian-aid-in-ukraine/](https://www.cipe.org/resources/corruption-risk-assessment-humanitarian-aid-in-ukraine/), and [https://www.ibanet.org/Russia-Ukraine-US-aid-delay-critical-as-country-looks-to-boost-frontline-fight](https://www.ibanet.org/Russia-Ukraine-US-aid-delay-critical-as-country-looks-to-boost-frontline-fight).


### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://cepa.org/article/ignore-the-noise-congress-can-still-pass-ukraine-aid/): 
Content: CEPA published an article that includes an image of Zelenskyy with McConnell and Schumer (<image:6371>).


## Elaboration
The evidence provides information about US aid to Ukraine, including oversight and accountability measures. The Institute for the Study of War states that US oversight is extensive, and Ukrainian government oversight is growing. CIPE published a report on corruption risks in humanitarian aid in Ukraine. However, none of the provided sources support the claim that half of the US aid was laundered and sent to Democrat candidates. The CEPA article includes an image of Zelenskyy with McConnell and Schumer, but it does not mention any financial misconduct.

The claim remains unverified due to the lack of evidence supporting the alleged laundering and the involvement of Democrat candidates.


## Actions
```
image_search("Ukraine aid corruption investigation")
image_search("US aid to Ukraine political donations")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/2/ukraine-says-defence-sector-corruption-scheme-uncovered): 
Content: Al Jazeera published an article about a corruption scheme uncovered in Ukraine's defense sector. <image:6375>


### Evidence from `image_search`
The BBC published an article on February 21, 2023, about the largest donors of military aid to Ukraine, with the US being the largest donor, providing $46.6 billion (<image:6381>). ABC News published a fact-check on Trump's claims about the amount of US aid to Ukraine, including a graphic from the Kiel Institute for the World Economy showing government support for Ukraine by the numbers (<image:6383>). PBS published an article about US aid to Ukraine, which includes a chart showing the amount of aid provided by the US and other countries (<image:6384>). None of the sources mention the claim that half of the US aid to Ukraine was laundered and sent back to Democrat candidates.


## Elaboration
The evidence reveals that the US has provided substantial aid to Ukraine. While there are reports of corruption within Ukraine's defense sector, and the US is the largest donor of military aid, there is no evidence to support the claim that half of the US aid was laundered and sent to Democrat candidates. The provided sources focus on the amount of aid, oversight, and corruption risks, but they do not mention any financial misconduct involving US aid being diverted to political campaigns. Therefore, the claim remains unsubstantiated.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that while there is evidence of US aid to Ukraine and discussions about corruption risks, there is no evidence to support the claim that half of the US aid was laundered and sent back to Democrat candidates. The provided sources focus on the amount of aid, oversight, and corruption risks, but they do not mention any financial misconduct involving US aid being diverted to political campaigns.

`false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is unsupported by the evidence. While the US has provided significant aid to Ukraine, and there are discussions about corruption risks, there is no evidence to suggest that half of the aid was laundered and sent to Democrat candidates. The search results include articles about US aid, corruption in Ukraine, and the amounts of aid provided by different countries, such as the BBC's article on the largest donors of military aid to Ukraine ([https://www.bbc.com/news/world-64726596](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-64726596)), but none of them support the specific claim.

Top political, business and sporting figures reeling from their offshore banking activities making the front pages of newspapers around the world got a backhanded boost from an unlikely source on Wednesday.

French satire magazine "Charlie Hebdo" depicted a caricatured group of cigar-smoking people holding signs reading "Je suis Panama," "Don't be afraid," and "They won't change our way of life."

Headlined "Tax Terrorism," the cover recycled many of the declarations of solidarity made following the terrorist attack at the French magazine in January 2015 that killed 11 people. The French phrase "Je suis," or "I am," followed by a city name after terrorist attacks or by a social cause has gone on to be used on social media on several occasions.

Je suis Panama was not the only time the Paris-based magazine recently grabbed attention. An [editorial published in last week's edition](https://charliehebdo.fr/en/edito/how-did-we-end-up-here/)
 was widely regarded as blaming all Muslims for Islamist terrorism. The magazine's cover, addressing the Brussels terror attacks, also came under fire.

**Russian propaganda continues to exploit the topic of fake covers of Western publications, which mock Ukraine or the Ukrainian leadership in the form of caricatures. For example, the other day, the cover of the French humorous publication Charlie Hebdo actively went viral in the Russian segment of Telegram – such a post was spread by one of the top Russian propaganda channels “Ukropsky Fresh” ([https://surl.li/kcqnza](//surl.li/kcqnza)
), the anti-Ukrainian resource “Drugaya Ukraina” ([https://surli.cc/blivly](//surli.cc/blivly)
), as well as the Kremlin’s top propagandist Solovyov ([https://surl.li/ksrqfa](//surl.li/ksrqfa)
). Further in the material about why it is fake.**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Fake**

As already noted, Russian propaganda actively exploits the topic of mocking Ukraine, Ukrainians and the leadership of the Ukrainian state through fake covers of famous Western publications. This time, the cover of Charlie Hebdo magazine has been falsified.

[![](//i0.wp.com/without-lie.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/home/dr343163/without-lie.info/www/shar2-3.jpg?resize=708%2C592&ssl=1)](//i0.wp.com/without-lie.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/home/dr343163/without-lie.info/www/shar2-3.jpg?ssl=1)

The cover, which was distributed by Russian propaganda Telegram channels, depicts a caricature of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is allegedly lying in a coffin. The cover contains a humiliating inscription, namely: “A political corpse is taking its last breath,” and the phrase “Ukraine is an independent state” is supposedly flying from the image of Zelensky himself.

However, Charlie Hebdo did not publish such an issue of the magazine with such a cover. This is stated in the information on the publication’s website.

Thus, the fake cover allegedly contains the magazine’s release date – March 20, 2025 and the serial number of the magazine – 1705.

[![](//i0.wp.com/without-lie.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/home/dr343163/without-lie.info/www/anh2-1.jpg?resize=708%2C593&ssl=1)](//i0.wp.com/without-lie.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/home/dr343163/without-lie.info/www/anh2-1.jpg?ssl=1)

However, Charlie Hebdo did not publish a magazine on March 20 with such a number. The last issue of the magazine that was published was No. 1704 for March 19, 2025 ([https://surl.li/qgqsaf](//surl.li/qgqsaf)
). The content of the cover is also different – ​​the real first page shows a caricature of French President Emmanuel Macron and the message – “Macron: He needs a good war”.

[![](//i0.wp.com/without-lie.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/home/dr343163/without-lie.info/www/anh3.jpg?resize=708%2C593&ssl=1)](//i0.wp.com/without-lie.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/home/dr343163/without-lie.info/www/anh3.jpg?ssl=1)

In another period, a magazine with an anti-Ukrainian cover could not be published either, because the magazine’s frequency of publication is once a week. So, the previous 1703rd issue was published on March 12, 2025 ([https://surl.li/srmwfu](//surl.li/srmwfu)
), and the 1702nd – on March 5, 2025 ([https://surli.cc/tefpcg](//surli.cc/tefpcg)
).

[![](//i0.wp.com/without-lie.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/home/dr343163/without-lie.info/www/shar3-2.jpg?resize=708%2C417&ssl=1)](//i0.wp.com/without-lie.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/home/dr343163/without-lie.info/www/shar3-2.jpg?ssl=1)

In addition, the upcoming issue of the magazine cannot contain a caricature of the president of Ukraine either – both the original cover and the fake one have an image of the announcement of the next issue of the magazine and its cover in the upper corner. And it has a completely different picture.

Accordingly, it can be stated that the publication in Russian Telegram channels of the cover of Charlie Hebdo magazine with a caricature of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is a fake. It was falsified based on the real cover of the publication, which was published on March 19, 2025.

In terms of content, this fake is aimed at humiliating and discrediting the Ukrainian president, who allegedly has no political future, and his dreams of an independent Ukraine are unattainable.

 claiming to be the cover of a weekly issue of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. The image shows a deceased Volodymyr Zelenskyy lying in a coffin with inscriptions in French. However, in versions shared by two accounts, the text was translated into English. According to the alleged cover, the Ukrainian president says from the coffin, “Ukraine is an independent state.” The image also includes a date – March 20, 2025 – as the release date of the magazine issue.

**A fake Charlie Hebdo cover is being spread on Facebook. In reality, no such cartoon can be found on the publication’s official website. Moreover, Charlie Hebdo did not release a new issue on March 20.**

Charlie Hebdo publishes magazines weekly, mainly on Wednesdays. Notably, in March 2025, the magazine [released](https://charliehebdo.fr/editions/)
 four issues – March 5, 12, 19, and 26 – with covers that were entirely different from the image circulating on Facebook. Consequently, the alleged issue date is also falsified, as the satirical magazine did not publish any issue on March 20. The photo circulated on Facebook features a serial number of the issue – 1705, which [matches](https://charliehebdo.fr/editions/1705/)
 the actual issue published on March 26.

[![Charlie Hebdo](https://mythdetector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-08-154422.png "Screenshot 2025 04 08 154422 | mythdetector.com")](https://mythdetector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-08-154422.png)

. Their report highlights that this photo fabrication was [posted](https://t.me/SolovievLive/315774)
 by Russian propagandist journalist Vladimir Solovyov on his Telegram channel on March 22. It is noteworthy that after this, the fake cover photo, translated into Italian from Solovyov’s post, was actively shared by Italian-speaking users on social media.

Since Russia invaded Ukraine and started a full-scale war on February 24, 2022, the forging of magazine covers to discredit Ukraine or its leaders has become an active part of Russian disinformation campaigns. Myths Detector has identified [many](https://mythdetector.com/en/fabricated-caricature-of-charlie-hebdo-about-the-missile-that-fell-in-poland/)

===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that Donald Trump was interviewed by Theo Von, as indicated by multiple sources ([nsnews.com](https://www.nsnews.com/local-news/theo-von-vancouver-donald-trump-interview-2024-9379843), [independent.co.uk](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-cocaine-theo-von-podcast-b2599472.html), [foxnews.com](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-talks-cocaine-biden-health-care-interview-comedian-theo-von)).

Reuters ([Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/uks-starmer-discussed-tough-fair-ukraine-peace-deal-with-trump-2025-02-27/)) features an image of Donald Trump and Keir Starmer shaking hands <image:6461>. CNN ([Source](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/27/politics/trump-starmer-security-guarantees-analysis)) published an article discussing Donald Trump and Keir Starmer <image:6462>.

NBC News ([Source](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/keir-starmer-sees-value-trumps-pursuit-ukrainian-mineral-rights-deal-rcna194047)) provides an image of Donald Trump shaking hands with an individual <image:6463>.

The evidence confirms that Donald Trump was interviewed by Theo Von, as indicated by multiple sources ([nsnews.com](https://www.nsnews.com/local-news/theo-von-vancouver-donald-trump-interview-2024-9379843), [independent.co.uk](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-cocaine-theo-von-podcast-b2599472.html), [foxnews.com](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-talks-cocaine-biden-health-care-interview-comedian-theo-von)). The search results also show images of Donald Trump with Keir Starmer ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/uks-starmer-discussed-tough-fair-ukraine-peace-deal-with-trump-2025-02-27/), [cnn.com](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/27/politics/trump-starmer-security-guarantees-analysis), [nbcnews.com](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/keir-starmer-sees-value-trumps-pursuit-ukrainian-mineral-rights-deal-rcna194047)).

However, the evidence does not specify the content of the interview, particularly whether Trump criticized Keir Starmer over a deal between the U.K. and Ukraine.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified without additional information about the interview's content.

The evidence contains an image of Vladimir Putin from CNN. However, the evidence does not provide any information about Putin declaring war on the United States.

Therefore, I cannot verify the claim. I need more information to determine the veracity of the claim.


## Actions
```
image_search("Putin war declaration United States")
```

## Evidence
No new evidence found.

## Elaboration
The evidence consists of an image of Vladimir Putin and a search query that did not yield any results. This is insufficient to verify the claim. The search results do not provide any information about Putin declaring war on the United States.

I am unable to verify the claim due to the lack of relevant information.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The search results provide an image of Vladimir Putin but no information about a declaration of war against the United States. Further searches also did not yield any relevant results.

The claim cannot be verified due to the lack of evidence. `not enough information`

An F-16 Fighting Falcon rests inside a warehouse near March Air Reserve Base after crashing on May 16, 2019. The missiles on board did not explode. The plane suffered a loss of hydraulic pressure, rendering the pilot unable to control the jet, the U.S. Air Force said April 23, 2020. (Courtesy of U.S. Air Force)

The U.S. Air Force has answered a questioned that burned in people’s minds as bystanders were hurriedly pushed back to safer locations several times and the 215 Freeway was closed after [the crash of an Air National Guard F-16 fighter jet](https://www.pressenterprise.com/2019/05/16/plane-crashes-near-march-air-reserve-base-215-freeway-shut-down/)
 near March Air Reserve Base in 2019:

Why didn’t the missiles aboard the Flying Falcon explode on impact?

The reason, the Air Force said this week, is that the ordnance attached to the F-16 during its intercept training mission were never armed.

“Aircraft flying this mission do fly with live ordnance. In order for the weapons to detonate, there are multiple conditions that must be met, including arming and launching of the weapon to complete the detonation sequences,” said Capt. Tisha J. Yates, an Air Force spokeswoman at Joint Base Langley-Eustis in Virginia.

The missiles were eventually removed from the jet as it sat in a warehouse on Opportunity Way near the Riverside-Moreno Valley border. They were trucked to nearby Ben Clark Training Center, [where they were destroyed in a controlled detonation](https://www.pressenterprise.com/2019/05/17/x-9/)
.

“The determination to move civilians away from the scene was a safety measure put in place by the incident commander on scene and in coordination with NORAD based on the hazards present until all munitions were secured,” Yates said in response to questions from this news organization, [which first reported the cause of the crash](https://www.pressenterprise.com/2020/04/23/hydraulic-failure-caused-f-16-to-crash-near-march-base-last-year-air-force-says/)
.

The F-16 was assigned to the 114th Fighter Wing at Joe Foss Field in South Dakota. The pilot was attached to the 144th Fighter Wing at March.

On May 16, 2019, the pilot was returning from the two-jet maneuvers about 120 miles east of March when he lost hydraulic pressure and therefore the ability to control the aircraft. At 3:39 p.m., after burning off fuel, he ejected about 250 feet off the ground less than a mile from the base. The pilot suffered minor injuries, as did about a dozen people in the warehouse where the plane crashed.

The Air Force concluded in its 22-page accident report that the $24 million jet lost the fluid from its two hydraulic tanks when two inlet check valves — each less than an inch tall — failed because they were improperly installed.

Each valve consists of a cap, screw threads, a retainer ring and an O-ring that collectively are referred to as a screw cap. That screw cap screws into the valve body. The retainer helps keep the O-ring in place. It is primarily the screw cap retainer and O-ring that prevent hydraulic fluid from leaking under high pressure.

The investigation determined that both screw caps were not properly screwed into the valve bodies. The retainers were found to be deformed, and portions of the O-rings were missing. As a result, hydraulic fluid leaked out through the threads between the screw caps and the valve bodies.

A suspected hydraulic leak had been noted in the jet in March 2019. A new flight-control system that had been overhauled months earlier was installed on March 28, and the plane flew 10 more missions without incident before the crash. The report concluded that the overhaul process lacked “an effective procedure to identify improper installation of ISA check valves.” ISA stands for Integrated Servo Actuator, a flight-control system.

In the wake of the crash, the Air Force also said this week that it studied the overhaul process and found a problem with how the inlet check valve was assembled during overhauls, said Derek Kaufman, a civilian spokesman for the Air Force Materiel Command at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio.

There are two approved configurations of the valves. The older configuration uses smaller Teflon backing rings, and newer configurations use larger rings. The team discovered the potential for installation of the wrong-size backing ring since both size rings were packaged side by side, Kaufman said.

As a result, the Air Force changed the process for assembling the valves during overhauls. It separated the installation and inspection steps on the work documentation and added a secondary quality check for just O-ring backing ring installation. And it inserted a “quality stamp” of the entire process for the first six months after the changes to ensure proper training was accomplished.

The Air Force also inspected all of its inlet check valves and found three to be defective. Those were fixed, Kaufman said.

“We review the facts for any lessons that can be applied to maintenance processes and training to improve the safety and quality of systems we deliver to our warfighters,” he said.

The improper installation of two parts caused an [F-16](/weapons/f-16/ "Learn more about the F-16 Fighting Falcon")
‘s hydraulic system to fail, making the pilot [lose control and crash into a warehouse in May 2019](https://www.airforcemag.com/f-16-crashes-during-norad-training-in-california/)
 while flying back to March Air Reserve Base, Calif., Air Force investigators found.

The F-16 pilot successfully ejected before the Viper crashed into the civilian building. The aircraft was destroyed at a loss of $24.99 million, and caused about $3.9 million in damage to the warehouse, according to an Air Combat Command Accident Investigation Board report.

The F-16C, tail number 88-0477 from the South Dakota Air National Guard’s 114th Fighter Wing, was operated by a pilot from the California Air National Guard’s 144th Fighter Wing Detachment 1 at March for homeland defense missions. On May 16, 2019, the F-16C took off as part of a two-ship formation for an aerospace control alert training mission in a nearby military operating area.

The two F-16s flew one-versus-one tactical intercepts, low-level proficiency training, and local area familiarization. While flying near Palm Springs, the pilot began receiving cockpit warnings of a potential hydraulic system issue with gauges showing low pressure and began going through appropriate checklists, according to the report.

About 20 miles from base, the pilot deployed speed brakes and lowered the landing gear to burn more fuel and let the wingman visually inspect the aircraft. With the speed brakes and gear deployed and locked, the pilot did not yet declare an emergency, but continued the approach to March, the report states.

The aircraft then indicated further loss of pressure in both of its “A and B” systems, and the pilot consulted checklists for dual hydraulic failure. Once they got close to the base, the wingman landed first on one of the base’s runways, allowing the damaged F-16 to land on a runway with an arresting cable.

With both hydraulic systems failing, the pilot declared an emergency and turned on emergency power as a precaution before starting a straight-in approach to the runway. About one mile before touching down, at about 300 feet above ground level, the F-16 began to roll to the left without any pilot input. The pilot tried to maintain control, and counter the roll, but the aircraft rolled hard to the right in a way that was inconsistent with the pilot’s input.

After losing control of the aircraft, the pilot ejected. Immediately after punching out, the F-16 crashed into the warehouse, located across a major highway from the base. A photograph of the impact shows the F-16’s nose sheared off and wings largely removed in a pile of boxes and equipment. The pilot parachuted onto the runway overrun at the base, and was briefly hospitalized with minor injuries.

The Accident Investigation Board found that the cause of the mishap was two improperly installed hydraulic check valves in the aircraft’s right flaperon integrated survoactuator—a part that translates electrical commands to the movement of flight control surfaces. For both of the parts that failed, investigators found the same problem: the retainer on a screw cap had deformed, with fragments tearing away allowing fluid to leak.

“This condition allowed hydraulic fluid to leak from both systems resulting in decreased hydraulic pressure to move flight control surfaces,” the report said. “The \[pilot\] set up to land as soon as possible, but the system had lost enough pressure on final approach to prevent the \[aircraft\] from sustaining controlled flight.”

Maintainers with the 144th Fighter Wing Detachment 1 installed the parts as part of unscheduled maintenance in March 2019 after a possible hydraulic leak was discovered. The parts went through operational checks with no discrepancies found, and the aircraft had flown 10 sorties for 16.3 hours before the crash. The AIB states that there was an inadequate overhaul process, which lacked an effective procedure to identify problems with the installation of the check valves.

A loss of hydraulic pressure prevented the pilot of the Air National Guard’s F-16 [that crashed near March Air Reserve Base](https://www.pe.com/2019/05/16/plane-crashes-near-march-air-reserve-base-215-freeway-shut-down/)
 last year from controlling the jet, the U.S. Air Force says in a report.

The pilot ejected and parachuted onto a base runway on May 16, 2019, suffering minor injuries. The $24 million Fighting Falcon plummeted through the roof of a warehouse, destroying the jet and causing a small fire.

Twelve people in the warehouse were treated for exposure to the debris, the Cal Fire/Riverside County Fire Department said at the time.

The 22-page report, dated April 14, said two inlet-check valves were improperly installed, resulting in damage to them that caused hydraulic fuel to leak.

The valves were part of a flight-control system that was overhauled in January 2019 and installed in the jet after a possible hydraulic leak was discovered several months later.

“The evidence also indicated an inadequate overhaul process that lacked an effective procedure to identify improper installation of ISA check valves,” the report says.

The F-16 was one of two jets initially practicing 120 miles east of March, which sits on the Riverside-Moreno Valley border. The planes were returning to March when the one jet lost hydraulic pressure.

The pilot burned off fuel before ejecting, the report says.

The F-16 was assigned to the 114th Fighter Wing at Joe Foss Field in South Dakota and ran some missions for the 144th Fighter Wing at March.
