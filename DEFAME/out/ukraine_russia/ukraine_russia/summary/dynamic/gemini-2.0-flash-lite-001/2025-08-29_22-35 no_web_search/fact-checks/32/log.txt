1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris once said, 'Ukraine is a country in Europe. It exists next to another country called Russia. Russia is a bigger country. Russia is a powerful country. Russia decided to invade a smaller country called Ukraine. So basically that's wrong.'"

## Actions

```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
NBC News published an article about Kamala Harris warning Russia about sanctions if it invades Ukraine (<image:6298>). NPR published an article that includes an image of Kamala Harris (<image:6299>). Al Jazeera also contains an image of Kamala Harris (<image:6300>).

The articles can be found here: [Source](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/harris-warns-russia-unprecedented-sanctions-if-it-invades-ukraine-n1289387), [Source](https://www.npr.org/2023/02/18/1158129496/kamala-harris-russia-ukraine-crimes-against-humanity), and [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/18/us-russia-committing-crimes-against-humanity-in-ukraine).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Kamala Harris has spoken about Ukraine and Russia. However, the provided evidence does not contain the exact quote attributed to her in the claim.

To verify the claim, I would need to find a transcript or recording of a speech by Kamala Harris where she made the specific statements mentioned.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/feb/17/kamala-harris-trump-russia-congress-ukraine-israel-palestinians): 
Content: The Guardian published an article about Kamala Harris and includes an image of her. <image:6316>

The claim 'U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris once said, 'Ukraine is a country in Europe. It exists next to another country called Russia. Russia is a bigger country. Russia is a powerful country. Russia decided to invade a smaller country called Ukraine. So basically that's wrong.'' is false.
Justification: The claim cannot be verified. While Kamala Harris has spoken about Ukraine and Russia, the provided evidence, including articles from NBC News, NPR, Al Jazeera, Politico, The New York Times, CNN, and The Guardian, does not contain the specific quote attributed to her in the claim.

So, the overall veracity is: false
