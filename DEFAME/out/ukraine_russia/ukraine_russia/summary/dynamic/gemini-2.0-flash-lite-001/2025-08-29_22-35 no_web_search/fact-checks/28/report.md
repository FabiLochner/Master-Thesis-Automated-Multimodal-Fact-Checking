## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The New York Times ([https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/us/politics/lech-walesa-trump-letter.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/us/politics/lech-walesa-trump-letter.html)) published an article about a letter written by Lech Wałęsa to Donald Trump on March 3, 2025. Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/polish-cold-war-hero-walesa-writes-trump-expressing-horror-zelenskiy-spat-2025-03-03/](https://www.reuters.com/world/polish-cold-war-hero-walesa-writes-trump-expressing-horror-zelenskiy-spat-2025-03-03/)) reported that Wałęsa expressed his "horror" at a spat between Trump and Zelenskyy.

The Los Angeles Times ([https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-03-03/polish-democracy-hero-walesa-says-trump-treatment-of-zelensky-filled-him-with-horror](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-03-03/polish-democracy-hero-walesa-says-trump-treatment-of-zelensky-filled-him-with-horror)) also published an article on March 3, 2025, stating that Wałęsa criticized Trump's treatment of Zelensky. ![image 6273](media/2025-08-29_22-41-1756507295-753306.jpg), ![image 6274](media/2025-08-29_22-41-1756507296-318558.jpg), ![image 6275](media/2025-08-29_22-41-1756507296-646401.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Lech Wałęsa wrote a letter to Donald Trump on March 3, 2025. The letter expressed Wałęsa's criticism of Trump's treatment of Zelenskyy. However, the provided sources do not explicitly mention the suspension of U.S. military aid to Ukraine as the primary focus of Wałęsa's criticism.

Therefore, while the claim is partially supported by the evidence, it is not entirely accurate. The evidence suggests that Wałęsa criticized Trump's actions related to Ukraine, but the specific reason for the criticism is not the suspension of military aid.

To fully verify the claim, information is missing regarding the exact content of Wałęsa's letter and whether it specifically addressed the suspension of U.S. military aid.

The claim is not fully supported by the evidence. While Lech Wałęsa did write a letter to Donald Trump in March 2025, criticizing his actions related to Ukraine, the provided sources, such as the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/us/politics/lech-walesa-trump-letter.html), [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/polish-cold-war-hero-walesa-writes-trump-expressing-horror-zelenskiy-spat-2025-03-03/), and the [Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-03-03/polish-democracy-hero-walesa-says-trump-treatment-of-zelensky-filled-him-with-horror), do not explicitly state that the letter criticized the suspension of U.S. military aid to Ukraine.
