## Actions
```
reverse_search(![image 19](media/60.jpg))
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image was found on a website with the title "Dollar Bill Frame Gold Glass Frame For Coin Display Wall Hanging ..." ([https://collegeofems.com/Coin-Display-Wall-Hanging-Coin-Collecting-Holders-Dollar-Bill/983708](https://collegeofems.com/Coin-Display-Wall-Hanging-Coin-Collecting-Holders-Dollar-Bill/983708)). The image was also found on Etsy, which shows a listing for custom dollar bill art ([https://www.etsy.com/ie/listing/1407539034/custom-dollar-dollar-bill-art-100-dollar](https://www.etsy.com/ie/listing/1407539034/custom-dollar-dollar-bill-art-100-dollar)). The image was also found on Redbubble, a website that sells stickers. ![image 19](media/60.jpg)

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the image in the claim has been used on websites selling art and stickers. This suggests that the image is not an authentic X post from Elon Musk. The image appears to be a manipulated dollar bill featuring Donald Trump.

The reverse image search results do not provide any information to support the claim that the image is an authentic X post.


## Final Judgement
The evidence suggests that the image is not an authentic X post from Elon Musk. The image has been found on websites selling art and stickers, indicating it is a manipulated image.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image in the claim is not an authentic X post from Elon Musk. Reverse image searches revealed the image is used on websites selling art and stickers, indicating it is a manipulated image, and not an actual post from Elon Musk.
