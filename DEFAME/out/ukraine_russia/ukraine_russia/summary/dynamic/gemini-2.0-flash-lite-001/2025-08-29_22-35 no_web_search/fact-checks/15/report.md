A Pew Research Center survey from July 2024 shows mixed views of Zelenskyy globally, but does not include data from February 2025.

Euronews.com published an article on February 19, 2025, stating that Zelenskyy's approval rating grew to 57%.

## Elaboration
The claim is false. According to a Euronews.com article published on February 19, 2025, Zelenskyy's approval rating was 57% at that time.

## Final Judgement
The Euronews.com article from February 19, 2025, states that Zelenskyy's approval rating was 57%, directly contradicting the claim of a 4% approval rating. The Pew Research Center survey from July 2024 does not provide data for February 2025.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. A Euronews.com article from February 19, 2025, reported Zelenskyy's approval rating at 57%, directly contradicting the 4% figure stated in the claim.
