The claim 'In March 2025 former President of Poland Lech Wałęsa wrote a letter to Donald Trump criticizing the U.S. President's decision to suspend the delivery of all U.S. military aid to Ukraine.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not fully supported by the evidence. While Lech Wałęsa did write a letter to Donald Trump in March 2025, criticizing his actions related to Ukraine, the provided sources, such as the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/us/politics/lech-walesa-trump-letter.html), [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/polish-cold-war-hero-walesa-writes-trump-expressing-horror-zelenskiy-spat-2025-03-03/), and the [Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-03-03/polish-democracy-hero-walesa-says-trump-treatment-of-zelensky-filled-him-with-horror), do not explicitly state that the letter criticized the suspension of U.S. military aid to Ukraine.

So, the overall veracity is: false
