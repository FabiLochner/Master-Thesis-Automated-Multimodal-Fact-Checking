## Elaboration
The evidence includes an article from April 13, 2022, stating that the U.S. announced an additional $800 million in military aid to Ukraine. This information is insufficient to verify the claim.

The claim states that as of February 2025, the United States had given $350 billion in military aid to Ukraine. The provided evidence does not mention the total amount of military aid.

To verify the claim, I would need to find the total amount of military aid provided by the U.S. to Ukraine up to February 2025.


## Final Judgement
The search results provide information about U.S. military aid to Ukraine, including announcements and discussions about aid, but they do not specify the total amount of aid provided as of February 2025. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available evidence. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The provided evidence does not contain the specific amount of military aid the United States provided to Ukraine as of February 2025. While the search results mention U.S. aid and related discussions, they lack the necessary data to confirm the claim of $350 billion. Therefore, the claim is unverified.
