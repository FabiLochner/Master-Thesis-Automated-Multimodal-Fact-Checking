Useful result: From [Source](https://www.ft.com/content/71ef1c81-6b72-4b48-a25d-71d029327f23): 
Content: The Financial Times published an article with an image of Volodymyr Zelenskyy. <image:6312>

The claim 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy owns 15 homes including a $35 million home in Florida, has $1.2 billion in an overseas bank account, owns 15 homes, three private planes and has a monthly income of $11 million.' is false.
Justification: The claim is unsubstantiated. While images show Zelenskyy near planes and a Florida mansion, there is no evidence to confirm the specific details of his assets, such as the number of homes, the amount in his bank account, or his monthly income. The search results point to articles about his income declaration and offshore connections, but the content is not provided to verify the claim.

So, the overall veracity is: false
