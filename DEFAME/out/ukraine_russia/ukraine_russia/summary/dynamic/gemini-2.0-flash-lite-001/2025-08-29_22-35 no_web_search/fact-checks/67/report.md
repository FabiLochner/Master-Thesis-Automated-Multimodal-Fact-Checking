## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
CNN published an article about the Los Angeles wildfires in January 2025, as seen on [cnn.com](https://www.cnn.com/weather/live-news/los-angeles-wildfires-palisades-eaton-california-01-10-25-hnk) ![image 6577](media/2025-08-29_22-52-1756507968-537460.jpg).

## Elaboration
The new evidence reveals that a Russian occupation head in Kherson offered shelter to California wildfire victims, as reported by united24media.com. However, this does not directly confirm that Russia offered assistance for the California wildfires.

The claim remains unverified. The evidence suggests a connection between Russia and the wildfires, but it does not explicitly state that Russia offered assistance.


## Final Judgement
The search results confirm the existence of California wildfires in January 2025 and Russia's involvement in the situation, including a Russian official offering shelter to victims. However, there is no direct evidence that Russia offered assistance for the California wildfires.

The claim is not supported by the evidence, as the search results do not provide any information about Russia offering assistance for the California wildfires. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The fact-check reveals that while there were California wildfires in January 2025, and Russia was involved in exploiting the situation, there is no evidence to support the claim that Russia offered assistance for the wildfires. The search results show a Russian official offering shelter to victims, but not direct assistance for the fires. Therefore, the claim is unverified.
