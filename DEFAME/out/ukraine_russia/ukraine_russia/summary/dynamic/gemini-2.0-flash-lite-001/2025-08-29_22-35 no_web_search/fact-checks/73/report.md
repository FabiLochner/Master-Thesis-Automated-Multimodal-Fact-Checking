## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (![image 22](media/73.jpg)) shows the wreckage of an F-16 that crashed into a warehouse near March Air Reserve Base, Calif., in May 2019. The crash was caused by improperly installed parts in the aircraft's hydraulic system. The pilot ejected and survived.

The Press-Enterprise published an article on May 1, 2020, about the crash, stating that the missiles on board did not explode because they were not armed.

## Elaboration
The image depicts the wreckage of an F-16 fighter jet that crashed near March Air Reserve Base in California in May 2019. The crash was caused by improperly installed parts in the aircraft's hydraulic system. The pilot ejected and survived. The claim that the image shows a Ukrainian F-16 shot down by Russia is false.


## Final Judgement
The image shows the wreckage of an F-16 fighter jet that crashed near March Air Reserve Base in California in May 2019 due to mechanical failure, not a Russian attack in Ukraine. The claim misrepresents the origin and context of the image.

`false`
