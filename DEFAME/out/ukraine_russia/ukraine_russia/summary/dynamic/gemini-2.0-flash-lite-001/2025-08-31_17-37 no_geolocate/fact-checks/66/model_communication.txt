### TEHRAN (Tasnim) - Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova commented on reports that hundreds of prisoners have been mobilized to extinguish fires in the US state of California, pointing to the hypocrisy of the US.

[\- Other Media news -](/en/service/1200/other-media)

Earlier, The Washington Post, citing the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, reported that the state authorities had sent 395 prisoners to fight forest fires. The diplomat noted that in 2023, Washington restricted imports of products from several Chinese companies in an attempt to exclude goods allegedly produced with the help of Uygur forced labor from the US supply chain.

"This raises a logical question: will Congress draft a bill imposing sanctions on California authorities, private companies, and ordinary Americans for using prison labor to put out fires?" she wondered. "We are so sick of this hypocrisy!" Zakharova added.

Wildfires began to spread across Los Angeles County on January 7."

Did Russia offer sanctuary to California residents who lost their homes in the Los Angeles fires? A viral X [post](https://x.com/jacksonhinklle/status/1879042008465183185)
 by Jackson Hinkle—a [regular purveyor](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/11/business/media/jackson-hinkle-israel-gaza-misinformation.html)
 of Russia-related misinformation—claims so.

“BREAKING: RUSSIA has offered shelter & sanctuary to Californians whose livelihoods were DESTROYED in the LA wildfires,” reads the post, which had more than 500,000 views on X as of January 15. 

[Fact Check](https://thedispatch.com/category/fact-check/)

Assessing Claims That Russia Offered Sanctuary to California Fire Victims
=========================================================================

One Russian governor did make an offer, but there are some caveats.

! A single Russian governor said that he would welcome California fire victims to the region of occupied Ukraine he oversees, but only if they don’t support the government in Kyiv.

On Monday, Vladimir Saldo, the governor of the Russian-occupied Kherson oblast region of Ukraine, [told](https://tass.ru/obschestvo/22867057)
 _TASS_—a Russian state-controlled media outlet—that the region would accept any Americans who lost their homes in this month’s California fires. “Despite the ongoing, blatantly anti-Russian policy of the United States, we fully understand that natural disasters don’t care who you are or what you do,” Saldo said, [according to](https://www.rt.com/russia/610836-california-fires-sanctuary-kherson/)
 Russia Today, a Russian state-controlled network that translated the statement into English. Therefore, our region is ready to welcome any American citizen who has lost their home and livelihood.”

That offer comes with a caveat, applying only to Californians who haven’t supported Ukraine since Russia invaded its borders in February 2022. Sutton")

Other Russian Telegram channels are also spreading false or unverified narratives about the southern California fires and the government's response, as well as amplifying critiques from Americans including the president-elect's son, Donald Trump, Jr., Andy Carvin of the Atlantic Council's DFRLab told NPR in an email. The Russian news site [Pravda](https://web.archive.org/web/20250115205032/https://news-pravda.com/world/2025/01/08/963104.html)
, which has been associated with prior Russian information operations, then translates and distributes the Telegram posts.

"Over the last week, Pravda has published at least 350 stories of this type \[based on Telegram messages about the fires\], based on our initial content analysis of the site," Carvin said.

[Print Article](/download/article/23979)

Last week, devastating wildfires ignited across Los Angeles County in what is one of the most destructive natural disasters in US history. But as firefighters continue to battle the flames, false and misleading information about the disaster [has spread](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/10/rightwing-misinformation-los-angeles-fire)
 just as quickly on social media. While much of the false information seemingly originated from users in the United States, Russian state-affiliated accounts also leveraged the California wildfires and narratives reverberating among certain segments of the US public to sow division, undermine trust in relief efforts, and reduce public support for Ukraine.  

**Diverting Resources to Ukraine** 

Amid the destructive wildfires in Los Angeles, Russian government officials and state-affiliated media have propagated narratives critical of the Biden administration and other Democratic leaders to aggravate political division, particularly on Ukraine, and to denigrate the United States. Russian-state controlled outlet Sputnik further [mocked](https://x.com/Sputnik_India/status/1879127371049001320)
 Biden’s emergency relief payments to victims of the wildfires, claiming that they receive less daily per capita than people in Ukraine and Israel.  

Russian state-controlled media outlets further [honed in](https://sputnikglobe.com/20250109/california-wildfires-unexpected-links-to-us-green-lobby-and-ukraine-1121391704.html)
 [on reports](https://x.com/SputnikInt/status/1877282105815597399)
 that the Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) donated surplus equipment to Ukraine in 2022 [to suggest](https://x.com/SputnikInt/status/1877345987468882396)
 that those donations [created a lack of](https://x.com/RT_com/status/1877126472915128820)
 resources to fight fires. Additionally, Russian state media seized on the fires to fuel divides on other partisan policy issues, linking the fires to the “[green lobby](https://sputnikglobe.com/20250109/california-wildfires-unexpected-links-to-us-green-lobby-and-ukraine-1121391704.html)
” and [blaming](https://x.com/RT_com/status/1877151147703562608)
 the firefighter shortage on COVID-19 vaccine mandates.

**Amplifying** **AI-Generated Content**

In at least one case, Russian state media amplified a misleading image generated by artificial intelligence (AI). Other Russian-language media outlets subsequently spread the image. 

**Conclusion** 

Kremlin-affiliated accounts have leveraged the California wildfires to further advance Russia’s geopolitical agenda. In a press conference on January 14, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov [claimed](https://x.com/SputnikInt/status/1879100711361016212)
 the estimated $250 billion worth of damage sustained from the California fires is comparable to the amount Washington “pumped into Ukraine”. Russia’s messaging on the wildfires further underlines a trend of autocratic states [exploiting natural disasters](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/investigations/russia-china-cuba-amplified-falsehoods-recent-hurricanes-us-official-s-rcna177672)
 to advance their geopolitical goals. This approach keeps with Russia’s now [longstanding strategy](https://securingdemocracy.gmfus.org/a-year-of-disinformation-russia-and-chinas-influence-campaigns-during-the-war-in-ukraine/)
 to dent US support for Ukraine by playing to pocketbook issues and perceptions that domestic issues have received less attention than foreign ones.

**Blaming DEI**

Accounts affiliated with Russia echoed narratives prominent among American audiences that claim diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives hindered wildfire recovery efforts. Russian state-controlled media outlet RT [accused](https://x.com/RT_com/status/1876870822637248582)
 LAFD Chief Kristen Crowly—the first woman and openly gay person to serve in the role—of prioritizing DEI initiatives at the expense of preventing fires. Sputnik also [posted](https://x.com/SputnikInt/status/1877278684240859332)
 a local news clip of a California resident who claimed that “gay people” were the cause of the fires."

Tasnim News Agency published an article on January 12, 2025, discussing Russia's comments on the California wildfires, including comments from Maria Zakharova. The article mentions that wildfires began to spread across Los Angeles County on January 7.

The Dispatch published an article on January 15, 2025, discussing claims that Russia offered sanctuary to California fire victims. Vladimir Saldo offered to accept Americans who lost their homes in the California fires, but only those who haven't supported Ukraine since February 2022. ([https://thedispatch.com/article/assessing-claims-that-russia-offered-sanctuary-to-california-fire-victims/](https://thedispatch.com/article/assessing-claims-that-russia-offered-sanctuary-to-california-fire-victims/)) <image:4838>

An NPR article, published on January 16, 2025, discusses how pro-Kremlin social media accounts spread a narrative about the Los Angeles wildfires. The article states that Russian news sites are spreading false or unverified narratives about the California fires. ([https://www.npr.org/2025/01/16/nx-s1-5259842/los-angeles-california-fires-russia-ukraine](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/16/nx-s1-5259842/los-angeles-california-fires-russia-ukraine)) <image:4849>, <image:4853>


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Russia commented on the California wildfires and that Vladimir Saldo offered sanctuary to fire victims. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Russia offered assistance for the California wildfires.

The NPR article suggests that Russian news sites spread false or unverified narratives about the fires. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence.

To verify the claim, information about any specific offers of assistance from Russia would be needed.

**Communities in Los Angeles continue to grapple with the lasting effects of the devastating Palisades and Eaton wildfires, which destroyed more than 16,000 structures and displaced tens of thousands of residents.**

Following emergency distributions of **hygiene supplies, personal protective equipment (PPE), re-entry kits, and other items,** Project HOPE’s Emergency Response Team is now focusing on filling the existing service gap in mental health and resilience programming for children, parents, teachers, and social workers who are processing the trauma and devastation of the wildfires.

### How is Project HOPE responding to the wildfires in Los Angeles?

  
**Project HOPE has reached over 16,000 fire-affected community members since the beginning of our response.** This support includes health consultations (provided through local partners) and distributions of air purifiers, air filters, PPE, re-entry kits, dignity products, clean water, over-the-counter medicines, and Psychological First Aid items for children. 

**Project HOPE has developed a comprehensive mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) program to strengthen the capacity of frontline workers and meet the urgent mental health needs of children.** Beginning with the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District, Project HOPE will be supporting direct engagement with children impacted by the fires, including those displaced and those who have lost their homes.

### **What are the greatest health needs following the wildfires?**  

![firefighter gathering gear to handle fire in the background](/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/0014_USA_CaliforniaFire_RVeliu_01_2025.webp)

The health impacts of wildfires are expected to be severe, especially for marginalized communities and people with pre-existing health conditions. While wildfires differ from hurricanes and the scales of devastation are different, we know that mental health issues are likely to skyrocket following this disaster. 

“I’ve faced crises and emergencies across the country and around the world, but the apocalyptic conditions unfolding here in my own community of Los Angeles are unlike anything I’ve ever experienced,” said Chessa Latifi, Deputy Director of Emergency Preparedness and Response for Project HOPE. Project HOPE is on the ground in Los Angeles providing long-term support following the devastating wildfires.

Senate Republican Leader John Thune (R-SD) and Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) have announced committee assignments for the new Congress, including appointments for newly elected members.

On the Finance Committee, which will take the lead in crafting an extension and modification of the 2017 tax law, Senator Roger Marshall (R-KS) is the only new Republican addition to this key committee. He will be joined by fellow freshmen senators Adam Schiff (D-CA), Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-DE), and Angela Alsobrooks (D-MD).

The Commerce, Science, & Transportation Committee, with responsibility for aviation and surface transportation policy, will include Senators Bernie Moreno (R-OH), Tim Sheehy (R-MT), and Curtis. There was significant turnover on the Democratic side, with senators Sanders (I-VT), Smith (D-MN), Lujan (D-NM), Warnock (D-GA), and Welch (D-VT) replacing departing members.

Newly elected John Curtis (R-UT) will be joining the Environment & Public Works Committee, which has jurisdiction over federal highway, water, and environmental infrastructure programs. On the Democratic side, the committee adds newly elected senators Andy Kim (D-NJ) and Blunt Rochester.

Senators Jim Justice (R-WV) and Dave McCormack (R-PA) will join the Energy Committee on the majority side, along with Senator Ruben Gallego (D-AZ) on the minority.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence does not support the claim that John Thune blocked Adam Schiff's committee assignments because of his past work in the Russia investigation. The search results mention committee assignments for both senators but do not indicate any blocking. One article mentions Schiff's role in the Russia investigation, but it does not link this to any action by Thune regarding committee assignments.

The provided evidence is insufficient to verify the claim. More information is needed to confirm whether Thune took any action to block Schiff's committee assignments and the reasons behind such actions.

Content: "Adam Schiff and some of the other Democrats Pelosi picked on the panel will wear out the carpet between the committee room and the TV live-shot locations during the hearings, but now Republicans won’t have their wrecking crew there to discredit the proceedings. John Thune, part of the Republican leadership team that helped defeat the measure, said that an independent commission would be a distraction from the GOP’s “midterm message.” “Anything that gets us rehashing the 2020 elections,” Thune told CNN, “is a day lost on being able to draw a contrast between us and the Democrats’ very radical left-wing agenda.” Plus, Thune fretted, the commission’s findings could be “weaponized politically and drug into next year.” Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski, one of just six Republicans to support the creation of the commission, seemed to agree with Thune’s premise as she lamented “a decision for the short-term political gain.”

But what if there is no gain?

Senate Republicans managed to kill an independent commission of experts chosen on a bipartisan basis that was required to finish its work by the end of the year. It looks quite the opposite today.

Members like Thune and Blunt knew that if they defeated the commission, Pelosi would make good on her threat to empanel a special select committee to take up the probe. The pressure is on McCarthy now to punish Cheney and Kinzinger with some kind of official opprobrium, like stripping them of their committee assignments, for accepting Pelosi’s appointments. In its place, they will now have a committee of politicians selected entirely by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The committee will have no deadline, but will still retain at least a veneer of bipartisanship thanks to Pelosi’s inclusion of two Republican members, Reps. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois. Even better for Democrats, the committee itself is a powerful tool to divide and distract Republicans. But the select committee’s work, which will begin on Tuesday, will have significant consequences for Senate Republicans’ hopes of regaining the majority next year.

Let’s stipulate here that most of the Senate Republicans who voted against the commission either genuinely oppose additional inquest into the attack or are too scared of a primary challenge to say otherwise. But they also would have expected that the committee would quickly devolve into partisan farce, much as much of the committee work in the House does these days."

**Thune Previews Plans for 2025 Reconciliation Bills** – Incoming Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) stated in a closed-door meeting with Senate Republicans last week that he will seek to pass a budget reconciliation bill within the first 30-days of the new Trump administration that focuses on border security, defense, and energy. While Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) has already been selected by Republicans as their nominee, he will need to be elected speaker by a majority of the chamber come January.

Incoming Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) has also posted the Senate’s [calendar](https://x.com/SenJohnThune/status/1864741224663425087) for 2025. John Duarte’s (R-Calif.) loss to former state assemblyman Adam Gray (D). Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) and Andy Kim (D-N.J.) resigned from the House of Representatives and will be sworn in on Monday as members of the U.S. Thune then plans to work to pass a second reconciliation bill later in the year to deal with extending the 2017 tax cuts that are set to expire at the end of 2025. Thune’s agenda is at odds with the goals of some Republicans in the House of Representatives, who are aiming to pass a tax bill within President Donald Trump’s first 100 days in office.

**Lawmakers Continue Negotiations on Year-End Package, Health Extenders** – Members of Congress continue to negotiate a year-end funding package that could include health care related extenders. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) will serve as chair of the Democratic Steering and Policy Committee, replacing retiring Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) will chair the Democratic Strategic Communications Committee. Suzan DelBene (D-Wash.) to continue to serve as chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The article from ACEC.org discusses the Senate committee assignments for the 119th Congress, mentioning that Senator Adam Schiff (D-CA) was assigned to the Finance Committee and that Senate Republican Leader John Thune (R-SD) and Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) announced the committee assignments. [<image:2574>] and [<image:1>] The document from torreydc.com lists the Senate Committee Assignments for the 119th Congress, with Adam Schiff (D-CA) assigned to several committees and John Thune (R-SD) assigned to others. The document does not mention any blocking of committee assignments. The document from hklaw.com lists the committee assignments for the House of Representatives and the Senate for the 118th Congress. Adam Schiff is listed as a member of the House Committee on the Judiciary, and John Thune is listed as a member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.

### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-ap-top-news-ca-state-wire-adam-schiff-politics-3eec3ea9be5c07a9c297bad439f8f3e8): 
Content: The Associated Press published an article about Adam Schiff, mentioning his role as the lead impeachment prosecutor against Donald Trump. <image:i> The article states that Schiff has been a frequent target of conservatives since the then GOP-led House Intelligence Committee started investigating Trump’s ties to Russia in the 2016 election.


## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim that John Thune blocked Adam Schiff's committee assignments because of his past work in the Russia investigation. The search results mention committee assignments for both senators but do not indicate any blocking. One article mentions Schiff's role in the Russia investigation, but it does not link this to any action by Thune regarding committee assignments.

The provided evidence is insufficient to verify the claim. More information is needed to confirm whether Thune took any action to block Schiff's committee assignments and the reasons behind such actions.

| Member of the [U.S. The fact that we have questions about this is in itself harmful".[\[84\]](#cite_note-84)
 The next morning on Twitter, Trump called Schiff "Sleazy Adam Schiff, the totally biased Congressman looking into 'Russia'" and called the Russian collusion investigation "the Dem loss excuse".[\[85\]](#cite_note-85)
 Schiff responded on Twitter that the president's "comments and actions are beneath the dignity of the office".[\[86\]](#cite_note-86)

In December 2018, Schiff suggested that Trump associate [Roger Stone](/wiki/Roger_Stone "Roger Stone")
 might have lied to Congress, and said the transcript of his testimony should be forwarded to the Special Counsel.[\[87\]](#cite_note-87)
 In November 2019, Stone was convicted of lying to Congress.[\[88\]](#cite_note-88)

When he became chair of the House Intelligence Committee in 2019, Schiff embarked on a personal mission to investigate Trump's connections to Russia, separate from the Special Counsel investigation.[\[89\]](#cite_note-89)
 He came under fire when he demurred when asked if he would accept it if the Special Counsel's investigation concluded that Trump had not colluded with Russia, saying that he had great confidence in Mueller but that "there may be, for example, evidence of collusion or conspiracy that is clear and convincing, but not proof beyond a reasonable doubt", as is needed for a criminal conviction.[\[90\]](#cite_note-90)

On March 28, 2019, the nine Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee officially called for Schiff to resign due to his allegations that Trump's campaign colluded with Russians in the 2016 election.[\[91\]](#cite_note-91)
 Schiff responded by accusing the Republican members of tolerating "immoral" and "corrupt" conduct by Trump campaign members and administration appointees.[\[92\]](#cite_note-92)
[\[93\]](#cite_note-93)

, which included testimony from three Republican officials to whom Trump reached out after the election: Georgia secretary of state [Brad Raffensperger](/wiki/Brad_Raffensperger "Brad Raffensperger")
, his deputy Gabe Sterling, and Arizona House of Representatives speaker [Rusty Bowers](/wiki/Rusty_Bowers "Rusty Bowers")
.[\[123\]](#cite_note-123)
 The second half of the hearing focused on Trump supporters' harassment of and threats to Georgia poll worker [Wandrea' ArShaye Moss](/wiki/Wandrea%27_ArShaye_Moss "Wandrea' ArShaye Moss")
 and her family, which led her to quit her job and go into hiding.[\[124\]](#cite_note-124)

Schiff was interviewed after the hearing by reporters and called the testimony "enormously powerful".[\[125\]](#cite_note-125)
 He added, "The lie lives on, and with it so does the danger."

### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-ap-top-news-ca-state-wire-adam-schiff-politics-3eec3ea9be5c07a9c297bad439f8f3e8): 
Content: The Associated Press published an article about Adam Schiff, mentioning his role as the lead impeachment prosecutor against Donald Trump. <image:i> The article states that Schiff has been a frequent target of conservatives since the then GOP-led House Intelligence Committee started investigating Trump’s ties to Russia in the 2016 election.


## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim that John Thune blocked Adam Schiff's committee assignments because of his past work in the Russia investigation. The search results mention committee assignments for both senators but do not indicate any blocking. One article mentions Schiff's role in the Russia investigation, but it does not link this to any action by Thune regarding committee assignments.

The provided evidence is insufficient to verify the claim. More information is needed to confirm whether Thune took any action to block Schiff's committee assignments and the reasons behind such actions.

Thune follows in the footsteps of the longest-serving Senate GOP leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, and takes the reins as Republicans prepare to control the Senate, House and White House once President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan.

Still, Thune hammered in his opening remarks at the start of the 119th Congress that the Senate must remain the “more stable, more thoughtful, more deliberative” body.

“Unfortunately, today there are a lot of people who would like to see the Senate turn into a copy of the House of Representatives,” Thune said on the floor.

“And that,” he continued, “is not what our founders intended or what our country needs. Adam Schiff of California and New Jersey’s Andy Kim took their oaths in December.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that Adam Schiff was removed from the House Intelligence Committee by Kevin McCarthy. However, the evidence does not support the claim that John Thune blocked Adam Schiff's committee assignments. The search results show that Thune is the Senate Majority Leader and that Schiff was assigned to committees. The evidence does not provide any statement from Thune regarding Schiff's committee assignments. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.

Biden approves nuclear strategy refocusing on China threat – report
===================================================================

This article is more than 1 year old

White House says plan was approved earlier this year and was not a response to a single country or threat

[Joe Biden](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden)
 has approved a US nuclear strategy to prepare for possible coordinated nuclear confrontations with Russia, China and North Korea, according to a New York Times [report](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/us/politics/biden-nuclear-china-russia.html)
 on Tuesday.

On Tuesday, the White House said the president approved the plan earlier this year and it was not a response to a single country or threat.

The spokesperson Sean Savett said that while “the specific text of the guidance is classified, its existence is in no way secret. “It is possible that we will one day look back and see the quarter-century after the cold war as nuclear intermission.”

On Tuesday, the Times reported that two senior administration officials had earlier been permitted to allude to the revision in US nuclear strategy without disclosing its existence.

In June, Pranay Vaddi, a senior director of the national security council, [warned](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/17/row-as-nato-chief-hints-at-talks-to-increase-availability-of-nuclear-weapons)
 that “absent a change” in nuclear strategy by China and Russia, the US was prepared to shift from modernisation of existing weapons to expanding its arsenal.

Vaddi also alluded to the highly classified document, saying it emphasised “the need to deter Russia, the PRC \[People’s Republic of China\] and [North Korea](https://www.theguardian.com/world/north-korea)
 simultaneously”.

The last major nuclear arms control agreement with Russia, [New Start](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/31/us-russia-new-start-nuclear-arms-treaty)

China’s president, Xi Jinping, and his US counterpart, Joe Biden, meeting at the G20 summit in Bali, Indonesia, in November 2022. The Russian president, [Vladimir Putin](https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin)
, has [threatened](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/21/russia-begins-tactical-nuclear-weapon-drills-near-ukraine-border)
 to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine.

China’s foreign ministry on Wednesday said that it was “seriously concerned” by the reports and accused the US of “stirring up the so-called ‘China nuclear threat theory’”. But China’s arsenal is thought to be expanding at a much faster pace than any other country’s.

The US-based Arms Control Association said it understood US nuclear weapons strategy and posture remained the same as described in the administration’s 2022 nuclear posture review, and there had been no reorientation away from [Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia)
 and toward China.

Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association, said that while US intelligence estimates suggested China might increase the size of its nuclear arsenal from 500 to 1,000 warheads by 2030, Russia currently had about 4,000 nuclear warheads “and it remains the major driver behind US nuclear strategy”.

Biden approved the revised strategy – called the nuclear employment guidance – in March, according to the Times, but an unclassified notification of the policy change has not yet been presented to Congress.

After years of nuclear arms reduction efforts, the administration has been signalling willingness to expand the US arsenal to counter China and Russia’s nuclear strategies more recently. Last month, Chinese and Russian long-range bombers patrolled together near Alaska for the first time and held live-fire exercises in the South China Sea.

The second US administration official permitted to refer to the document, Vipin Narang, an MIT nuclear strategist who served in the Pentagon, said earlier this month that Biden had “issued updated nuclear weapons employment guidance to account for multiple nuclear-armed adversaries” and for “the significant increase in the size and diversity” of China’s nuclear arsenal.

“It is our responsibility to see the world as it is, not as we hoped or wished it would be,” the Times quoted Narang as saying. The guidance issued earlier this year is not a response to any single entity, country, nor threat.”

The Times reported that the deterrent policy takes into account a rapid buildup of [China’s nuclear arsenal](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/20/china-expanding-nuclear-arsenal-much-faster-than-predicted-us-report-says)
, which will rival the size and diversity of the US and Russian stockpiles over the next decade. In February, the US [warned](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/feb/14/mike-turner-national-security-threat)
 allies that Russia could be planning to put a nuclear weapon into space.

On Tuesday, a retired senior colonel in the Chinese People’s Liberation Army, Zhou Bo, [published a piece](https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/08/20/nuclear-weapons-war-no-first-use-policy/)
 in Foreign Policy arguing that the US and China could still cooperate on nuclear diplomacy."

Biden’s most important nuclear achievement has been successfully deterring Russian nuclear escalation over the war in Ukraine: Russia has not used nuclear weapons against NATO members or against Ukraine itself. Indeed, the treaty is still standing only because Biden quickly negotiated an [extension](https://www.state.gov/on-the-extension-of-the-new-start-treaty-with-the-russian-federation/)
 during his first weeks in office, and the administration has expressed [continued](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2022-12/news/bidens-nuclear-posture-straddles-obama-trump-policies)
 interest in strategic arms control if it can find a willing partner in Moscow.

The Biden administration has also worked to stabilize relations with China, a country whose nuclear arsenal is undergoing a rapid [expansion](https://media.defense.gov/2023/Oct/19/2003323409/-1/-1/1/2023-MILITARY-AND-SECURITY-DEVELOPMENTS-INVOLVING-THE-PEOPLES-REPUBLIC-OF-CHINA.PDF)
. These differences matter because of the enormous presidential latitude with respect to nuclear decision-making, including presidents’ [sole authority](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/natsec/IF10521.pdf)
 to launch nuclear weapons without authorization from other parts of the government.

While in office, Trump was often confrontational in his dealings with other nuclear powers and was openly skeptical of the alliance relationships that depend on U.S. While valuing a robust deterrent, Biden also has a long-standing commitment to arms control.

What Trump did on nuclear policy while in office
------------------------------------------------

Trump’s [decision](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j-trump-ending-united-states-participation-unacceptable-iran-deal/)
 to renege on the Iran nuclear deal—despite the [State Department](https://2017-2021.state.gov/briefings/department-press-briefing-july-18-2017/)
 certifying that Iran was complying with its terms—was likely the most significant nuclear policy decision of his time in office. In fact, North Korea significantly expanded and improved its nuclear arsenal on Trump’s watch, gaining the [ability](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/north-korea-fires-ballistic-missile-south-korea-says-2023-12-17/)
 to hit the continental United States with a nuclear-tipped ballistic missile.

Furthermore, Trump actively stoked a dangerous nuclear crisis with North Korea in the period leading up to the summit. At another point, he [tweeted](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/948355557022420992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E948355557022420992%7Ctwgr%5E8f3c7c895f959526a3e4adcaae7b41e23ea14eba%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2018%2F01%2F02%2Fpolitics%2Fdonald-trump-north-korea-nuclear%2Findex.html)
 of Kim, “Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!” Trump was later [revealed](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-discussed-using-nuclear-weapon-north-korea-2017-blaming-someone-rcna65120)
 to have privately considered using a nuclear weapon against North Korea while falsely blaming it on another country.

Finally, the Trump administration was highly skeptical of arms control with other nuclear powers. China’s nuclear arsenal is expanding as it becomes increasingly [confrontational](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/china-starts-military-drills-around-taiwan-days-after-new-president-takes-office-2024-05-23/#:~:text=China%20launched%20military%20drills%20around,of%20high%2Dvalue%20military%20targets.)
 toward Taiwan. This is in significant part because Biden has effectively [communicated](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/31/opinion/biden-ukraine-strategy.html)
 that the United States will defend NATO, and also that it would respond forcefully (though almost certainly [not](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/will-biden-putin-goes-nuclear-experts-say-nuclear-response-unlikely-no-rcna32756)
 with nuclear weapons) to Russian nuclear use in Ukraine. For example, it has ([mostly](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/24/us-long-range-missiles-ukraine-00154110)
) constrained Ukraine’s ability to conduct longer-range attacks on Russian territory with U.S.-supplied weapons.

Furthermore, the Biden administration has taken steps to stabilize the overall strategic nuclear relationship with Russia. It has also fortified the defense relationship with South Korea through the [Washington Declaration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/04/26/washington-declaration-2/)
, which will engage the two countries more closely on nuclear deterrence matters.

What Biden might do on nuclear policy if reelected
--------------------------------------------------

As with Trump, Biden’s first term in office provides useful guidance as to his likely nuclear policy priorities were he to be reelected."

[###### Morning Briefing: Aug. Only a limited number of hard copies have been distributed to select national security officials and Pentagon leaders, the newspaper reported.

The newspaper added, however, that in recent speeches, two senior administration officials were allowed to allude to the change prior to a more comprehensive and unclassified update to Congress that is anticipated before Biden's term concludes.

The Pentagon believes that China’s nuclear arsenal will rival the size and diversity of US and Russian stockpiles over the next decade, the Times reported.

“The president recently released updated guidance for nuclear weapons employment to address the presence of multiple nuclear-armed adversaries,” the newspaper cited Vipin Narang, a nuclear strategist from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) who previously worked at the Pentagon, as saying earlier this month before returning to academia.

He further noted that this guidance specifically considers “the significant increase in the size and diversity” of China’s nuclear arsenal, it added.

In June, the National Security Council’s senior director for arms control and nonproliferation, Pranay Vaddi, said Biden "recently issued updated nuclear weapons employment guidance, which takes into account the realities of a new nuclear era."

"It emphasizes the need to account for the growth and diversity of the PRC’s nuclear arsenal—and the need to deter Russia, the PRC and North Korea simultaneously," he added, referring to the People’s Republic of China, China’s official name.

White House National Security Council spokesperson Sean Savett told Anadolu that the US nuclear policy is updated regularly as part of their efforts to "reduce nuclear risks and maintain stable deterrence.”

"This administration—like the four administrations before it—issued a Nuclear Posture Review and Nuclear Weapons Employment Planning Guidance. 30, 2025](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/world/morning-briefing-aug-30-2025/3673279)

A Brookings article discusses Biden's nuclear policy and does not mention Biden ordering the US forces to prepare for possible nuclear confrontations with Russia, China, and North Korea.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Joe Biden, while serving as US President, approved a US nuclear strategy to prepare for possible nuclear confrontations with Russia, China, and North Korea. The Guardian reported this on August 20, 2024, and the Anadolu Agency reported on August 21, 2024, that Biden approved a classified document in March directing US forces to prepare for potential "coordinated nuclear confrontations" involving the mentioned countries.


## Final Judgement
The claim is supported by evidence from multiple sources, including The Guardian and Anadolu Agency, which report that President Biden approved a US nuclear strategy to prepare for possible nuclear confrontations with Russia, China, and North Korea. Therefore, the claim is factually accurate. `true`


## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
Based on reports from sources like *The Guardian* and *Anadolu Agency*, the claim is accurate. These sources indicate that President Joe Biden approved a US nuclear strategy to prepare for potential nuclear confrontations with Russia, China, and North Korea.

Some open-source estimates suggest that Ukraine had already lost nearly 40 Leopards, but those estimates are unconfirmed so far, according to the report. Russia repeatedly stated that arms supplies to Ukraine hinder the settlement and directly involve NATO countries in the conflict. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that the United States and NATO were directly involved in the conflict not only by providing weapons but also by training Ukrainian personnel in European countries.

Ukrainian Armed Forces destroyed in the Zaporozhye direction. Russian Defence Ministry / TASS

Moscow said Tuesday that it had captured several German Leopard tanks and U.S. Bradley infantry fighting vehicles, releasing footage showing Russian troops surveying the equipment supplied to Ukraine by Western countries.

"Leopard tanks and Bradley infantry fighting vehicles. These are our trophies. Equipment of the Ukrainian armed forces in the Zaporizhzhia region," the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement.

"Servicemen of the Vostok group inspect enemy tanks and infantry fighting vehicles captured in battle."

Kyiv has appealed to its allies in the West to deliver a broad range of modern military equipment to help Ukrainian forces recapture large swathes of territory controlled by Russian forces.

The Defense Ministry said several of the captured vehicles had working engines, suggesting that the battles they were involved in had been short and that Ukrainian troops had "fled" their offensive positions.

**(DEFENCE SECURITY ASIA) — During the week of May 11 to 17, Russian military claimed to have successfully destroyed five Leopard 2A1 tanks, manufactured by the German company Krauss-Maffei but donated to the Ukrainian Armed Forces to help the Eastern Europe country in its armed conflict with Russia.**

**In addition to the Leopard tanks, the Russian Ministry of Defense also alleged that 13 armored vehicles, 55 various vehicles, “Grad” multiple rocket launcher systems, and 47 artillery units—22 of which were supplied by foreign countries—were destroyed during this period.**

**Moreover, four Mi-24 helicopters and 40 unmanned boats belonging to the Ukrainian military were reportedly destroyed by Russia in the same timeframe.**

**Among the foreign-supplied armored vehicles to Ukraine, the Leopard tanks have been the most frequently supplied to Kyiv compared to other models such as the American-made Abrams and the British-made Challengers.**

**Since last year, countries such as Germany and several other European nations have supplied between 100-200 Leopard tanks to Ukraine for use in a spring counteroffensive against Russian positions.**

**“Russian Soldiers Pose in Front of Captured Leopard 2A6 Tank”**

**Line of Leopard tanks and Bradley armoured infantry fighting vehicle were destroyed in Zaphorizia, southern Ukraine.**

**Although the Ukrainian counteroffensive in 2023 initially started well, it faced increasingly formidable opposition from Russian forces who began altering their tactics and strategies.**

**These changes in strategy and tactics by the Russian forces led to the destruction of many of the Ukrainian tanks that had been supplied by donor countries like Germany, other European nations, the United States, and Britain.**

**However, to date, no one knows exactly how many Leopard tanks have been destroyed by Russia.**

**Nevertheless, Russian President Vladimir Putin has reportedly stated to his country’s war correspondents that Ukraine has lost more than 160 tanks supplied by foreign countries.**

**Given the high volume of Leopard tanks supplied to Ukraine, it is logical to conclude that many of the tanks destroyed by Russia were Leopard models.**

**Regarding the Abrams tanks, the Russian military stated that of the 31 American-made tanks supplied to Ukraine, more than five of the tanks have been destroyed by Russian forces.**

**A charred M1A1 Abrams main battle tank being transported to Moscow to participate in an exhibition at Victory Park.**

 **As a result of the destruction of five Abrams tanks, the United States has reportedly “withdrawn” these tanks from the Ukrainian battlefield, likely in an effort to “preserve its reputation.”**

**Following the destruction experienced by Leopard tanks supplied by Germany and other European countries, Ukraine’s Deputy Foreign Minister Andii Melnyk has requested that Kiev be supplied with more Leopard tanks, including the latest variant, the Leopard 2A6.**

 **However, the newest Leopard 2A6 variant supplied to Ukraine has met the same fate.**

**The Russian military reported capturing the most powerful tank in the Ukrainian arsenal, the German-made Leopard 2A6, after intense fighting in Avdiivka, Ukraine, last April.**

**It is believed that Ukraine possesses 21 Leopard 2A6 tanks, with 18 of these tanks developed by the companies Krauss-Maffei Wegmann and Rheinmetall being donated by Germany, while the remainder were provided by Portugal.**

**However, most of these Leopard 2A6 tanks donated to the Ukrainian military could not be used after failing to be properly maintained and remained inoperable as claimed by a senior German politician last January.**

**An Abrams tank caught fire after being struck by a Lancet kamikaze drone and an RPG from Russian forces.**

**According to Russian military sources, after capturing and removing the tank from the combat area, Russian forces transported the tank and sent it to Moscow, possibly for research purposes.**

**The Leopard 2A6 was successfully captured after a Russian platoon executed an ambush that caused the Ukrainian tank crew to abandon the German-made vehicle.**

**The Leopard 2A6 represents an upgrade from the Leopard 2A5, incorporating enhanced armor protection, firepower, and electronic warfare capabilities.**

**The tank measures 9.97 meters in length and weighs 62.3 tons, making it one of the heaviest main battle tanks ever deployed, with an engine power of 1,500 horsepower.**

**Capable of speeds up to 75 km/h and with an operational range of 500 km, it is equipped with a Rheinmetall 120 mm L/55 cannon, allowing it to fire all standard NATO ammunition types, including APFSDS, HEAT, and multi-purpose shells.**

**The Leopard 2A6 also features dual 7.62 mm MG3A1 machine guns and an advanced fire control system including a laser rangefinder, thermal imaging, and a ballistic computer. — DSA**

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Sunday that his forces had advanced up to 3 kilometres (1.86 miles) in Russia's Kursk region, taking control of two more settlements there.

Russia said it had struck Ukraine's 22nd and 115th Mechanized Brigades, the 82nd Airborne Assault Brigade, and a Guard and Support Brigade in at least 12 different places with air strikes, artillery and infantry.

Moscow said it had also repelled attacks at seven additional places in Kursk and had struck Ukrainian forces at 16 other locations in Ukraine's neighbouring Sumy region.

"Units of the northern group of forces, with the support of army aviation and artillery fire, repelled attacks by enemy assault groups in the direction of the settlements of Kremyanoye, Malaya Loknya and Nechayev," Russia's defence ministry said in a statement.

It said Russian forces had also "thwarted attempts to attack in the direction of Komarovka, Spalnoye, Korenevo, Pogrebky and Olgovka."

The ministry said it was seeking to identify and destroy Ukrainian sabotage units which had hidden in the forests in an attempt to penetrate deeper into Russian sovereign territory.

While the Kursk incursion has grabbed headlines, Russian officials say the attack will fail to draw Russian forces away from the east of Ukraine where they are still advancing. Reuters was unable to verify battlefield reports from either side.

Russia also gave estimates for Ukrainian losses in Kursk, but Reuters does not publish combatant estimates from either side.

No effect on the Pokrovsk front
-------------------------------

There was also increasing evidence that Moscow was having trouble stopping the Ukrainian counterinvasion in Kursk and was increasingly tapping elite units to do so.

Russian military reporters and geolocated footage have revealed that elements of the 810th and 155th naval infantry brigades, the 11th Airborne Brigade, and the 51st and 56th airborne regiments were redeployed to fight in Kursk.

The 810th and 155th naval infantry brigades had been fighting in Kharkiv, where Russia launched a new incursion in May. Sarantsev admitted that the Kursk action had had no effect on the Pokrovsk front.

Ukraine’s deep strikes against Russian military targets and its three-week-old ground offensive inside Russian territory have appeared to be yielding military and political results during the past week.

Russia was reported to be moving its aircraft back from airfields near the Ukrainian border while glide bomb attacks inside Ukraine were reported to have decreased. Life has the same value everywhere.”

Zelenskyy said he had discussed such a joint aerial defence with Lithuanian Prime Minister Ingrid Shimonite and Polish President Andrej Duda in Kyiv on August 24.

Taking the fight to Russia
--------------------------

While Ukraine seeks expanded authority and cooperation from its allies, it is also going its own way. It is believed prototypes of this missile may have been used against Russian-occupied Crimea in August 2023 to [destroy two S-400](/news/2024/2/12/for-ukraines-defence-industry-ambitions-the-skys-the-limit)
 air defence systems. Evidence that Moscow was scrambling elite units from Ukraine to defend home turf also mounted during the week.

An unnamed White House official told the Politico news website that “90 percent of the planes that launch glide bombs” against Ukrainian front-line positions had been moved back inside Russia.

![INTERACTIVE-ATTACK_ON_KURSK_AUG_28-1724833592](/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/INTERACTIVE-ATTACK_ON_KURSK_AUG_20-1724833592.png?w=770&resize=770%2C962&quality=80)

(Al Jazeera)

The independent analysis website Frontelligence agreed that “between the second half of June and mid-July, Russian forces relocated many valuable assets away from the Ukrainian border,” including planes and helicopters.

Ukrainian Colonel Vitaly Sarantsev told a joint news telethon broadcast by Ukrainian channels that the Kursk offensive had greatly reduced Russia’s use of aviation against northeastern Ukraine.

“We felt relief in tactical aviation,” he said on Sunday. If so, that would be a significant proportion of the more than 700,000 soldiers Russia is estimated to have in Ukraine.

The Washington, DC-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a think tank, estimated that Russia would need 60,000 soldiers to win back territory in Kursk once Ukrainian defences were dug. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy last week said it was a preemptive defence to prevent another Kharkiv-type invasion in the north.

But he also told Ukrainians it was “a way to compensate for the deficit in long-range capabilities”.

For months, Zelenskyy has implored the United States to allow Ukraine to use the [ATACMS long-range rocket artillery](/news/2024/8/23/which-countries-weapons-is-ukraine-using-in-russia-incursion)
 it provides to strike airfields deep inside Russia. He also wants the US to release Britain and France, for whose Storm Shadow missiles the US provides components, to authorise their use in the same way.

Currently, the US allows Ukraine to use its weapons to counter battery fire within a limited range across the border but not to hit Russian airfields because it is afraid that this could draw the US into the war.

![INTERACTIVE-WHO CONTROLS WHAT IN SOUTHERN UKRAINE-1724833604](/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/INTERACTIVE-WHO-CONTROLS-WHAT-IN-SOUTHERN-UKRAINE-1724833604.png?w=770&resize=770%2C770&quality=80)

(Al Jazeera)

In a recent analysis, the ISW identified that “at least 209 of 245 (more than 85 percent) known Russian military objects in range of ATACMS are not air bases” but ammunition depots, communications centres, army bases and command centres.

White House national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters on Monday that restrictions on the use of long-range weapons remain in place but “we’ll keep the conversations with the Ukrainians going” to potentially revise them.

The European Commission, which does not command military assets, has openly supported a lifting of restrictions.

The European Union’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, [repeated that support](/news/2024/8/29/eus-borrell-urges-ukraine-backers-to-lift-curbs-on-arms-use-inside-russia)
 on Monday and Thursday. “I reiterate that lifting restrictions on the use of capabilities against the Russian military involved in aggression against Ukraine, in accordance with international law, would strengthen Ukrainian self-defence, save lives and reduce destruction in Ukraine,” he said on Monday.

Russian officials bared their teeth against any such decision and hit out against the fact that both Brussels and Washington have allowed the use of US and European equipment in Ukraine’s Kursk offensive.

“The West does not want to avoid escalation."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim that the image shows destroyed Ukrainian tanks during Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024 is supported by the evidence. The web search confirms that an incursion did occur in August 2024. Reuters reported that Russia said Ukraine had lost 73 tanks in the Kursk region.

The reverse image search confirms that the image is related to the conflict. The evidence does not explicitly state that the tanks in the image are Ukrainian.

Based on the evidence, the claim is likely true. However, the exact origin of the tanks in the image is not confirmed.
