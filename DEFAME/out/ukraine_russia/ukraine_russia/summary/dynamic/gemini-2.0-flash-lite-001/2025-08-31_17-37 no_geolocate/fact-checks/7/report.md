## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The claim that BlackRock has asked that Ukrainian soldiers not be buried on land it owns in Ukraine is false. The claim originated from a Bulgarian politician and was shared by Russian and Chinese media, according to an article from Asia Fact Check Lab ([https://www.rfa.org/english/news/afcl/afcl-blackrock-ukraine-land-08262024030948.html](https://www.rfa.org/english/news/afcl/afcl-blackrock-ukraine-land-08262024030948.html)). Myth Detector also states that the claim is false and originated from a satirical Telegram channel ([https://mythdetector.com/en/ukrainian-lands-and-banned-the-burial-of-military-personnel/](https://mythdetector.com/en/ukrainian-lands-and-banned-the-burial-of-military-personnel/)).

The Oakland Institute published a report on the takeover of Ukraine's agricultural land, but it does not mention BlackRock's policy on the burial of Ukrainian soldiers ([https://tlio.org.uk/war-and-theft-the-hostile-takeover-of-ukraines-agricultural-land-private-equitys-21st-century-war-for-global-enclosure-and-slavery/](https://tlio.org.uk/war-and-theft-the-hostile-takeover-of-ukraines-agricultural-land-private-equitys-21st-century-war-for-global-enclosure-and-slavery/)).
