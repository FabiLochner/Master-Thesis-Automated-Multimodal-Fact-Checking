## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The IMF website provides information about Russia, including its membership date, quota, and Special Drawing Rights, and includes a link to the July 2025 World Economic Outlook Update, which projects a 0.9% change in real GDP for 2025 (![image 2695](media/2025-08-07_21-00-1754600446-931830.jpg)). According to russiamatters.org, the IMF ranks Russia as the world's 4th largest economy in terms of PPP. The article mentions that in December 2024, Russia's budget revenues reached more than 4 trillion rubles ($40 billion), the highest level recorded since January 2011 (<image:k>).

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the IMF provides information about Russia's economy, including projections for GDP growth. Additionally, russiamatters.org states that the IMF ranks Russia as the world's 4th largest economy in terms of PPP. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the IMF declared Russia the fourth-largest economy in the world in October 2024.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified with the provided evidence. The exact date of the IMF's ranking and the specific criteria used (e.g., PPP or nominal GDP) are not explicitly stated in the evidence.
