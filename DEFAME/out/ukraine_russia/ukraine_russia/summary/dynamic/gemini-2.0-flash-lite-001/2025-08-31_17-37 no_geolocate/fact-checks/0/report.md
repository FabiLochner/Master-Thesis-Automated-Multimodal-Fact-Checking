## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Penrith City Library lists the Hull Daily Mail from March 13, 2025, as a valid source ([https://penrithcity.spydus.com/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/WPAC/ISSENQ?SETLVL=&ISX=142144](https://penrithcity.spydus.com/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/WPAC/ISSENQ?SETLVL=&ISX=142144)). However, mythdetector.com states that the image of the Hull Daily Mail frontpage is falsified, and the actual March 13, 2025, issue does not mention Ukraine (![image 66](media/2025-08-06_17-26-1754501162-718406.jpg), ![image 44](media/2025-08-06_17-25-1754501124-685634.jpg), ![image 66](media/2025-08-06_17-26-1754501162-718406.jpg)) and was published on March 17, 2025 ([https://mythdetector.com/en/british-hull-daily-mail/](https://mythdetector.com/en/british-hull-daily-mail/)).

Magzter also shows the Hull Daily Mail from March 13, 2025, with a different front page headline ([https://www.magzter.com/GB/Reach-Publishing-Services-Limited/Hull-Daily-Mail/News/2023954?srsltid=AfmBOoqTSROYXfWSCNnJjzNlPL-FwMP5Yq_k0ESWpru9Vq4oC3aQXhx2](https://www.magzter.com/GB/Reach-Publishing-Services-Limited/Hull-Daily-Mail/News/2023954?srsltid=AfmBOoqTSROYXfWSCNnJjzNlPL-FwMP5Yq_k0ESWpru9Vq4oC3aQXhx2)) (![image 73](media/2025-08-06_17-26-1754501202-576951.jpg)).


### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results indicate that the image of the Hull Daily Mail front page from March 13, 2025, with the headline "70,000 Ukrainian soldiers in the Kursk region died in vain" is fake. Gwara Media ([Source](https://gwaramedia.com/en/debunking-russian-fakes-hull-daily-mail-didnt-write-about-70000-ukrainian-soldiers-killed-in-russias-kursk-oblast/)) and The Journal.ie ([Source](https://www.thejournal.ie/ukraine-hull-daily-mail-debunk-6657051-Mar2025/)) both debunked the image, stating that the real front page had a different headline. ![image 1451](media/2025-08-07_13-39-1754573946-256635.jpg), ![image 1454](media/2025-08-07_13-39-1754573951-547510.jpg), ![image 1470](media/2025-08-07_13-41-1754574071-817295.jpg), ![image 1471](media/2025-08-07_13-41-1754574072-732356.jpg), ![image 1472](media/2025-08-07_13-41-1754574075-181803.jpg)


## Elaboration
The claim is false. Multiple sources, including mythdetector.com, Gwara Media, and The Journal.ie, have debunked the image of the Hull Daily Mail front page as fabricated. The actual front page from March 13, 2025, featured a different headline.


## Final Judgement
The claim is demonstrably false as the image of the Hull Daily Mail front page is fabricated. The real front page from March 13, 2025, had a different headline.
