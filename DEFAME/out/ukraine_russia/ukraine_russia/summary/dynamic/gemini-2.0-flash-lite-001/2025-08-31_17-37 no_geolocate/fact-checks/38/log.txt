Useful result: From [Source](https://apnews.com/article/zelenskyy-johnson-ambassador-ukraine-biden-harris-trump-d81b0a055d99cfd4804b3f2c00915d09): 
Content: The Associated Press reports that House Speaker Mike Johnson called for the removal of Ukraine's ambassador to the U.S. after Zelenskyy's visit to a Pennsylvania ammunition plant. Johnson called the visit a "partisan campaign event designed to help Democrats" and "clearly election interference." The article mentions that James Comer is investigating whether the Biden-Harris administration used taxpayer funds to fly Zelenskyy to Pennsylvania as a campaign event for Kamala Harris. The Pentagon stated that the flight was funded by the Defense Department for official business. The article also mentions that Trump criticized Zelenskyy.

The claim 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy engaged in election interference by campaigning in Pennsylvania for Kamala Harris ahead of the US presidential election in 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is based on interpretations of Volodymyr Zelenskyy's visit to a munitions factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania, which some Republicans, including Mike Johnson, viewed as a campaign event for Kamala Harris and potential election interference. However, the evidence, including reports from sources like [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/25/zelenskyy-insulted-him-house-gop-to-probe-ukraine-leaders-pa-trip-.html) and [AP News](https://apnews.com/article/zelenskyy-johnson-ambassador-ukraine-biden-harris-trump-d81b0a055d99cfd4804b3f2c00915d09), does not provide definitive proof that Zelenskyy was explicitly campaigning for Harris, and the Pentagon stated the visit was for official business.

So, the overall veracity is: false
