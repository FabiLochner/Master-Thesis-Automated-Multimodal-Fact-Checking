### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-ap-top-news-ca-state-wire-adam-schiff-politics-3eec3ea9be5c07a9c297bad439f8f3e8): 
Content: The Associated Press published an article about Adam Schiff, mentioning his role as the lead impeachment prosecutor against Donald Trump. <image:i> The article states that Schiff has been a frequent target of conservatives since the then GOP-led House Intelligence Committee started investigating Trumpâ€™s ties to Russia in the 2016 election.


## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim that John Thune blocked Adam Schiff's committee assignments because of his past work in the Russia investigation. The search results mention committee assignments for both senators but do not indicate any blocking. One article mentions Schiff's role in the Russia investigation, but it does not link this to any action by Thune regarding committee assignments.

The provided evidence is insufficient to verify the claim. More information is needed to confirm whether Thune took any action to block Schiff's committee assignments and the reasons behind such actions.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Schiff): 
Content: The Wikipedia article on Adam Schiff states that he was removed from the House Intelligence Committee by Kevin McCarthy. It also mentions that Schiff was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2024.

### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://scdailygazette.com/2025/01/03/repub/in-first-speech-as-u-s-senate-majority-leader-thune-pledges-to-protect-filibuster/): 
Content: The article from scdailygazette.com, published on January 3, 2025, reports on John Thune's first speech as U.S. Senate Majority Leader. <image:i> Thune pledged to protect the filibuster. The article mentions Adam Schiff and Andy Kim took their oaths in December. The article does not mention Thune blocking Schiff's committee assignments.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Adam Schiff was removed from the House Intelligence Committee by Kevin McCarthy. However, the evidence does not support the claim that John Thune blocked Adam Schiff's committee assignments. The search results show that Thune is the Senate Majority Leader and that Schiff was assigned to committees. The evidence does not provide any statement from Thune regarding Schiff's committee assignments. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that while Adam Schiff faced removal from a House committee, there's no evidence to suggest John Thune blocked his committee assignments. The search results show Schiff's assignments and Thune's role as Senate Majority Leader, but no indication of Thune taking action to block Schiff. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the available evidence. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is not supported by the evidence. While Adam Schiff was removed from the House Intelligence Committee by Kevin McCarthy, there is no evidence that John Thune blocked Schiff's committee assignments. The search results show Schiff's committee assignments and Thune's role as Senate Majority Leader, but no indication of Thune taking action to block Schiff's assignments.
