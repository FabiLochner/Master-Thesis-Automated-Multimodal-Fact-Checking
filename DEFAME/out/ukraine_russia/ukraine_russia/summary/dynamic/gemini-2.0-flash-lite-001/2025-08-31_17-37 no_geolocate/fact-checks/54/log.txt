Content: PBS Frontline World discusses illicit weapons, high-level corruption, and organized crime centered in Ukraine. Ukraine inherited huge stockpiles of arms after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. The Ukrainian government must do more to clean up its arms exports industry. Ukraine is notorious for its booming legal arms industry. Between 1992 and 1998, Ukraine lost $32 billion in military assets, in part through theft, discount arms sales, and lack of oversight. Theft and corruption in the military facilitated the flow of illegal weapons from Ukraine. <image:k>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1294319/ukraine-arms-exports-by-country/): 
Content: The Statista website, in cooperation with SIPRI, published a report in March 2025 on arms imports from Ukraine from 2018 to 2024, by country. The report shows the value of arms exports from Ukraine to various countries, including China, Saudi Arabia, and India. <image:13121>. The report does not provide any data to support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States.

Useful result: From [Source](https://tradingeconomics.com/ukraine/weapons-sales): 
Content: The search result from Trading Economics states that Ukraine's weapons sales decreased to 23 SIPRI TIV Million in 2024 from 29 SIPRI TIV Million in 2023. The source is SIPRI.

The claim 'Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While Ukraine is a major arms importer, with the U.S. as a primary supplier, there is no evidence to support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. In fact, Ukraine's arms sales have decreased, according to [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/ukraine/arms-exports).

So, the overall veracity is: false
