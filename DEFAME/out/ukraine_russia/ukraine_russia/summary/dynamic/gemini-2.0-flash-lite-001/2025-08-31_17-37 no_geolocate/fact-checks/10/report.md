## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (![image 8](media/10.jpg)) appears in articles discussing a Russian strike on Kyiv on July 8, 2024. The Kyiv Independent published an article on July 9, 2024, reporting that the body of a boy was found under the rubble of a building hit by a Russian strike in Kyiv's Schevchenkyvskyi district on July 8, 2024. The article states that the attack brought the death toll to 27, including four children. News Ukraine published an article on August 6, 2024, discussing a Russian missile attack on Kyiv on July 8, 2024, which hit the Okhmatdyt Children's Hospital, and that 27 people, including 4 children, were killed.

The articles can be found at [https://kyivindependent.com/boys-body-found-under-rubble-in-kyiv/](https://kyivindependent.com/boys-body-found-under-rubble-in-kyiv/) and [https://newsukraine.rbc.ua/news/russian-strike-on-kyiv-number-of-killed-and-1720503127.html](https://newsukraine.rbc.ua/news/russian-strike-on-kyiv-number-of-killed-and-1720503127.html).


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the image is related to a Russian strike on Kyiv on July 8, 2024, which resulted in casualties, including children. The Kyiv Independent and News Ukraine reported on the event, mentioning the discovery of a child's body and the attack on the Okhmatdyt Children's Hospital.

The evidence does not provide information about the image being photoshopped or the toys being fake.

To verify the claim, additional information is needed to confirm whether the toys in the image were photoshopped.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Al Jazeera and The Guardian reported on the Russian missile strikes on Kyiv, including the Okhmatdyt children's hospital on July 8, 2024. The articles mention casualties and show images of the aftermath of the attack, but do not mention anything about photoshopped images or fake toys. The Guardian article states that the strikes killed 38 people, including four children. The Al Jazeera article mentions a strike on Okhmatdyt National Childrenâ€™s Specialised Hospital, with dozens killed and wounded. (![image 1](media/0.jpg)

## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim that the image shows photoshopped toys. While the evidence confirms the Russian attack on the Okhmatdyt children's hospital in Kyiv on July 8, 2024, and the presence of casualties, it does not mention anything about the image being manipulated or the toys being fake. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.


## Final Judgement
The image is related to the Russian attack on Kyiv on July 8, 2024, which hit the Okhmatdyt Children's Hospital. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that the toys in the image were photoshopped. Therefore, the claim is not factually accurate. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim that the image depicts photoshopped toys after a Russian attack on a Kyiv hospital on July 8, 2024, is not supported by the evidence. While the attack did occur, as reported by sources like the [Kyiv Independent](https://kyivindependent.com/boys-body-found-under-rubble-in-kyiv/) and [News Ukraine](https://newsukraine.rbc.ua/news/russian-strike-on-kyiv-number-of-killed-and-1720503127.html), there is no information to suggest the image was manipulated or that the toys were fake.
