### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results discuss the relationship between Volodymyr Zelenskyy and US politics. One source discusses the 2019 Trumpâ€“Ukraine scandal, including a phone call where Trump asked Zelenskyy to investigate Joe Biden, and a 2022 visit by Zelenskyy to the United States (<image:k>). Another source mentions a 2019 call where Trump pushed Zelenskyy to investigate Joe Biden ahead of the 2020 election (<image:k>).

A September 25, 2024, article in The Guardian discusses a visit by Zelenskyy to a munitions factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania, where he thanked workers. Mike Johnson claimed this event was a "partisan campaign event designed to help Democrats" and "clearly election interference." The Pennsylvania governor, Josh Shapiro, attended the event (![image 5542](media/2025-08-29_14-23-1756477426-922140.jpg)).

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that there is a dispute over whether Zelenskyy engaged in election interference. Some Republicans, including JD Vance and Mike Johnson, have accused Zelenskyy of campaigning for Kamala Harris, citing his visit to a munitions factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania, as a partisan event. However, the evidence does not provide definitive proof that Zelenskyy was explicitly campaigning for Harris. The claim is based on interpretations of Zelenskyy's actions and statements.

The evidence shows that Zelenskyy met with Harris and other lawmakers, and his visit to Pennsylvania was attended by the state's governor. These events have been interpreted by some as a sign of preference in the upcoming election.

The available information is insufficient to definitively verify the claim. More information is needed to determine Zelenskyy's intentions and whether his actions constituted election interference.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that House Republicans are investigating Zelenskyy's visit to a Pennsylvania ammunition factory, viewing it as a campaign event for Kamala Harris and potential election interference. Mike Johnson called the visit a "partisan campaign event." However, the Pentagon stated that the visit was funded by the Defense Department for official business. The claim is based on interpretations of Zelenskyy's actions, and the evidence does not provide definitive proof that Zelenskyy was explicitly campaigning for Harris.


## Final Judgement
The claim that Volodymyr Zelenskyy engaged in election interference by campaigning in Pennsylvania for Kamala Harris is based on interpretations of his actions, specifically his visit to a munitions factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania. While some Republicans have accused him of such interference, there is no definitive proof that Zelenskyy was explicitly campaigning for Harris. The visit was funded by the Defense Department for official business.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is based on interpretations of Volodymyr Zelenskyy's visit to a munitions factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania, which some Republicans, including Mike Johnson, viewed as a campaign event for Kamala Harris and potential election interference. However, the evidence, including reports from sources like [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/25/zelenskyy-insulted-him-house-gop-to-probe-ukraine-leaders-pa-trip-.html) and [AP News](https://apnews.com/article/zelenskyy-johnson-ambassador-ukraine-biden-harris-trump-d81b0a055d99cfd4804b3f2c00915d09), does not provide definitive proof that Zelenskyy was explicitly campaigning for Harris, and the Pentagon stated the visit was for official business.
