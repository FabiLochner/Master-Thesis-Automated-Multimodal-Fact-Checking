### Evidence from `web_search`
In March 2025, Lech Wałęsa wrote a letter to Donald Trump criticizing his treatment of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The letter was signed by dozens of former Polish political prisoners and expressed concerns about Trump's leniency towards Vladimir Putin. The letter was posted on Facebook.

NPR published an article on March 5, 2025, reporting on the letter, while Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/polish-cold-war-hero-walesa-writes-trump-expressing-horror-zelenskiy-spat-2025-03-03/](https://www.reuters.com/world/polish-cold-war-hero-walesa-writes-trump-expressing-horror-zelenskiy-spat-2025-03-03/)) and the Los Angeles Times ([https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-03-03/polish-democracy-hero-walesa-says-trump-treatment-of-zelensky-filled-him-with-horror](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-03-03/polish-democracy-hero-walesa-says-trump-treatment-of-zelensky-filled-him-with-horror)) also reported on the letter. ![image 1961](media/2025-08-07_19-24-1754594678-260321.jpg) ![image 1962](media/2025-08-07_19-24-1754594684-890174.jpg) <image:i>


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Lech Wałęsa wrote a letter to Donald Trump in March 2025. The letter criticized Trump's treatment of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, expressing concerns about Trump's stance towards Vladimir Putin. The evidence does not explicitly mention the suspension of U.S. military aid to Ukraine as the primary focus of Wałęsa's criticism.

The letter was signed by dozens of former Polish political prisoners and was reported by multiple news outlets, including Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/polish-cold-war-hero-walesa-writes-trump-expressing-horror-zelenskiy-spat-2025-03-03/](https://www.reuters.com/world/polish-cold-war-hero-walesa-writes-trump-expressing-horror-zelenskiy-spat-2025-03-03/)) and the Los Angeles Times ([https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-03-03/polish-democracy-hero-walesa-says-trump-treatment-of-zelensky-filled-him-with-horror](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-03-03/polish-democracy-hero-walesa-says-trump-treatment-of-zelensky-filled-him-with-horror)).

The claim is partially supported, as Wałęsa did write a letter to Trump in March 2025. However, the evidence does not confirm that the letter specifically criticized the suspension of U.S. military aid to Ukraine.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that Lech Wałęsa wrote a letter to Donald Trump in March 2025, criticizing Trump's treatment of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the letter criticized the suspension of U.S. military aid to Ukraine.

Since the claim is not entirely accurate because the evidence does not support the specific reason for the criticism, the most appropriate decision option is `false`.


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
In March 2025, Lech Wałęsa wrote a letter to Donald Trump, as reported by Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/polish-cold-war-hero-walesa-writes-trump-expressing-horror-zelenskiy-spat-2025-03-03/](https://www.reuters.com/world/polish-cold-war-hero-walesa-writes-trump-expressing-horror-zelenskiy-spat-2025-03-03/)) and the Los Angeles Times ([https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-03-03/polish-democracy-hero-walesa-says-trump-treatment-of-zelensky-filled-him-with-horror](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-03-03/polish-democracy-hero-walesa-says-trump-treatment-of-zelensky-filled-him-with-horror)). The letter criticized Trump's treatment of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, but the evidence does not confirm that the letter specifically addressed the suspension of U.S. military aid to Ukraine.
