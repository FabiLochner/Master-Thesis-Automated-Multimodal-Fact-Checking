## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Several sources debunk a video alleging that USAID paid Hollywood celebrities to visit Ukraine. The BBC ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0m12wl0jwpo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0m12wl0jwpo)) and The Hollywood Reporter ([https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/politics-news/fake-online-usaid-paid-hollywood-stars-debunked-1236129713/](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/politics-news/fake-online-usaid-paid-hollywood-stars-debunked-1236129713/)) identified the video as Russian disinformation. The video falsely claimed USAID paid Angelina Jolie, Sean Penn, Jean Claude Van Damme, Orlando Bloom, and Ben Stiller.

Ben Stiller denied the claims, stating he self-funded his trip, as confirmed by Vanity Fair ([https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/ben-stiller-denies-elon-musks-retweet-claiming-usaid-funded-the-stars-trip-to-ukraine?srsltid=AfmBOooGw1dpqnug2OYCP6ztL_oyb-nbLtgTwlK9XIbCoPDkIdmO6uAz](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/ben-stiller-denies-elon-musks-retweet-claiming-usaid-funded-the-stars-trip-to-ukraine?srsltid=AfmBOooGw1dpqnug2OYCP6ztL_oyb-nbLtgTwlK9XIbCoPDkIdmO6uAz)). The video was falsely attributed to "eonline.com," which was dismissed by E! News-parent NBCUniversal.

The video was identified as disinformation, and the claim was falsely attributed to "eonline.com," which was dismissed by E! News-parent NBCUniversal. Ben Stiller denied the claims, stating he self-funded his trip, as confirmed by Vanity Fair ([https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/ben-stiller-denies-elon-musks-retweet-claiming-usaid-funded-the-stars-trip-to-ukraine?srsltid=AfmBOooGw1dpqnug2OYCP6ztL_oyb-nbLtgTwlK9XIbCoPDkIdmO6uAz](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/ben-stiller-denies-elon-musks-retweet-claiming-usaid-funded-the-stars-trip-to-ukraine?srsltid=AfmBOooGw1dpqnug2OYCP6ztL_oyb-nbLtgTwlK9XIbCoPDkIdmO6uAz)).
