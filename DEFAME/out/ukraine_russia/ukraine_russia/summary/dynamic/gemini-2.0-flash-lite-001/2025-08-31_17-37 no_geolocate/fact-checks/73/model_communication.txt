An F-16 Fighting Falcon rests inside a warehouse near March Air Reserve Base after crashing on May 16, 2019. The missiles on board did not explode. The plane suffered a loss of hydraulic pressure, rendering the pilot unable to control the jet, the U.S. Air Force said April 23, 2020. (Courtesy of U.S. Air Force)

The U.S. Air Force has answered a questioned that burned in people’s minds as bystanders were hurriedly pushed back to safer locations several times and the 215 Freeway was closed after [the crash of an Air National Guard F-16 fighter jet](https://www.pressenterprise.com/2019/05/16/plane-crashes-near-march-air-reserve-base-215-freeway-shut-down/)
 near March Air Reserve Base in 2019:

Why didn’t the missiles aboard the Flying Falcon explode on impact?

The reason, the Air Force said this week, is that the ordnance attached to the F-16 during its intercept training mission were never armed.

“Aircraft flying this mission do fly with live ordnance. In order for the weapons to detonate, there are multiple conditions that must be met, including arming and launching of the weapon to complete the detonation sequences,” said Capt. Tisha J. Yates, an Air Force spokeswoman at Joint Base Langley-Eustis in Virginia.

The missiles were eventually removed from the jet as it sat in a warehouse on Opportunity Way near the Riverside-Moreno Valley border. They were trucked to nearby Ben Clark Training Center, [where they were destroyed in a controlled detonation](https://www.pressenterprise.com/2019/05/17/x-9/)
.

“The determination to move civilians away from the scene was a safety measure put in place by the incident commander on scene and in coordination with NORAD based on the hazards present until all munitions were secured,” Yates said in response to questions from this news organization, [which first reported the cause of the crash](https://www.pressenterprise.com/2020/04/23/hydraulic-failure-caused-f-16-to-crash-near-march-base-last-year-air-force-says/)
.

The F-16 was assigned to the 114th Fighter Wing at Joe Foss Field in South Dakota. The pilot was attached to the 144th Fighter Wing at March.

On May 16, 2019, the pilot was returning from the two-jet maneuvers about 120 miles east of March when he lost hydraulic pressure and therefore the ability to control the aircraft. At 3:39 p.m., after burning off fuel, he ejected about 250 feet off the ground less than a mile from the base. The pilot suffered minor injuries, as did about a dozen people in the warehouse where the plane crashed.

The Air Force concluded in its 22-page accident report that the $24 million jet lost the fluid from its two hydraulic tanks when two inlet check valves — each less than an inch tall — failed because they were improperly installed.

Each valve consists of a cap, screw threads, a retainer ring and an O-ring that collectively are referred to as a screw cap. That screw cap screws into the valve body. The retainer helps keep the O-ring in place. It is primarily the screw cap retainer and O-ring that prevent hydraulic fluid from leaking under high pressure.

The investigation determined that both screw caps were not properly screwed into the valve bodies. The retainers were found to be deformed, and portions of the O-rings were missing. As a result, hydraulic fluid leaked out through the threads between the screw caps and the valve bodies.

A suspected hydraulic leak had been noted in the jet in March 2019. A new flight-control system that had been overhauled months earlier was installed on March 28, and the plane flew 10 more missions without incident before the crash. The report concluded that the overhaul process lacked “an effective procedure to identify improper installation of ISA check valves.” ISA stands for Integrated Servo Actuator, a flight-control system.

In the wake of the crash, the Air Force also said this week that it studied the overhaul process and found a problem with how the inlet check valve was assembled during overhauls, said Derek Kaufman, a civilian spokesman for the Air Force Materiel Command at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio.

There are two approved configurations of the valves. The older configuration uses smaller Teflon backing rings, and newer configurations use larger rings. The team discovered the potential for installation of the wrong-size backing ring since both size rings were packaged side by side, Kaufman said.

As a result, the Air Force changed the process for assembling the valves during overhauls. It separated the installation and inspection steps on the work documentation and added a secondary quality check for just O-ring backing ring installation. And it inserted a “quality stamp” of the entire process for the first six months after the changes to ensure proper training was accomplished.

The Air Force also inspected all of its inlet check valves and found three to be defective. Those were fixed, Kaufman said.

“We review the facts for any lessons that can be applied to maintenance processes and training to improve the safety and quality of systems we deliver to our warfighters,” he said.

The improper installation of two parts caused an [F-16](/weapons/f-16/ "Learn more about the F-16 Fighting Falcon")
‘s hydraulic system to fail, making the pilot [lose control and crash into a warehouse in May 2019](https://www.airforcemag.com/f-16-crashes-during-norad-training-in-california/)
 while flying back to March Air Reserve Base, Calif., Air Force investigators found.

The F-16 pilot successfully ejected before the Viper crashed into the civilian building. The aircraft was destroyed at a loss of $24.99 million, and caused about $3.9 million in damage to the warehouse, according to an Air Combat Command Accident Investigation Board report.

The F-16C, tail number 88-0477 from the South Dakota Air National Guard’s 114th Fighter Wing, was operated by a pilot from the California Air National Guard’s 144th Fighter Wing Detachment 1 at March for homeland defense missions. On May 16, 2019, the F-16C took off as part of a two-ship formation for an aerospace control alert training mission in a nearby military operating area.

The two F-16s flew one-versus-one tactical intercepts, low-level proficiency training, and local area familiarization. While flying near Palm Springs, the pilot began receiving cockpit warnings of a potential hydraulic system issue with gauges showing low pressure and began going through appropriate checklists, according to the report.

About 20 miles from base, the pilot deployed speed brakes and lowered the landing gear to burn more fuel and let the wingman visually inspect the aircraft. With the speed brakes and gear deployed and locked, the pilot did not yet declare an emergency, but continued the approach to March, the report states.

The aircraft then indicated further loss of pressure in both of its “A and B” systems, and the pilot consulted checklists for dual hydraulic failure. Once they got close to the base, the wingman landed first on one of the base’s runways, allowing the damaged F-16 to land on a runway with an arresting cable.

With both hydraulic systems failing, the pilot declared an emergency and turned on emergency power as a precaution before starting a straight-in approach to the runway. About one mile before touching down, at about 300 feet above ground level, the F-16 began to roll to the left without any pilot input. The pilot tried to maintain control, and counter the roll, but the aircraft rolled hard to the right in a way that was inconsistent with the pilot’s input.

After losing control of the aircraft, the pilot ejected. Immediately after punching out, the F-16 crashed into the warehouse, located across a major highway from the base. A photograph of the impact shows the F-16’s nose sheared off and wings largely removed in a pile of boxes and equipment. The pilot parachuted onto the runway overrun at the base, and was briefly hospitalized with minor injuries.

The Accident Investigation Board found that the cause of the mishap was two improperly installed hydraulic check valves in the aircraft’s right flaperon integrated survoactuator—a part that translates electrical commands to the movement of flight control surfaces. For both of the parts that failed, investigators found the same problem: the retainer on a screw cap had deformed, with fragments tearing away allowing fluid to leak.

“This condition allowed hydraulic fluid to leak from both systems resulting in decreased hydraulic pressure to move flight control surfaces,” the report said. “The \[pilot\] set up to land as soon as possible, but the system had lost enough pressure on final approach to prevent the \[aircraft\] from sustaining controlled flight.”

Maintainers with the 144th Fighter Wing Detachment 1 installed the parts as part of unscheduled maintenance in March 2019 after a possible hydraulic leak was discovered. The parts went through operational checks with no discrepancies found, and the aircraft had flown 10 sorties for 16.3 hours before the crash. The AIB states that there was an inadequate overhaul process, which lacked an effective procedure to identify problems with the installation of the check valves.

An inlet check valve from the F-16 Fighting Falcon that crashed near March Air Reserve Base on May 16, 2019, is shown during the investigation into the crash. The U.S. Air Force concluded that the valve was improperly installed, leading to a leak of hydraulic fuel that rendered the pilot unable to control the aircraft. (Courtesy of U.S. Air Force)

A loss of hydraulic pressure prevented the pilot of the Air National Guard’s F-16 [that crashed near March Air Reserve Base](https://www.pe.com/2019/05/16/plane-crashes-near-march-air-reserve-base-215-freeway-shut-down/)
 last year from controlling the jet, the U.S. Air Force says in a report.

The pilot ejected and parachuted onto a base runway on May 16, 2019, suffering minor injuries. The $24 million Fighting Falcon plummeted through the roof of a warehouse, destroying the jet and causing a small fire.

Twelve people in the warehouse were treated for exposure to the debris, the Cal Fire/Riverside County Fire Department said at the time.

The 22-page report, dated April 14, said two inlet-check valves were improperly installed, resulting in damage to them that caused hydraulic fuel to leak.

The valves were part of a flight-control system that was overhauled in January 2019 and installed in the jet after a possible hydraulic leak was discovered several months later.

“The evidence also indicated an inadequate overhaul process that lacked an effective procedure to identify improper installation of ISA check valves,” the report says.

The F-16 was one of two jets initially practicing 120 miles east of March, which sits on the Riverside-Moreno Valley border. The planes were returning to March when the one jet lost hydraulic pressure.

The pilot burned off fuel before ejecting, the report says.

The F-16 was assigned to the 114th Fighter Wing at Joe Foss Field in South Dakota and ran some missions for the 144th Fighter Wing at March.

1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

Video shows explosions after drone attack on Russian ammunition depot

00:58

CNN  — 

A Ukrainian drone attack launched overnight destroyed an ammunition depot in the western Russian region of Tver, a source from Ukraine’s Security Service (SBU) told CNN on Wednesday, causing a massive blast.

The Ukrainian drones targeted the Russian defense ministry-operated warehouse in the city of Toropets, which was storing Iskander tactical missile systems, Tochka-U tactical missile systems, guided aerial bombs and artillery ammunition, the source said.

Large fires broke out from the debris of drones repelled by local air defenses, the regional government said, prompting the governor, Igor Rudenya, to order a partial evacuation of the area during the early hours of Wednesday.

Earthquake monitors now believe explosions from the drone attack may have generated seismic activity. Ben Dando, a seismologist at the Norwegian seismology research foundation NORSAR, told CNN that its sensors “detected seismic signals, of magnitude 2.5 to 2.8, in northwest Russia which look to be associated with the drone attack launched by Ukraine.”

NORSAR, which has been using seismic monitors since 2022 to evaluate the impact of the war in Ukraine, is currently analyzing the preliminary data to capture the full extent of the blast, Dando added.

Satellite images taken by Maxar Technologies on Wednesday morning showed huge plumes of smoke rising up from several depot buildings, as well as extensive damage to the buildings and nearby forest.

Fires continue to burn, as seen in the Maxar Technologies images.

Russian state news agency TASS reported that a drone attack had been launched on the city of Toropets overnight causing a fire “due to the fall of debris,” without specifically mentioning any targeting of a weapons facility.

Videos circulating on social media, verified by CNN, showed loud detonations and multiple buildings in the depot complex on fire.

Affected residents, including 11 children, have already been evacuated to the settlements of Kunya and Velikiye Luki in the neighbouring Pskov region, TASS said. No civilians are thought to have been injured in the drone attack, the news agency reported, citing Rudenya.

“Now we are engaged in evacuating the population, residents, maintaining public order,” Rudenya said in a later video statement, stressing that multiple emergency service units were involved in the response.

Rudenya made the call to evacuate so emergency services at the scene could work fully to bring the blazes under control, the local government said in a post on its official Telegram channel.

The Ukrainian security source told CNN that attacks of this nature are being used “methodically” to reduce Russia’s missile potential, adding that plans for further attacks on “similar” Russian military facilities are “proceeding.”

Toropets is located around 300 miles from the Ukrainian border and about 250 miles west of Moscow.

Ukraine has been pushing its key allies, including the United States, to give the go-ahead to carry out missile strikes on targets deeper into Russian territory. Last week, Russian President Vladimir Putin [warned NATO members](https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/12/europe/putin-warns-nato-missiles-hnk-latam-intl/index.html)
 that lifting restrictions on Ukraine’s use of long-range missile systems would mean entering into war with Russia itself.

Renovated in 2018, the facility in Toropets is estimated to have stored tonnes upon tonnes of military goods, including explosives, artillery shells and ballistic missiles.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A Ukrainian drone attack on a significant Russian weapons stockpile in the Tver region in the early hours of Wednesday might be the Ukrainian army's biggest hit against Moscow's arsenal since early 2022.

The blast from the strike was so strong that earthquake monitoring stations picked it up as if it were a minor earthquake, while NASA reported a series of heat sources spotted by its equipment from space.

The facility in Toropets is estimated to have stored around 30,000 tonnes of military munitions. The destruction of the ammunition that was stored there will most likely negatively affect the northern operational group of the Russian army.

But what is the Russian military storage facility in Toropets and how important is it?

Renovated in 2018, the facility in Toropets is estimated to have stored tonnes upon tonnes of military goods, including explosives, artillery shells and ballistic missiles.

The former Russian deputy defence minister Dmitry Bulgakov — who was arrested earlier this year on corruption charges — said after the renovations that the site met the "highest international standards" and could defend weapons from missiles and "even a small nuclear attack".

The storage site covered an area of over 5 square kilometres in size and a perimeter of more than 12 kilometres long. 

**Which missiles were stored at the facility?**
-----------------------------------------------

The town of Toropets is situated around 470 kilometers north of the Ukrainian border and the destruction of the ammunition that was stored there will most likely negatively affect the northern operational group of the Russian army, including the supply of troops in Kursk, Belgorod and Bryansk.

According to Ukrainian sources, the military site in Toropets reportedly housed fuel tanks, as well as missiles intended for Iskander missile systems, Tochka-U missile systems, guided aerial bombs and assorted artillery ammunition.

The head of Ukraine's Centre for Countering Disinformation, Andriy Kovalenko, said that in addition to its own ammunition, Russia had also started to store North Korean munitions in Toropets.

Maxar satellite service collected imagery clearly shows the extent of the damage from the Ukrainian drone attack causing a series of explosions, according to a photo shared by the Russia Team Lead at the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). 

The imagery shows large pillars of smoke covering much of the area, while a closer look at the ammunition storage area indicates that fires continue to burn in and near some bunkers, ISW's George Barros added.

**Have the storage bunkers been destroyed?**
--------------------------------------------

Most of the ammunition is presumably stored underground, so the question is whether Ukraine used any drones that could have penetrated inside the bunkers.

A full damage assessment remains impossible due to the thick smoke above the site. However, the possible destruction of the bunkers might have also been the result of Moscow not respecting its own regulations by placing the bunkers too close together, for example.

While repeatedly calling on the West to lift the restrictions over the use of long-range missiles deep into Russian territory, Ukraine has been using its home-produced UAVs to strike as deep as 1,800 kilometres into Russia, as was the case in the city of Orsk.

 has a workable plan to end the war, now in its third year, although its details have not been publicly disclosed.

Ukraine claimed the strike destroyed military warehouses in Toropets, a town in Russia’s Tver region about 380 kilometers (240 miles) northwest of Moscow and about 500 kilometers (300 miles) from the border with Ukraine.

The attack was carried out by Ukraine’s Security Service, along with Ukraine’s Intelligence and Special Operations Forces, a Kyiv security official told The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the operation.

According to the official, the depot housed Iskander and Tochka-U missiles, as well as glide bombs and artillery shells. Supreme Court](https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court)

 the Main Missile and Artillery Directorate (GRAU) arsenal in Toropets, about 240 miles west of Moscow, at about 3.30 a.m. Bulgakov was arrested earlier this year on corruption charges that he denies.

Tver Oblast Governor Igor Rudenya said on Telegram that a fire had broken out in Toropets caused by falling drone debris but claimed the situation was "under control." He later announced an evacuation of part of the town's population.

Tver was not mentioned in a Russian defense ministry report that 54 drones launched over five regions had been shot down overnight.

*   Massive blasts detected by earthquake monitors
*   NASA picks up multiple heat sources from space
*   Some anger expressed in Russia over the attack

LONDON, Sept 18 (Reuters) - A large-scale Ukrainian drone attack on Russia triggered an earthquake-sized blast at a major arsenal in the Tver region on Wednesday, forcing the evacuation of a nearby town, war bloggers and some media reported.

Unverified video and images on social media showed a huge ball of flame blasting into the night sky and multiple detonations thundering across a lake about 380 km (240 miles) west of Moscow.

NASA satellites picked up intense heat sources emanating from an area of about 14 square kilometres (5 square miles) at the site in the early hours and earthquake monitoring stations noted what sensors thought was a small [earthquake, opens new tab](https://www.volcanodiscovery.com/earthquakes/quake-info/9611698/mag2quake-Sep-18-2024-BALTIC-STATES-BELARUS-NW-RUSSIA-REGION.html#google_vignette)
 in the area.

"The enemy hit an ammunition depot in the area of Toropets," said Yuri Podolyaka, a Ukrainian-born, pro-Russian military blogger. "Everything that can burn is already burning there (and exploding)."

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, speaking in his nightly video address, hailed the outcome of the attack without referring specifically to the target.

"A very important result was achieved last night on Russian territory and such actions weaken the enemy," Zelenskiy said. "I thank everyone involved. Such precision is truly inspiring."

He thanked the SBU security service, the HUR intelligence service and the Special Operations Forces.

A source in Ukraine's SBU state security service had earlier told Reuters the drone attack had destroyed [a warehouse storing missiles](/world/europe/ukraine-destroyed-arsenal-russias-tver-region-kyiv-security-source-says-2024-09-18/)
, guided bombs and artillery ammunition.

Russian state media have in the past reported that a major arsenal for conventional weapons was located at the site of the blasts. State media, now subject to military censorship laws, was muted in its reporting on Wednesday.

Igor Rudenya, governor of the Tver region, said that Ukrainian drones had been shot down, that a fire had broken out and that some residents were being evacuated. He did not say what was burning.

One woman told Reuters that members of her family had been evacuated from Toropets.

"A fire started with explosions," said the woman, who identified herself only as Irina.

Rudenya later said the situation in Toropets was stable as of midday local time (0900 GMT) and that evacuated residents could return. The fire had been put out and there were no recorded fatalities, he said.

Russia and Ukraine each reported dozens of enemy drone attacks on their territory overnight, with Russian forces advancing in eastern [Ukraine](https://www.reuters.com/topic/event/ukraine-crisis/)
.

MAJOR EXPLOSION
---------------

The size of the main blast shown in the unverified social media video was consistent with 200-240 tons of high explosives detonating, said George William Herbert of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey in California.

A Toropets chatroom on the Russian social media site VK was flooded with messages of support from other parts of the country and offers of help to people fleeing the town.

Some people were asking whether buildings at specific addresses were still standing.

"People, does anyone know what's happened to Kudino village??? They told me nothing is left of our house," posted one woman.

Another woman replied: "It's horror there." Kudino is a village 4.5 km (2.8 miles) northeast of Toropets.

Some war bloggers asked how drones could trigger such large blasts at what was thought to be a highly fortified facility.

According to an RIA state news agency report from 2018, Russia was building an arsenal for the storage of missiles, ammunition and explosives in Toropets, a 1,000-year-old town, with a population of just over 11,000.

Dmitry Bulgakov, then a deputy defence minister, told RIA in 2018 that the facility could defend weapons from missiles and even a small nuclear attack. Bulgakov was arrested earlier this year on corruption charges, which he denies.

"It (the concrete facilities) ensures their reliable and safe storage, protects them from air and missile strikes and even from the damaging factors of a nuclear explosion," RIA quoted Bulgakov as saying at the time.

Some Russians on chat groups expressed anger.

"Why wasn't the ammunition underground?! What are you doing???? In Kudino, houses were blown away! Why is the forest burning and no one is there... What kind of negligence is this!!!!" one woman posted.

Russia reported that its air defence units had destroyed 54 drones launched against five Russian regions overnight, without mentioning Tver. Ukraine said it had [shot down 46 of 52 drones](/world/europe/russian-drones-attack-energy-facilities-ukraines-sumy-authorities-say-2024-09-18/)
 launched by Moscow overnight and that Russia had used three guided air missiles which did not reach their targets.

Ukraine’s Drone Raid on Giant Russian Ammo Dump Most Destructive of Russo-Ukrainian War
=======================================================================================

Russian state-controlled media has been saying very little about the massive attack, but satellite images of the aftermath tell a story of sheer devastation.

A Ukrainian kamikaze drone strike hitting a major ammunition storage facility in central Russia on Wednesday was likely the most damaging long-range attack launched by Kyiv in 30 months of combat, and possibly the most devastating air strike ever to hit Russia, World War II included.

Kremlin-controlled information platforms on Thursday were downplaying damage reports and assuring the public that the situation was well under control. But one day after a Ukrainian nighttime air raid against Toropets Northeast Ammunition Depot, in Russia’s Tver region, evidence was pointing to a wildly successful long-range strike by Kyiv against a war-critical piece of Russian military infrastructure.

Following a 2018-2020 renovation of the site, Russian state-controlled media had billed Toropets as the most modern and attack-resistant munitions storage facility in all of the Russian Federation.

Eyewitness recordings of the early morning strike, posted online by local news platforms and social media, contain audio of jet engines passing overhead at tree-top level at five- to ten-second intervals, followed by explosions in the distance. Photographs and videos of almost apocalyptic fires lighting the night horizon and explosions breaking windows even 6 kilometers from the epicenter flooded local chat groups.

Ukraine’s military intelligence agency, HUR, responsible for Ukraine’s long-range bombardment of Russia, first launched jet-powered drones in an Aug. 24 attack against an ammunition depot in Russia’s Voronezh region. Reportedly around 20 aircraft flew in that strike, which set storage bunkers ablaze for hours before firemen could control the fires.

2020 was a festival of solidarity. Today, resistance in Belarus is quiet – but it still exists. Kyiv Post speaks to the sister of a political prisoner still in jail.

Aircraft counts in Ukraine’s operation, hitting the even bigger Toropets depot on Thursday, according to eyewitness estimates, put the raid’s drone count at least 100 aircraft. Some eyewitnesses told local media they heard 10-15 subsequent blasts, orders of magnitude more powerful than explosions from individual drone impacts.

Before (Sept. 8) and after satellite (Sept. 18) overhead images of the Toropets ammunition storage site in Russia, recorded by Maxar and published by the Osint researcher Christopher Miller. In total Toropets contains 95 ammunition bunkers. The upgraded bunkers probably targeted by Kyiv are at the lower left of the images. At least 13 bunkers were reportedly destroyed. The damage might be worse but not visible because of the smoke. Kyiv Post photo collage.

A Wednesday Defense Ministry announcement said air defenses shot down 54 UAVs overnight on all fronts, but did not mention the Tver region or Toropets base. Tver region governor Igor Rudenya in a Wednesday statement said that “falling drone fragments” had set portions of the Toropets facility on fire but that emergency responders were on the scene and that authorities had the situation in hand.

Photographs snapped at ground level and geolocated to viewpoints around the Toropets base showed more than two-thirds the length of the five square kilometer site still blazing violently by midday Thursday. The US-managed NASA satellite network recorded hot spots consistent with major fires engulfing about half the territory of the facility. The satellite group MAXAR published images of smoke distinctly visible from space.

Open-source seismic recordings published on Wednesday and Thursday, among them by the Norwegian seismic monitoring group NORSAR, picked up 13 explosions around Toropets taking place during or in the hours after the Ukrainian attack. Each “seismic event” registered at between 2.0-2.8 magnitude, with energy comparable to a small earthquake, news reports said.

Outlying homes in three villages located a half kilometer or less from the north fence of the facility were damaged, according to news reports. Some local social media reported the village Tsikarevo, less than 300 meters from Toropets’ northeastern security fence, was completely destroyed. The local television news platform RBC-TV reported fires had surrounded and consumed several villages and towns, forcing hundreds of people to flee their homes.

Social media recorded smoke and fires burning throughout the day, and explosions continuing for hours as individual munitions cooked off. Some video showed people identifying themselves as residents of Tsikarevo and stating they had no way to escape the conflagration but by boat via a nearby lake, because explosions at Toropets had flattened nearby forests and made all roads impassable.

Images published by Maxar Intelligence & Space systems on Thursday showed the Ukrainian target planners appeared to have concentrated on the modernized section of the storage base, adjacent to Tsikarevo village, and that reinforced at least 13 ammunition bunkers, as well as unreinforced buildings and barracks, had suffered substantial damage or were destroyed.

Still-burning fires and smoke were limiting satellites’ view of the facility and later confirmation of more damage was possible. Unless the fires were put out, as-yet undamaged bunkers could overheat and explode, military analysts said.

[! <image:4565>](https://static.kyivpost.com/storage/2024/09/19/b58d06c92be8ce9f26d6922da93bc3b0.jpg?w=2560&f=webp)

Map prepared by the “X” user Intelschizo showing west Russia’s main rail lines and likely routes taken by ammunition from the Toropets storage site to fighting formations in Ukraine. The base reportedly supplies Russian troops fighting on all fronts, but most critically in the Kharkiv sector in Ukraine, and the Kursk sector inside Russia.

Local media variously reported death tolls from a low of ten to more than two hundred. Many news reports said victims were mostly service personnel at the base or civilians caught in the initial blasts, or later trapped by fires. The state-run RIA Novosti on Thursday reported 13 people were hospitalized but no one was killed.

Prior to Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, the Toropets site had served as the Russian army’s main European storage site for artillery rockets and missiles. Inventory reportedly included tens of thousands of 122mm artillery rockets, as well as smaller numbers of S-300 and S-400 heavy anti-aircraft missiles, Soviet-era Tochka-U tactical missiles, and the Iskander missile, a modernized nuclear capable weapon currently used by Russia mostly to bombard Ukrainian cities and military targets with conventional warheads.

According to Ukrainian military researchers, logisticians at Toropets supply Russian forces in all sectors but most critically to troops in Russia’s Kursk region and in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region. 

According to unconfirmed reports, stocks of the North Korean KN-23 missile, a ballistic weapon recently delivered by North Korea to Russia in defiance of arms embargoes on Pyongyang, also were in Toropets at the time of the Ukrainian attack. According to pre-war Kremlin statements, base maximum rated capacity was about 30,000 tons of munitions of all types.

The Russian Air Force unofficial spokesman FighterBomber, a former pilot, in a Thursday Telegram entry said that the amount of explosives on hand when the Ukrainian drones nosed in was substantially more than officially allowed because “since the start of the war… no one has paid any attention to safety rules.”

Although it was not clear how much TNT-equivalent detonated all at once at Toropets, by Thursday the scale of destruction following the Ukrainian strike seemed on track to place the blasts there among the largest non-nuclear explosions in history. In 1947, in probably Europe’s biggest single blast ever, British army engineers detonated 6,700 tons of WWII-era ammunition stored on the German North Sea Island Heligoland to dispose of it.

Anastasiya Kashevarova, a war supporter and Kremlin approved milblogger, blamed former Vice Defense Minister Dmitry Bulgakov as culpable for the massive explosions and loss of military materiel and life at Toropets. He is currently in state custody pending graft and corruption charges.

According to Russian government news agency TASS, while serving as the Russian army’s top logistics officer Bulgakov may have participated in large-scale embezzlement schemes delivering low-quality goods and services to the military at inflated prices. He was arrested in July 2024.

Russian news platforms on Thursday in reports on the Toropets attack and its cause frequently profiled video of Bulgakov presiding at the Toropets base opening ceremony in 2018 and declaring the facility one of the world’s most modern, meeting “the highest international standards” and so well-built that its bunkers could hold out against a nuclear blast.

[! <image:4566>](https://static.kyivpost.com/storage/2024/09/19/0216b451c095e199322fb927800cf51d.jpg?w=2560&f=webp)

Former Russian Deputy Defense Minister Dmitry Bulgakov salutes at a public review in an image published by APA news on 24 Sept. 2022. He had been responsible for Russian army logistics and relieved “in connection with transfer to another job”, a TASS statement said. He was detained on suspicion of large-scale corruption in July 2024.

The independent Russian research group Gulagu.net, in a recent investigation, said that state prosecutors have evidence that as much as 30 percent of state funding to renovate the Toropets base, some $16 million, was stolen by army logisticians. Kyiv Post was unable to locate Bulgakov for comment.

Experts told _Newsweek_ that, even if an American PMC were operational in Kursk, it would not equate to Ukraine's raid being conducted under the direction or patronage of the Biden administration, as alleged by the Foreign Ministry.

Helene Olsen, a lecturer in defense studies at King's College London and an expert in the usa of mercenaries and other forms of private contractors in conflict, told _Newsweek_ that it is in the nature of PMCs to "go where the money is."

"While American PMCs traditionally have worked closely with the US Gov and many American PMCs have interests that align with the US Gov, PMCs, irrespective of origin, are ultimately businesses," Olsen said, adding that Russia "would benefit from making up these allegations considering the stigma connected with the private military industry."

According to a release on its website, the ministry expressed its "strong protest" to Holmes "in connection with provocative actions of American reporters who illegally infiltrated Kursk Oblast for propagandist reporting of crimes of Kyiv's regime."

The ministry also claimed to have seen evidence "of the participation of an American \[private military company\] on the side of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the invasion of the territory of the Russian Federation."

According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, however, the involvement of an American PMC in these operations ran "counter to the Biden administration's assertions that it was allegedly not involved in the attack by Ukrainian neo-Nazis on Russia" and that this proved "the United States, as a direct participant in the conflict, is involved in Vladimir Zelensky's malicious plans."

The ministry went on to say that an investigation would be launched into the "American citizens involved in these crimes." It added that those who cross over into Russian territory "automatically become a legitimate military target for the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation."

"Russia has repeatedly stated [NATO](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/nato)

*   Russian Foreign Ministry summons US Charge d'affaires in Moscow Stephanie Holmes to convey strong protest against 'provocative actions of American reporters' and 'participation of the American PMCs'   

**MOSCOW** 

Russia protested on Tuesday that US private military companies (PMCs) are fighting alongside Ukraine in the Kursk region, while reporters from several major American media outlets illegally entered Russian territory to cover the incursion. 

The Russian Foreign Ministry claimed in a statement that soldiers from US private military companies are fighting alongside Ukrainian troops in the Kursk region, and journalists illegally entered Russian territory to cover the incursion.

US Charge d'affaires Stephanie Holmes was summoned to the Foreign Ministry in Moscow to convey strong protest against the "provocative actions of American reporters" and "participation of the American PMCs on the side of Ukraine's armed forces during their invasion" of Russia, it said.

"Such actions are contradicting statements by Joe Biden administration about non-involvement in Ukraine's neo-Nazi attack against Russia, proving with all clarity US involvement as a direct participant of the conflict in (Ukraine's President Volodymyr) Zelenskyy's malicious intentions," the ministry stressed.

The ministry warned that Russian law enforcement will investigate US citizens’ actions and take necessary measures to bring them to justice.

"All foreign 'specialists' and mercenaries illegally crossing the border of our country automatically become a legitimate military target for the armed forces of the Russian Federation," it said.

Kyiv's incursion into the Kursk region began on the night of August 5-6, when Ukrainian forces entered near Sudzha. **Please contact us for subscription options.**](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/p/subscription/1001)

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that Russia protested the alleged presence of American soldiers in the Kursk region in August 2024, with the U.S. denying involvement. The image search results show examples of U.S. flag patches, which are visible in the image provided in the claim.

The claim is partially supported by the evidence. The presence of American flag patches on the uniforms in the image aligns with the claim of American involvement. However, the evidence does not definitively confirm that the individuals in the image are mercenaries or that they were involved in an incursion into the Kursk Oblast.

Additional information is needed to verify the claim fully, such as the identity of the individuals in the image and their specific activities in the Kursk region.

 в Харьковской области российские оккупанты потеряли очень много живой силы и техники.

Подробности феерического отступления россиян появляются в сети.

Украинский журналист Денис Казанский [опубликовал](https://t.me/kazansky2017/3989)
 красноречивое фото, на котором два бойца ВСУ "селфятся" на фоне лежащего на земле "орка".

"_Теперь уже можно! Балаклея - это Украина!_", - подписан кадр.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:24> This image shows American mercenaries participating in Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024."

## Actions

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Newsweek reports that Russia protested the alleged presence of American soldiers in the Kursk region, claiming they are involved in Ukraine's incursion into Russian territory. The U.S. has denied involvement. This article was published on August 20, 2024. ([https://www.newsweek.com/russia-protests-american-soldiers-kursk-1942273](https://www.newsweek.com/russia-protests-american-soldiers-kursk-1942273))

Anadolu Agency, published on August 20, 2024, reports that Russia protested the participation of US private military companies (PMCs) fighting alongside Ukraine in the Kursk region. ([https://www.aa.com.tr/en/russia-ukraine-war/russia-formally-protests-us-mercenaries-joining-ukrainian-soldiers-in-kursk-region-/3308755](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/russia-ukraine-war/russia-formally-protests-us-mercenaries-joining-ukrainian-soldiers-in-kursk-region-/3308755)) A website about Ukrainian photographers contains news stories from January 2025. ([https://www.ukrainianphotographers.com/en/news-articles/foreign-mercenaries-in-the-kursk-region](https://www.ukrainianphotographers.com/en/news-articles/foreign-mercenaries-in-the-kursk-region))
<image:3404>, <image:3401>, <image:3403>, <image:1>


### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include images of U.S. flag patches. One source, from [starsnstripesco.com](https://starsnstripesco.com/products/copy-of-u-s-army-regulation-flag-patch-ocp?srsltid=AfmBOopc222egXRzsueUJYYrLIG9z4Cye0uR3e_ovnLIjk-SWrjTYPdb), shows a U.S. flag patch <image:8818>.

Another source, from [propper.com](https://www.propper.com/usa-flag-reverse-patch.html?srsltid=AfmBOoodi2eBnTHkrQ-8Wre7x0lPv7ZlQETVFpxqk6fXFP9rsmwdAin8), shows a military uniform with an American flag patch <image:8819>. A third source, from [asatechmed.com](https://www.asatechmed.com/products/6-pc-assorted-usa-tactical-american-flag-patch-100-embroidered-thin-blue-line-united-states-military-morale-patches-set-for-molle-hats-backpacks-tactical-vest-uniforms?srsltid=AfmBOop5F0TNGVoiOShv4sY6Y4jSUPZvCpKRJRhlYDJQVx96wIeTvf_y), also shows an American flag patch on a military uniform <image:8820>.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Russia protested the alleged presence of American soldiers in the Kursk region in August 2024, with the U.S. denying involvement. The image search results show examples of U.S. flag patches, which are visible in the image provided in the claim.

The claim is partially supported by the evidence. The presence of American flag patches on the uniforms in the image aligns with the claim of American involvement. However, the evidence does not definitively confirm that the individuals in the image are mercenaries or that they were involved in an incursion into the Kursk Oblast.

Additional information is needed to verify the claim fully, such as the identity of the individuals in the image and their specific activities in the Kursk region.

!Оккупанты понесли огромные потери при паническом бегстве из Балаклеи <image:2752>

Многие российские военные попали в засаду.

При бегстве из Балаклеи в Харьковской области российские оккупанты потеряли очень много живой силы и техники.

Подробности феерического отступления россиян появляются в сети, сообщает [«Апостроф»](https://apostrophe.ua/news/society/2022-09-08/rasplata-za-ilovaysk-okkupantyi-ponesli-ogromnyie-poteri-pri-begstve-iz-balaklei-video/278880/)

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Newsweek reports that Russia protested the alleged presence of American soldiers in the Kursk region, claiming they are involved in Ukraine's incursion into Russian territory. The U.S. has denied involvement. This article was published on August 20, 2024. ([https://www.newsweek.com/russia-protests-american-soldiers-kursk-1942273](https://www.newsweek.com/russia-protests-american-soldiers-kursk-1942273))

Anadolu Agency, published on August 20, 2024, reports that Russia protested the participation of US private military companies (PMCs) fighting alongside Ukraine in the Kursk region.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Russia protested the alleged presence of American soldiers in the Kursk region in August 2024, with the U.S. denying involvement. The image search results show examples of U.S. flag patches, which are visible in the image provided in the claim.

The claim is partially supported by the evidence. The presence of American flag patches on the uniforms in the image aligns with the claim of American involvement. However, the evidence does not definitively confirm that the individuals in the image are mercenaries or that they were involved in an incursion into the Kursk Oblast.

Additional information is needed to verify the claim fully, such as the identity of the individuals in the image and their specific activities in the Kursk region.

Российские войска отступают. Как развивается украинское контрнаступление и чем успехи ВСУ последних недель грозят России — мнение экспертов и российских военных

Украина [объявила](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1018539645523163)
 о контрнаступлении на юге страны в Херсонской области 29 августа, а 6 сентября начала наступательную операцию на востоке — в Харьковской области. За это время украинская армия освободила десятки населенных пунктов и продвинулась вглубь российских оборонительных позиций. Поступают сообщения о том, что российские войска отступают из стратегически важных городов — Балаклеи, Купянска, Изюма, Волчанска и Лимана.

### **Российские войска не могут держать оборону и бегут**

«8 лет говорили что и когда будут делать: один треп, обо всем со всех щелей. Никакой тактики, никакого профессионализма, никакого ума. Когда на это \[контрнаступление ВСУ\] смотрим мы \[военные\], мы понимаем, что изначально все было сделано неправильно. Но забили на это хуй, начали двигаться дальше криво, коряво. А с другой \[украинской\] стороны, люди просто взяли, увидели это, соорганизовались, все сделали. ‎

Поэтому в плане войны все выглядит очень логично: мы начали как долбоебы, не смогли ничего удержать, всё разъебали, один сплошной пиздеж вокруг, командования ноль, обеспечения ноль, руководства ноль. И вот изначально было понятно, что будет заканчиваться тем, что нас просто разнесут», — комментирует «‎Важным историям»‎ ситуацию на фронте бывший российский военнослужащий, который участвовал в войне в Украине. «Вспоминаю, как долго \[ВС РФ\] ковыряли Мариуполь и Северодонецк, а тут два дня \[понадобилось ВСУ\]. \[При том, что\] Изюм чуть ли не с первых дней войны был под контролем \[российских войск\], то есть они даже не планировали и не думали, что его, возможно, придется оборонять», — недоумевает другой бывший российский военный.

При этом, в [брифинге](https://t.me/mod_russia/19716)
 российского Минобороны от 10 сентября не было сказано ни слова об оставленных российскими войсками городах. Позже Минобороны [объяснило](https://t.me/mod_russia/19719)
 отступление российских войск «операцией по свертыванию и переброске Изюмско-Балаклейской группировки» для наращивания усилий по «освобождению Донбасса».

«Сейчас мы видим, как российские войска бегут, потому что не могут держать оборону», — описывает происходящее украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. Этому предшествовал первый крупный успех ВСУ в Харьковской области — освобождение 8 сентября города Балаклея, который был оккупирован с марта. «Это место, где сосредоточены склады с боеприпасами для артиллерии, поэтому \[ее освобождение\] достаточно серьезно усилит огневые возможности ВСУ», — говорит военный эксперт.

Именно освобождение Балаклеи позволило ВСУ лишить российскую группировку, которая там сконцентрирована, возможности держать оборону, поскольку отрезало их от «логистической артерии» Волчанск-Большой Бурлук-Купянск-Изюм, по которой происходило снабжение армии, объясняет эксперт. «Без снабжения вся эта масса личного состава и техники, сконцентрированная на Изюмском направлении, оказалась бы не боеспособной», — говорит Коваленко.

По словам российского военного эксперта Юрия Федорова, у российских войск на этом направлении «очень крупные потери»: не только убитыми, но и пленными: «как минимум сотни пленных, если не пара тысяч».

Вероятное большое количество пленных подтверждают и двое бывших военнослужащих российской армии. «При спонтанном отступлении особенно много пленных. Связи внутри подразделений нет. Кто где находится, командиры не всегда знают. Соответственно, об отступлении не все могут знать», — говорят они. Бывший военнослужащий одного из элитных подразделений в разговоре с «Важными историями» отметил, что на Харьковском направлении обе стороны несут ощутимые потери. «Когда мои говорят: „Бля, там пиздец“, значит, что всё плохо», — добавил собеседник «Важных историй».

### **Почему провалилась российская оборона**

Несмотря на то, что в Харьковской области было сконцентрировано больше российских войск, чем задействовано сил ВСУ в контрнаступлении на этом участке, операция была направлена на особо уязвимые места, где возможности российских подразделений по обороне были истощены, говорит украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. «Российское командование знало, что у них есть уязвимые места в Харьковской области, они даже пытались их в значительной степени усилить. Знали, но предотвратить \[исход событий\] не могли: нехватка ресурсов уже начала сказываться на их возможностях по ведению обороны. И сейчас мы наблюдаем каскадный обвал обороны», — объясняет Александр Коваленко.

*   [ЗСУ вже на околицях окупованого Куп’янська](https://cripo.com.ua/news/war/zsu-vzhe-na-okolytsyah-okupovanogo-kup-yanska/ "Permalink to ЗСУ вже на околицях окупованого Куп’янська")
    

Российский военный эксперт Юрий Федоров говорит, что в Харьковской области украинская армия использовала новую тактику, которая и обеспечила успех на этом направлении. «ВСУ действуют очень динамично и фактически не задерживаются на то, чтобы штурмовать те или иные города. Они просто их обходят, берут в кольцо, и тогда гарнизоны этих городков и небольших сел просто вынуждены капитулировать, — рассказывает российский военный эксперт Юрий Федоров.

— Сейчас уже практически взят Купянск, по крайней мере, та часть, которая находится на правом берегу. Сдан Изюм или находится в процессе. Российские войска уходят оттуда, чтобы не попасть в окружение. Это, в общем, разумное решение, потому что коммуникации перерезаны. Сам по себе Изюм находится на стыке двух рек: Оскол и Северский Донец. Если его окружить, скажем, с северо-востока или с севера, то он просто будет отрезан от подвоза боеприпасов и всего прочего, и \[российская армия\] вынуждена будет капитулировать. Чтобы этого не случилось, они просто выводят войска, пока есть возможность».

Юрий Федоров считает, что ВСУ тактически и оперативно переиграли российские войска, которым не хватило ресурсов для сдерживания этого наступления. «\[Сначала\] была прорвана оборона в районе Балаклеи. А затем российские войска были разбросаны гарнизонами по различным городкам, селам. Эти гарнизоны часто состояли из Росгвардии, а также мобилизованных из так называемых народных республик.

Росгвардия в принципе воевать не умеет, она не для этого предназначена. Задача этих гарнизонов и гвардейских полков заключалась в том, чтобы держать в подчинении местное население. А среди мобилизованных многие в первый раз взяли в руки автомат, надели каску, мотивации \[у них нет\] никакой. Российские регулярные части были отведены частично на правобережье в Херсонскую область, частично на Донецкое направление, где они пытались штурмовать пригород Донецка, занятый ВСУ. Поэтому вот такой разгром», — объясняет военный эксперт.

Это же подтверждает в разговоре с «Важными историями» и российский военнослужащий, который был на этом направлении. «\[Подведомственные\] Минобороны \[войска\], группировка Восток, вышли с этого направления еще в июле в Белгородскую область. На тот момент в Изюме я встречал БАРСов (_боевой армейский резерв страны_ — **Прим. ред.**), ополченцев и войска ПВО Западного округа. После \[их\] выхода в Изюм зашёл СОБР и ОМОН. Соответственно, там действительно остались только „БАРСики“, ополченцы и Росгвардия», — говорит он.

По словам эксперта Федорова, российское командование просчиталось в оценке ситуации, когда перебросило боевые части с юга Харьковской области на другие направления до начала контрнаступления. «Считалось, что в районе расположения изюмской группировки ничего страшного случиться не может. Просчет заключался в том, что не была оценена вероятность того, что украинские войска начнут там наступление», — говорит Федоров.

«Российское командование с профессиональной точки зрения оценивают как очень слабое. Это люди, которые умеют бросать в бой значительное количество живой силы, но отсутствует инициатива в исполнении приказа. Написано „занять такой-то перекресток“, а может быть, лучше занять другой перекресток рядышком, но это недопустимая вещь, \[только\] тупое упорное выполнение приказа», — добавляет он.

«Нельзя, чтобы армия, которая строилась двадцать лет, сегодня такая: все, мы будем работать по-другому. Нас заставляли быть тупыми и не принимать никаких решений, — подтверждает бывший военнослужащий российской армии. — Попробуй сержанту скажи, что ты считаешь, что лучше вот так вот. Тебе ебало просто сломают, если не застрелят сразу. И так на всех уровнях. Верховный главнокомандующий принимает только „‎правильные“‎ решения — а все остальные должны их исполнять. И если что, они будут нести наказание, не потому что сверху долбоебы, а потому что „‎вы плохо \[приказы\] исполняете, вы не исполнительные“»‎, — говорит он.

![Український контрнаступ та звільнення міста Балаклія Харківської області та навколишніх сіл](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201280%20960'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

«Самые успешные операции за всю мою службу были те, о которых знали только мы. Только те люди, которые в ней участвуют. Потому что стоит таким заняться командованию… Поэтому когда мы сами решали, что делать, не ожидая команды сверху или пока качнут связь, чтобы уточнить, связаться, запросить разрешение на выполнение, уточнение и прочую херню, мы всегда все выполняли на 100 %», — отмечает бывший военнослужащий одного из элитных подразделений ВС РФ.

Накануне, 9 сентября, Минобороны [показало](https://t.me/mod_russia/19710)
 кадры переброски военной техники в Харьковскую область, но это подкрепление не помогло отстоять города. «Этих подкреплений крайне недостаточно, — говорит Юрий Федоров. — Даже вертолетами перебрасывали личный состав и легкую технику. Но это все равно, что пытаться из пипетки наполнить стакан, практически бессмысленная задача».

Александр Коваленко объясняет это тем, что переброска поддержки была лишь пропагандистским жестом. «Российской армии срочно понадобилось демонстрировать некую активность, что „помощь близка“, „мы своих не бросаем“, якобы они готовы оказывать поддержку тем подразделениям, которые оказались в сложной ситуации. Но эта переброска имела неорганизованный, хаотический характер, она не могла обеспечить никакой поддержки», — говорит эксперт.

По его словам, те подразделения, которые зашли в зону боевых действий для поддержки, были обречены. Многие из них давным-давно требовали ротации или вывода для восстановления боеспособности из-за понесенных до этого серьезных потерь. «В ближайшее время мы будем узнавать о большом количестве подразделений российской армии, которые попросту перестали существовать, поскольку вместо вывода на восстановление боеспособности их кинули в самую мясорубку, самое жерло боевых столкновений», — говорит он.

### **Чем российской армии грозит прорыв ВСУ**

Освобождение Купянска и Изюма важно в стратегическом смысле тем, что оно отрезает российские группировки от путей снабжения и открывает ВСУ путь на Луганское и Донецкое направление, говорит украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. «Эти города важны тем, что они являются неотъемлемой частью логистических артерий поставок техники, материально-технического обеспечения, боеприпасов, личного состава как в Харьковскую область, так и в целом на донбасский плацдарм. Купянск является очень важным логистическим узлом, сердцем этой артерии.

Через него шло обеспечение города Изюм, который стал центром сосредоточения самой большой бронетанковой группы российских оккупантов за все время полномасштабного вторжения в Украину, — говорит эксперт. — И вся эта масса должна была идти в сторону Славянска и Краматорска. Сейчас планы по захвату Славянска и Краматорска можно считать аннулированными. Потеря \[российской армией\] таких населенных пунктов как Купянск и Изюм полностью рушит систему обеспечения донбасского плацдарма и позволяет ВСУ в дальнейшем развивать контрнаступательные действия уже не только в Харьковской области, но и в Луганском и Донецком направлениях».

В ближайшие дни можно ожидать, что Харьковская область будет освобождена, уверен российский военный эксперт Юрий Федоров. «Это не решающее сражение, но очень крупный успех ВСУ», — говорит он. По его словам, тогда вооруженные силы Украины смогут перебросить значительное количество личного состава и на другие направления.

Херсонская область
------------------

### **Российской армии не хватает сил для обороны**

Еще одно не менее важное направление, на котором продолжают наступать силы ВСУ, — контролируемый российскими войсками плацдарм на правом берегу Днепра в Херсонской области. Украинское контрнаступление началось там 29 августа. В тот день, по [данным](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1018539645523163)
 оперативной группировки ВСУ «Каховка», ей удалось «прорвать первую линию обороны» в Херсонской области. «109 полк „ДНР“ отошел со своих позиций, российские десантники, которые были их поддержкой, сбежали с поля боя», — [говорилось](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1018539645523163)
 в сообщении. 4 сентября ВСУ [установили](https://www.facebook.com/kirill.timoshenko/posts/5588117717898633)
 украинский флаг в крупном населенном пункте Высокополье.

Точная численность российской группировки, которая находится на правом берегу Днепра, где Украина ведет контрнаступление, неизвестна. По разным оценкам, на начало контрнаступления там находилось от [20](https://www.currenttime.tv/a/ukraine-russia-war-kherson/31989285.html)
 до [25 тысяч](https://www.currenttime.tv/a/32011307.html)
 российских военных. Нет точных данных и о численности украинской группировки. Источник «Важных историй» из числа бывших сотрудников российской спецслужбы, пожелавший остаться анонимным, говорит, что для контрнаступления в Херсонской области Украина сформировала «довольно скромные резервы»: их численность — 10–12 тысяч человек.

Однако, по его словам, у Украины есть еще резервы, не брошенные в контрнаступление, которые не должны позволить российской стороне замкнуть окружение вокруг прорвавшихся вперед войск. Максимальную оценку украинских сил на этом фронте [приводит](https://www.currenttime.tv/a/rf-boitsya-poteryat-litso-i-poetomu-otdaet-svoih-soldat-na-myaso-na-pravom-beregu-dnepra-eksperty-o-rasklade-sil-na-yuge-ukrainy-/32011763.html)
 украинский военный эксперт Роман Свитан: по его данным, там находится 30 тысяч бойцов ВСУ.

![Зеленым цветом обозначены освобожденные территории, красным — оккупированные территории Источник: Украинский проект deepstatemap. Последнее обновление: 10 сентября, 18:23](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%20703'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

«Теми силами, которые присутствуют сейчас на правом берегу Днепра, российская армия в среднесрочной перспективе не сможет удерживать контрнаступление ВСУ», — уверен украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. По словам аналитика Conflict Intelligence Team (CIT) Кирилла Михайлова, ВСУ удалось создать определенное превосходство в численности личного состава на основных направлениях наступления в Херсонской области. «К этому добавляется эффективная работа артиллерии и локальное превосходство Украины в воздухе, которое позволяет использовать как фронтовую авиацию, так и ударные беспилотники», — комментирует он расстановку сил.

По его словам, сейчас украинцы наступают в Херсонской области как минимум на трех направлениях: с запада; северо-запада, где они расширяют плацдарм на оккупированном \[Россией\] берегу реки Ингулец; и с севера, где им удалось взять крупный населенный пункт Высокополье и «затрофеить» большое количество военной техники российского десанта. На сегодня украинской армии удалось продвинуться на территорию более десяти населенных пунктов в Херсонской области, говорит Михайлов. «Хоть эти населенные пункты и небольшие, они являются оборонительными узлами. Пока мы видим преимущество на украинской стороне», — говорит он.

Нехватку ресурсов у российской группировки на этом направлении подтверждает и бывший сотрудник российской спецслужбы. «Из-за нехватки солдат и офицеров российские войска на фронте сосредоточены в недостаточном количестве. Людей примерно в три раза меньше, чем нужно для выполнения поставленных задач: требуется минимум одна батальонно-тактическая группа на 3 километра, а у России — одна на 5 километров. Такой численностью не наступают, это похоже на авантюру, — говорит он. — Прорвав первую линию \[обороны\] российских войск, украинское наступление должно было упереться во вторую линию, но проблема в том, что у российской военной группировки ее нет: из-за нехватки людей такие прорывы затыкают лишь мобильными резервами. И это может сделать ситуацию непредсказуемой».

Достоверных данных о потерях обеих сторон в этой схватке сейчас нет, говорит аналитик CIT Кирилл Михайлов, но судя по [публикации](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/09/04/ukraine-is-losing-fewer-soldiers-in-its-counter-offensive-than-russia-claims)
 The Economist (журналисты побывали в прифронтовом городе Николаеве, поговорили с местными врачами и не увидели там «переполненных моргов» с погибшими украинскими военными, о чем утверждает российская сторона), хоть потери украинской армии выросли с началом наступления, они не катастрофические, как это заявляет российское Минобороны. По словам бывшего сотрудника российской спецслужбы, с которым поговорили «Важные истории», потери украинской стороны высоки, потому что наступающая сторона всегда теряет больше обороняющейся.

На третий день контрнаступления в Херсонской области The Wall Street Journal [поговорила](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ukrainian-soldiers-say-they-are-advancing-in-the-south-but-at-a-cost-11661983338)
 в госпитале с ранеными украинскими солдатами, которые участвовали в операции. По их словам, бои на пути к Херсону идут крайне ожесточенные, но украинские войска продвигаются вперед. «У них много техники, но мало людей», — сказал один из украинских военных. Кроме этого, они утверждают, что некоторые российские солдаты бегут со своих позиций, бросая технику и устанавливая мины на телах погибших товарищей.

По словам одного из российских военнослужащих, который сейчас находится в Херсонской области, российская армия там находится в тяжелом положении, солдаты массово пытаются уволиться. «Две недели назад командиры нам сказали, что на нас наступление идет. А нам даже боеприпасы никак не привезти, потому что дамба разбита (_вероятно, речь идет о дамбе в Новой Каховке_ — **Прим. ред.**). Люди каждый день ходят с рапортами \[на увольнение\], но почти всем их разрывают», — написал он. Спустя две недели военный передал «Важным историям», что при обстреле чудом выжил, и «там все жестко».

Другой источник, близкий к российским военнослужащим, которые находятся на Херсонском направлении, передал, что солдаты в полном шоке, «никто ничего не понимает, гибнут пачками, потери ужасные. Некоторые вообще звонят, прощаются, мы, говорят, смертники ебучие».

### **У российской армии проблемы со снабжением**

Еще одна проблема российской группировки, которая должна сдерживать прорыв украинской армии в Херсонской области, заключается в том, что она оказалась отрезанной от всех основных путей снабжения. Ранее снабжение российской группировки на правом берегу Днепра происходило через мосты, по которым везли боеприпасы, технику, топливо и продовольствие с левого берега реки. Однако в результате ударов ВСУ все стационарные мосты через Днепр были выведены из строя, понтонные и паромные переправы постоянно подвергаются обстрелам.

«\[Исход этого противостояния на правом берегу Днепра\] зависит от того, удастся ли россиянам организовать поставки \[снабжения\] паромами, поскольку все постоянные мосты перестали функционировать. Наладить понтонные переправы через Днепр \[российской армии\] не удалось. Сейчас функционирует несколько паромных переправ — их украинцам тяжелее поражать, чем мосты, потому что паромы мобильны, сложно предугадать, где они находятся.

Однако периодически украинцы пытаются поражать скопление российской техники в местах ожидания паромов. Это должно вызывать значительные проблемы со снабжением. Насколько россиянам хватит ресурсов для противостояния, зависит от того, смогут ли они эффективно перебрасывать подкрепление, а также от того, сколько продержатся силы ВДВ, пока у них не закончится техника, которая не отличается бронированностью», — говорит аналитик CIT Кирилл Михайлов.

### **Чем России грозит продвижение ВСУ** 

Освобождение украинскими войсками населенного пункта Высокополье в Херсонской области 4 сентября сделало невозможным для российской армии ведение наступательных действий в направлении Кривого Рога в Днепропетровской области, говорит украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. «Это была крайняя северная точка, откуда россияне могли развернуть наступательную операцию в Криворожском направлении. В настоящее время эти возможности у них отсутствуют, — объясняет он.

— Кроме того, благодаря Высокополью ВСУ получили возможность расширить плацдарм в правобережной части Херсонской области и сформировать условия для контрнаступления на достаточно угрожающем участке для многих подразделений ВС РФ. Если ВСУ будут достаточно успешно развивать наступательные действия, то мы сможем говорить о том, что огромное количество российских подразделений может оказаться фактически в окружении».

Стратегический и политический смысл операции на Херсонском направлении для Украины в том, чтобы разгромить российскую группировку на правом берегу Днепра и освободить Херсон, считает аналитик CIT Кирилл Михайлов. «Это позволит задействовать экономические ресурсы области, а также продемонстрировать западным партнерам Украины \[поставщикам оружия\], что страна в состоянии наступать и выигрывать — нужно только больше \[поставок\] оружия.

Кроме этого, в долгосрочной перспективе ликвидация правобережного плацдарма устраняет перспективу наступления \[российской армии\] на Николаев, Кривой Рог и Одессу, потому что именно захват мостов и выход на правый берег Днепра был самым значительным успехом россиян на первом этапе операции. Ликвидация этого плацдарма сильно снижает угрозу всей правобережной Украине, в том числе западному Черноморью, которое критически важно для Украины с точки зрения, например, экспорта сельхозпродукции», — объясняет эксперт значимость операции на этом направлении.

Где еще наступают ВСУ и какая битва будет решающей
--------------------------------------------------

Кроме Херсонской и Харьковской областей, ВСУ осуществляют наступательные действия в Донецкой области, говорит украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. В частности освобожден населенный пункт Озерное в Донецкой области. «Аналогичные новости будут поступать и из Луганской области, где значительно активизировались ВСУ, воспользовавшись ослаблением российских подразделений после достаточно продолжительного воздействия на них огневым потенциалом», — уверен эксперт.

По мнению Коваленко, решающей для этой войны битвой станет контрнаступление украинской армии в Запорожской области. «Битва за правобережную Херсонщину — это очень важный промежуточный этап. После ее завершения и освобождения Херсона будет освобождена и значительная часть ресурсов ВСУ, которые были задействованы для сдерживания российских оккупантов и для ведения этой контрнаступательной операции. И эти ресурсы могут быть использованы на других направлениях: Запорожской, Харьковской, Донецкой и Луганской областях.

Они сыграют решающую роль в значительном ускорении, увеличении активности и интенсивности действий ВСУ. Для командования российских войск очень важно сохранять контроль именно над Запорожской областью. Ее потеря для россиян — это фактически выстрел в висок, поскольку это станет потерей всего юга, а потеря всего юга — это и потеря Крыма. Выйдя в Запорожскую область, ВСУ получат возможность блокировать Крым с материковой части Украины и нанести удары по Керченскому мосту — то есть отрезать его от материковой части России и начать операцию по освобождению Крыма», — говорит он.

«Что война проиграна, можно было легко судить, когда не получилось взять Киев. Плюс сейчас начинается слякоть, холода, потом зима. И такие простые вещи как теплая одежда, нормальная обувь и место для ночлега, будут влиять как на на здоровье, так и на отношение людей на фронте к войне, — говорит бывший российский военный. — Это трагичный конец, которого мы и ожидали. Война работает в обе стороны: за что боролись, на то и напоролись. В наше руководство я не верю, конечно. Как родина нас кидает, мы и так знаем. Уже кинула, начиная с 14-го \[года\] — заканчивая сегодня. Сами это дерьмо устроили, естественно, мы охуеть как насосемся теперь. Проблема в том, что мы изначально на проигравшей и некомпетентной стороне были. Родина сначала кинула мясом, а теперь бросила умирать. И у этого нет ни цели, ни мотива, никакой пользы никому — ни единому человеку».

Newsweek reports that Russia protested the alleged presence of American soldiers in the Kursk region, claiming they are involved in Ukraine's incursion into Russian territory. The U.S. has denied involvement. This article was published on August 20, 2024. ([https://www.newsweek.com/russia-protests-american-soldiers-kursk-1942273](https://www.newsweek.com/russia-protests-american-soldiers-kursk-1942273))

Anadolu Agency, published on August 20, 2024, reports that Russia protested the participation of US private military companies (PMCs) fighting alongside Ukraine in the Kursk region. ([https://www.aa.com.tr/en/russia-ukraine-war/russia-formally-protests-us-mercenaries-joining-ukrainian-soldiers-in-kursk-region-/3308755](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/russia-ukraine-war/russia-formally-protests-us-mercenaries-joining-ukrainian-soldiers-in-kursk-region-/3308755)) A website about Ukrainian photographers contains news stories from January 2025.

### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include images of U.S. flag patches. One source, from [starsnstripesco.com](https://starsnstripesco.com/products/copy-of-u-s-army-regulation-flag-patch-ocp?srsltid=AfmBOopc222egXRzsueUJYYrLIG9z4Cye0uR3e_ovnLIjk-SWrjTYPdb), shows a U.S. flag patch <image:8818>.

Another source, from [propper.com](https://www.propper.com/usa-flag-reverse-patch.html?srsltid=AfmBOoodi2eBnTHkrQ-8Wre7x0lPv7ZlQETVFpxqk6fXFP9rsmwdAin8), shows a military uniform with an American flag patch <image:8819>. A third source, from [asatechmed.com](https://www.asatechmed.com/products/6-pc-assorted-usa-tactical-american-flag-patch-100-embroidered-thin-blue-line-united-states-military-morale-patches-set-for-molle-hats-backpacks-tactical-vest-uniforms?srsltid=AfmBOop5F0TNGVoiOShv4sY6Y4jSUPZvCpKRJRhlYDJQVx96wIeTvf_y), also shows an American flag patch on a military uniform <image:8820>.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Russia protested the alleged presence of American soldiers in the Kursk region in August 2024, with the U.S. denying involvement. The image search results show examples of U.S. flag patches, which are visible in the image provided in the claim.

The claim is partially supported by the evidence. The presence of American flag patches on the uniforms in the image aligns with the claim of American involvement. However, the evidence does not definitively confirm that the individuals in the image are mercenaries or that they were involved in an incursion into the Kursk Oblast.

Additional information is needed to verify the claim fully, such as the identity of the individuals in the image and their specific activities in the Kursk region.


## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:24>)
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image in the claim (<image:24>) appears in articles from September 2022, not August 2024, about the Ukrainian army's victory in Balakleya. The articles, published on websites like Apostrophe.ua and charter97.org, describe the image as showing Ukrainian soldiers with a dead Russian soldier. The image was taken by Ukrainian journalist Denis Kazansky.


## Elaboration
The reverse image search reveals that the image predates August 2024 and was taken in September 2022, not August 2024. The image depicts Ukrainian soldiers, not American mercenaries, and the location is Balakleya, not Kursk Oblast.

The claim is therefore false.


## Final Judgement
The image is from September 2022 and shows Ukrainian soldiers in Balakleya, not American mercenaries in Kursk Oblast in August 2024. The claim is therefore not factually accurate. `false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is false. The image, which shows soldiers with American flag patches, was taken in September 2022 and depicts Ukrainian soldiers in Balakleya, not American mercenaries in the Kursk Oblast in August 2024, as indicated by a reverse image search ([https://apostrophe.ua/news/society/accidents/2022-09-11/v-seti-poyavilos-foto-s-ubityim-rossiyskim-voennym-v-balaklee-kak-na-nego-reagirovali-v-ukraine/280977](https://apostrophe.ua/news/society/accidents/2022-09-11/v-seti-poyavilos-foto-s-ubityim-rossiyskim-voennym-v-balaklee-kak-na-nego-reagirovali-v-ukraine/280977)).

Poland showcases its growing army on a holiday that celebrates its historic defeat of the Red Army

**Armed Forces Day**, known also as the **Feast of the Polish Armed Forces** ([Polish](/wiki/Polish_language "Polish language")
: _Święto Wojska Polskiego_), is a national holiday celebrated annually on 15 August in Poland, commemorating the anniversary of the 1920 victory over [Soviet Russia](/wiki/Russian_Soviet_Federative_Socialist_Republic "Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic")
 at the [Battle of Warsaw](/wiki/Battle_of_Warsaw_(1920) "Battle of Warsaw (1920)")
 during the [Polish–Soviet War](/wiki/Polish%E2%80%93Soviet_War "Polish–Soviet War")
.[\[1\]](#cite_note-PolskieRadio2013-1)
 Armed Forces Day is held in conjunction with the [Day of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary](/wiki/Assumption_of_Mary "Assumption of Mary")
, itself a separate public holiday.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Kontakt24-2)
 The event is marked by [military parades](/wiki/Military_parade "Military parade")
, equipment reviews, showcases and remembrances by all branches of the [Polish Armed Forces](/wiki/Polish_Armed_Forces "Polish Armed Forces")
 across the country. To commemorate the republic's victory over the Red Army, Minister of Military Affairs [Stanisław Szeptycki](/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Szeptycki "Stanisław Szeptycki")
 established the Feast of the Soldier (_Święta Żołnierza_), or Soldiers Day, in 1923.[\[4\]](#cite_note-4)
 In proclaiming the holiday, Szeptycki declared that, "\[o\]n the anniversary of the memorable defeat of the Bolshevik onslaught on Warsaw, we honor the memory of those killed in battles with enemies throughout all ages and for Polish independence."[\[5\]](#cite_note-Museum-5)
 The date of 15 August was chosen as it coincided with the [21st Mountain Division's](/wiki/21st_Mountain_Infantry_Division_(Poland) "21st Mountain Infantry Division (Poland)")
 evening counterattack on Russian troops, eventually forcing the Red Army's general retreat.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Kontakt24-2)
 Additionally, the government of the Second Republic desired the military's greater integration with the new state, as well as for the armed forces to improve its image among the civilian public.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Kontakt24-2)

The Feast of the Soldier remained a celebrated holiday until 1947, when the newly installed communist government of the [People's Republic of Poland](/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_Poland "People's Republic of Poland")
 discontinued the tradition.[\[6\]](#cite_note-Gazeta2013-6)

 units at the [Battle of Lenino](/wiki/Battle_of_Lenino "Battle of Lenino")
 in October 1943.[\[7\]](#cite_note-DzU1950-7)
 The communist government found it impossible to celebrate the original date of 15 August and its coinciding historical significance, owing to its glorification of the [Red Army](/wiki/Red_Army "Red Army")
's defeat.[\[8\]](#cite_note-PolskieRadio2012-8)
 Following the return of democracy in the wake of the [events of 1989](/wiki/Revolutions_of_1989 "Revolutions of 1989")
, the [Sejm](/wiki/Sejm "Sejm")
 approved the restoration of Armed Forces Day to the original 15 August date and meaning on 30 July 1992, repealing the earlier communist era 1950 declaration.[\[9\]](#cite_note-Sejm1992-9)

This year’s parade on August 15 will be an expression of "strength, agency and unity" in the face of "threats from the East," Defence Minister Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz has said.

Speaking during a rehearsal ahead of the Armed Forces Day parade in Warsaw, Kosiniak-Kamysz encouraged the public to celebrate the anniversary of Poland's "great victory" over the Russian Bolsheviks at the 1920 Battle of Warsaw.

"Our presence will be an expression of gratitude to past generations and hope for future ones," he said.

"It will also show our strength, agency and unity in the face of threats from the East," he added.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that Poland held a military parade on August 15, 2024, as part of Armed Forces Day celebrations. The parade showcased various military hardware, including tanks. The parade was part of a four-day celebration from August 14 to 17.

The claim that the image shows a military parade on August 14, 2024, is partially correct, as the celebrations started on that day. However, the main parade took place on August 15, 2024.

The evidence does not explicitly state that the parade was a preparation for war with Russia, although it does mention the event was an expression of strength in the face of threats from the East. Therefore, the claim's assertion about preparing for war is not directly supported by the evidence.
