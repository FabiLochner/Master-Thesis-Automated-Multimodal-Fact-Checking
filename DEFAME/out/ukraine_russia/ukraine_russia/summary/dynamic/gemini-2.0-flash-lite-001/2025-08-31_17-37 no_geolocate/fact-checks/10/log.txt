Useful result: From [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2024/7/8/photos-dozens-killed-as-russia-bombs-ukraine-childrens-hospital-targeted): 
Content: Al Jazeera published an article on July 8, 2024, reporting on Russian missile attacks across Ukraine, including Kyiv. The article mentions a strike on Okhmatdyt National Children’s Specialised Hospital, with dozens killed and wounded. The article includes several images of the aftermath of the attack, showing damage to buildings and rescue efforts. The article does not mention anything about photoshopped images or fake toys. <image:1>, <image:2>, <image:3>, <image:4>, <image:5>, <image:6>, <image:7>.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/09/zelenskiy-call-attack-kyiv-childrens-hospital): 
Content: The Guardian published an article on July 9, 2024, discussing the Russian missile strikes on Kyiv, including the Okhmatdyt children's hospital. The article mentions that the strikes killed 38 people, including four children. The article includes an image of the aftermath of the strike at Ohmatdyt children's hospital <image:12908>. The article also mentions that the SBU said Moscow targeted the hospital with a Kh-101 cruise missile.

The claim '<image:8> This image shows fake children's toys that were photoshopped into the image by the Ukrainian Government after Kyiv's pediatric hospital was attacked by Russian cruise missiles on July 8, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim that the image depicts photoshopped toys after a Russian attack on a Kyiv hospital on July 8, 2024, is not supported by the evidence. While the attack did occur, as reported by sources like the [Kyiv Independent](https://kyivindependent.com/boys-body-found-under-rubble-in-kyiv/) and [News Ukraine](https://newsukraine.rbc.ua/news/russian-strike-on-kyiv-number-of-killed-and-1720503127.html), there is no information to suggest the image was manipulated or that the toys were fake.

So, the overall veracity is: false
