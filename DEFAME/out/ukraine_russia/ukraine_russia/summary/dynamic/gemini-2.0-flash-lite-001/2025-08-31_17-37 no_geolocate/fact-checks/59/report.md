([https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-no-house-speaker-172533305.html](https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-no-house-speaker-172533305.html)) ![image 1239](media/2025-08-06_18-50-1754506226-785324.jpg), ![image 1241](media/2025-08-06_18-50-1754506233-228521.jpg), ![image 1238](media/2025-08-06_18-50-1754506226-090152.jpg), ![image 1240](media/2025-08-06_18-50-1754506228-024286.jpg) The Conversation published an article discussing the age of US politicians, mentioning Joe Biden, Mitch McConnell, and Nancy Pelosi.

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Euronews article ([https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/01/15/old-false-claims-resurface-about-ukrainian-kickbacks-to-us-politicians](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/01/15/old-false-claims-resurface-about-ukrainian-kickbacks-to-us-politicians)) debunks the claim that the image ![image 18](media/59.jpg) shows a list of US politicians who received bribes from Ukraine, stating there is no evidence to support it. The BBC News article ([https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66272217](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66272217)) discusses allegations that Joe Biden and his son accepted bribes from a Ukrainian firm, but there is no evidence to support these claims.

The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biden%E2%80%93Ukraine_conspiracy_theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biden%E2%80%93Ukraine_conspiracy_theory)) discusses the Biden–Ukraine conspiracy theory, which alleges that Joe Biden took a bribe to pressure Ukraine, and mentions Russian involvement in spreading these false allegations.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the claim is false. The Euronews article explicitly debunks the claim that the image shows a list of US politicians who received bribes from Ukraine, stating there is no evidence to support it. The BBC News article also mentions allegations of bribes involving Joe Biden and a Ukrainian firm, but it also states that there is no evidence to support these claims. Furthermore, the Wikipedia article discusses the Biden–Ukraine conspiracy theory, which alleges that Joe Biden took a bribe to pressure Ukraine, and mentions Russian involvement in spreading these false allegations.


## Final Judgement
The claim is demonstrably false. Multiple sources debunk the claim that the image shows a list of US politicians who received bribes from Ukraine. There is no evidence to support the claim.
