Content: The Economic Times published an article on March 30, 2025, reporting that one of Vladimir Putin's official limousines exploded in Moscow, raising security concerns. <image:5206>, <image:5207>, <image:5208>. The Sun reported that the explosion happened amid rumors surrounding Putin’s health and increasing speculation about threats within Putin’s inner circle. The article also mentions that a video of the burning limousine has gone viral on social media.

The claim 'Russian President Vladimir Putin has died in an explosion in one of his limousines.' is false.
Justification: The claim that Vladimir Putin died in a limousine explosion is not supported by the available evidence. While reports from sources like *Newsweek* and *Hindustan Times* ([Hindustan Times](https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/275000-aurus-senat-limousine-vladimir-putin-goes-up-in-flames-limo-explodes-moscow-assassination-attempt-101743297137628.html)) mention incidents involving Putin's limousines, including a fire and an explosion, none of the reports confirm Putin's death.

So, the overall veracity is: false
