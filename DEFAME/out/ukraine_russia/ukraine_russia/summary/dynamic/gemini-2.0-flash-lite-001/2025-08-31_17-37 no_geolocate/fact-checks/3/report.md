## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The image of The Economist cover featuring Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin with the word "Apocalypse" is fake, according to multiple sources. AAP FactCheck ([Source](https://www.aap.com.au/factcheck/fake-economist-apocalypse-cover-linked-to-pro-kremlin-propaganda/)) points out spelling and grammatical errors in the cover lines, and Ukrinform.net ([Source](https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-factcheck/3930063-russian-propaganda-fabricates-the-economist-cover-about-beginning-of-world-war-iii.html)) states that the cover was created by Russian propagandists. Yahoo News ([Source](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/economist-not-published-apocalypse-cover-154559076.html)) also confirms the image's lack of authenticity. The actual cover of The Economist from November 16, 2024, shows a golf club hitting a globe. ![image 12867](media/2025-08-31_17-39-1756661983-337018.jpg), ![image 12868](media/2025-08-31_17-39-1756661987-192596.jpg), ![image 12885](media/2025-08-31_17-40-1756662015-854175.jpg), ![image 12887](media/2025-08-31_17-40-1756662017-041442.jpg), ![image 12884](media/2025-08-31_17-40-1756662014-779154.jpg), ![image 12888](media/2025-08-31_17-40-1756662019-780100.jpg), ![image 12896](media/2025-08-31_17-40-1756662026-973670.jpg)
