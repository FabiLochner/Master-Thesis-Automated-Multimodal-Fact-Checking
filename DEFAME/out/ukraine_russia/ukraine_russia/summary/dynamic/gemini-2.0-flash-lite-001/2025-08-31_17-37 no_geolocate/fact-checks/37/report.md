## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
According to a Times of India article published on August 3, 2024, Joe Biden boarded the plane to thank the flight crew and remained on the plane for about two minutes after the arrival of freed Americans from Russia (![image 1](media/0.jpg)). Yahoo News reported on August 1, 2024, that Biden boarded the plane to speak to the people who helped bring the three freed prisoners home (![image 672](media/2025-08-06_17-55-1754502948-015026.jpg)). The Guardian also reported on August 1, 2024, on the release of Evan Gershkovich and other Americans in a prisoner swap, showing Biden greeting Evan Gershkovich on the tarmac (![image 675](media/2025-08-06_17-55-1754502958-872284.jpg)).

### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/02/us/politics/biden-greeting-freed-prisoners.html): 
Content: The New York Times published an article about Joe Biden greeting freed prisoners in August 2024. The article includes an image of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris on the tarmac with a plane. ![image 7168](media/2025-08-29_23-25-1756509929-935437.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Joe Biden did board a plane after the freed Americans arrived. However, the claim that the plane was empty is not entirely accurate. According to the Times of India, Biden boarded the plane to thank the flight crew. Yahoo News reported that Biden boarded the plane to speak to those who helped bring the prisoners home. The Guardian also shows Biden greeting one of the freed prisoners on the tarmac.

The evidence suggests that Biden's actions were related to the arrival of the freed Americans, but the claim's assertion that he boarded an empty plane is not fully supported. The evidence suggests that the plane was not empty, as the flight crew was present.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that Joe Biden boarded a plane after the freed Americans arrived. However, the claim that the plane was empty is not entirely accurate, as the flight crew was present.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
Based on reports from the Times of India and Yahoo News, President Biden boarded the plane after the arrival of freed Americans in August 2024, but not after they exited the aircraft. The Times of India states that Biden boarded the plane to thank the flight crew, while Yahoo News indicates he spoke to those who helped bring the prisoners home. Therefore, the claim that Biden boarded an empty plane is inaccurate.
