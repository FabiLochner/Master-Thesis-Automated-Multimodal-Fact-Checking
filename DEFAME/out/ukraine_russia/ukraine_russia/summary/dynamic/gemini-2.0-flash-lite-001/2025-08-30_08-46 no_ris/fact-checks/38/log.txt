Useful result: From [Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/25/zelenskyy-insulted-him-house-gop-to-probe-ukraine-leaders-pa-trip-.html): 
Content: CNBC reports that House Oversight Chair James Comer opened an investigation into Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's visit to an ammunition factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania, claiming it was a campaign event for Kamala Harris, using taxpayer-funded resources. <image:k> The article mentions that Zelenskyy met with Pennsylvania Democrats, including Governor Josh Shapiro, Senator Bob Casey, and Rep. Cartwright, who are up for reelection in November. The article also mentions that Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson claimed the visit was a "partisan campaign event" and "election interference."

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/fact-checking-trump-and-vances-attacks-on-ukrainian-president-zelenskyy): 
Content: PBS NewsHour, citing PolitiFact, fact-checked claims about Zelenskyy's actions in Pennsylvania. The article states that J.D. Vance claimed Zelenskyy "went to Pennsylvania and campaigned for the opposition in October." PolitiFact found this claim to be wrong, as Zelenskyy's visit to a Scranton ammunition plant was not a campaign event. The article also mentions that Zelenskyy met with Pennsylvania Governor Shapiro and separately with President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris at the White House. The article was published on March 2, 2025.

The claim 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy engaged in election interference by campaigning in Pennsylvania for Kamala Harris ahead of the US presidential election in 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim that Volodymyr Zelenskyy campaigned for Kamala Harris in Pennsylvania is not supported by the evidence. While Zelenskyy visited a munitions factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and met with US officials, including Kamala Harris, the visit was not a campaign event, according to a PolitiFact fact-check. Some Republicans viewed the visit as election interference, but this claim was debunked.

So, the overall veracity is: false
