Useful result: From [Source](https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-factcheck/3930063-russian-propaganda-fabricates-the-economist-cover-about-beginning-of-world-war-iii.html): 
Content: The search result from Ukrinform.net states that the cover image of The Economist featuring Trump and Putin with the word "APOCALYPSE" is a fake created by Russian propagandists. The article mentions that the fake cover lacks a publication date, a standard feature of genuine Economist issues. The actual Economist issue published on November 16, 2024, features a globe being struck by a golf club. <image:1576>, <image:1577>, <image:1579>. The article was published on November 19, 2024.

Useful result: From [Source](https://pesacheck.org/altered-this-front-cover-was-not-published-by-the-economist-cd0c20d99b9b): 
Content: The search result from PesaCheck, published on December 9, 2024, states that the cover of The Economist featuring Trump and Putin (<image:2>) is altered. The original cover from March 16, 2024, did not include the image of Trump and Putin. The altered cover also lacks a publication date, which is present on authentic covers.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.aap.com.au/factcheck/fake-economist-apocalypse-cover-linked-to-pro-kremlin-propaganda/): 
Content: The search result from AAP FactCheck states that the image is a fake cover of The Economist magazine. It includes spelling mistakes and errors in the cover lines. The article was published on November 28, 2024, by David Williams. <image:1580>, <image:1581>. The Economist's archive does not include the fake cover. The fake cover has been linked to pro-Kremlin sources.

The claim '<image:2> This image shows a screenshot of an authentic cover of the magazine The Economist from the end of 2024 illustrating Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin and warning of an apocalypse.' is false.
Justification: The image of The Economist cover depicting Trump and Putin with the word "APOCALYPSE" is a fake, as confirmed by multiple fact-checking sources, including [Ukrinform.net](https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-factcheck/3930063-russian-propaganda-fabricates-the-economist-cover-about-beginning-of-world-war-iii.html), [PesaCheck](https://pesacheck.org/altered-this-front-cover-was-not-published-by-the-economist-cd0c20d99b9b), and [AAP FactCheck](https://www.aap.com.au/factcheck/fake-economist-apocalypse-cover-linked-to-pro-kremlin-propaganda/). These sources highlight the absence of a publication date and other inconsistencies, confirming that the image is altered and not a genuine cover of The Economist.

So, the overall veracity is: false
