## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Soviet Union invaded Manchukuo in 1945, resulting in a Soviet victory ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_invasion_of_Manchuria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_invasion_of_Manchuria)). A South China Morning Post article from January 1, 2025, discusses leaked Russian military documents revealing plans to target 160 sites in Japan and South Korea ([https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3293037/russias-uncovered-secret-war-plans-target-160-sites-japan-and-south-korea](https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3293037/russias-uncovered-secret-war-plans-target-160-sites-japan-and-south-korea)). The documents are dated from 2008 to 2014.

Al Jazeera reported on August 6, 2025, that Russian and Chinese naval vessels plan to conduct a joint patrol in the Asia Pacific region ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/6/russia-china-naval-forces-to-carry-out-joint-asia-pacific-patrol-report](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/6/russia-china-naval-forces-to-carry-out-joint-asia-pacific-patrol-report)). The announcement follows joint naval drills in the Sea of Japan.


## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim that China and Japan plan to invade the Russian Federation. The provided sources mention historical events, leaked documents about Russian targeting plans, and joint naval patrols between Russia and China. None of these suggest an invasion plan by China or Japan against Russia.

The evidence does reveal that Russia has planned to target sites in Japan. However, this information does not validate the claim.

To verify the claim, information about any invasion plans by China and Japan against Russia would be needed.


## Final Judgement
The provided evidence does not support the claim that China and Japan plan to invade the Russian Federation. The search results discuss historical events, Russian targeting plans, and joint naval patrols between Russia and China, but do not mention any invasion plans by China or Japan against Russia.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. The search results reveal historical events, leaked documents about Russian targeting plans, and joint naval patrols between Russia and China, but do not mention any invasion plans by China or Japan against Russia.
