The claim '<image:6> This image shows the Chinese Communist Party's Red Cross troops in Russia who have changed into winter clothes and set off for the Russian-Ukrainian front to aid Russia in rescuing its occupied territories.' is false.
Justification: The claim is unverified. While there is evidence of Chinese involvement in activities related to Russia and the Red Cross Society of China's support in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, there is no evidence to confirm that the image depicts Chinese Red Cross troops setting off for the Russian-Ukrainian front.

So, the overall veracity is: false
