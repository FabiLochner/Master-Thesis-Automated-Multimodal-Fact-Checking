## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
On February 21, 2025, articles from Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/2/21/musk-vows-to-fix-x-after-polls-show-high-support-for-ukraines-zelenskyy](https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/2/21/musk-vows-to-fix-x-after-polls-show-high-support-for-ukraines-zelenskyy)) and Northeastern University ([https://cssh.northeastern.edu/musk-vows-to-fix-x-after-polls-show-high-support-for-ukraines-zelensky/](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/musk-vows-to-fix-x-after-polls-show-high-support-for-ukraines-zelensky/)) discussed Elon Musk's statements on X. Musk criticized Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his popularity, and pledged to "fix" X's fact-checking tool.

CNBC ([https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/21/elon-musk-has-problem-with-x-community-notes-after-ukraine-corrections.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/21/elon-musk-has-problem-with-x-community-notes-after-ukraine-corrections.html)) reported that Musk criticized X's Community Notes feature, stating he would "fix" it. The articles mention Musk's disagreement with Community Notes regarding a poll showing high favorability ratings for Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. <image:k> <image:k>


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Elon Musk criticized Volodymyr Zelenskyy and expressed his intention to "fix" X's fact-checking tool and Community Notes. However, the provided sources do not mention Musk planning to suspend Zelenskyy's X account.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the available evidence.

The information missing is whether Elon Musk explicitly stated his intention to suspend Volodymyr Zelenskyy's X account.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
A fact-check by AOL ([https://www.aol.com/fact-check-elon-musk-didn-164103080.html](https://www.aol.com/fact-check-elon-musk-didn-164103080.html)) from November 13, 2024, found no evidence of Elon Musk posting a "last dollar" message for Zelenskyy. ![image 8563](media/2025-08-30_08-55-1756544146-907193.jpg) An article in The Times of India ([https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/this-is-evil-elon-musk-reacts-to-zelenskyys-remarks-on-russia-ukraine-war/articleshow/118696574.cms](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/this-is-evil-elon-musk-reacts-to-zelenskyys-remarks-on-russia-ukraine-war/articleshow/118696574.cms)) from March 4, 2025, reported Musk calling Zelenskyy "evil" regarding the Russia-Ukraine war.


## Elaboration
The evidence provides conflicting information. The AOL fact-check from November 2024 does not mention Musk's plans to suspend Zelenskyy's account. However, the Times of India article from March 2025 reports Musk's negative comments about Zelenskyy.

The claim cannot be verified because the evidence does not explicitly state that Musk planned to suspend Zelenskyy's X account in February 2025.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that while Elon Musk has expressed negative opinions about Volodymyr Zelenskyy, there is no evidence to support the claim that he planned to suspend Zelenskyy's X account in February 2025. The available sources do not mention such a plan.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The fact-check found no evidence to support the claim that Elon Musk planned to suspend Volodymyr Zelenskyy's X account in February 2025. While Musk has criticized Zelenskyy, as reported by [The Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/this-is-evil-elon-musk-reacts-to-zelenskyys-remarks-on-russia-ukraine-war/articleshow/118696574.cms), and expressed intentions to "fix" X's fact-checking tools, as reported by [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/2/21/musk-vows-to-fix-x-after-polls-show-high-support-for-ukraines-zelenskyy), there is no mention of account suspension.
