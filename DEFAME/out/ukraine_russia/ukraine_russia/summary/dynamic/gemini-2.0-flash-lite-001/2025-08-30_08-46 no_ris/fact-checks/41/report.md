## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Wikipedia article on Volodymyr Zelenskyy ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy)) details his career and role as President of Ukraine during the Russo-Ukrainian War, which began on February 24, 2022, when Putin announced a "special military operation" in Donbas. Sky News ([https://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-war-latest-russia-rape-putin-zelenskyy-12541713](https://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-war-latest-russia-rape-putin-zelenskyy-12541713)) also reports on the ongoing war, mentioning its start in 2022.

An Al Jazeera article ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/20/fact-check-did-ukraine-start-its-war-with-russia-as-trump-claims](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/20/fact-check-did-ukraine-start-its-war-with-russia-as-trump-claims)) discusses claims that Ukraine started the war, referencing Donald Trump's statements and the historical context, including Russia's invasion in February 2022. <image:0> The article highlights that Russia initiated the invasion.


### Evidence from `web_search`
The war between Russia and Ukraine began in 2014 with Russia's annexation of Crimea and the war in Donbas, according to [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/event/2022-Russian-invasion-of-Ukraine) and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine). The full-scale invasion by Russia began on February 24, 2022, as stated by [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/event/2022-Russian-invasion-of-Ukraine) and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine). [CIRSD](https://www.cirsd.org/en/horizons/horizons-summer-2022-issue-no.21/the-causes-and-consequences-of-the-ukraine-war) mentions that Putin invaded Ukraine on February 24th, 2022.

The article from [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/event/2022-Russian-invasion-of-Ukraine) mentions that in the early hours of February 24, 2022, Zelensky addressed the Russian people, pleading for peace but vowing to defend Ukraine. ![image 883](media/2025-08-06_18-15-1754504125-782009.jpg), ![image 878](media/2025-08-06_18-15-1754504124-329330.jpg), ![image 879](media/2025-08-06_18-15-1754504124-650968.jpg), ![image 880](media/2025-08-06_18-15-1754504125-155065.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the 2022 war was initiated by Russia. Multiple sources, including Britannica ([https://www.britannica.com/event/2022-Russian-invasion-of-Ukraine](https://www.britannica.com/event/2022-Russian-invasion-of-Ukraine)), and CIRSD ([https://www.cirsd.org/en/horizons/horizons-summer-2022-issue-no.21/the-causes-and-consequences-of-the-ukraine-war](https://www.cirsd.org/en/horizons/horizons-summer-2022-issue-no.21/the-causes-and-consequences-of-the-ukraine-war)) state that Russia began the full-scale invasion on February 24, 2022.

Zelenskyy, as the President of Ukraine, was in a position of defense. He addressed the Russian people, pleading for peace, but vowing to defend Ukraine.

Therefore, the claim that Zelenskyy started the war is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The evidence from multiple sources, including Britannica and CIRSD, indicates that Russia initiated the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Zelenskyy, as the Ukrainian President, was responding to the invasion.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy started the 2022 war in Ukraine is false. Multiple sources, including [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/event/2022-Russian-invasion-of-Ukraine) and [CIRSD](https://www.cirsd.org/en/horizons/horizons-summer-2022-issue-no.21/the-causes-and-consequences-of-the-ukraine-war), confirm that Russia initiated the full-scale invasion on February 24, 2022, while Zelenskyy was in a defensive position.
