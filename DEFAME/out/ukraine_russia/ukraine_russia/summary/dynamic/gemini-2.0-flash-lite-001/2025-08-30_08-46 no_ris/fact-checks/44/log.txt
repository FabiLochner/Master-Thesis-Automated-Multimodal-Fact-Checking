Useful result: From [Source](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/united-states/article/2024/09/30/biden-pledges-to-aid-victims-of-hurrican-helene-as-long-as-it-takes_6727795_133.html): 
Content: Le Monde published an article on September 30, 2024, reporting on President Biden's remarks regarding the response to Hurricane Helene. <image:8653> Biden refuted claims of a slow government response and announced a visit to North Carolina. The article does not mention any announcements about stopping aid for hurricane-affected areas or providing aid to Ukraine.

The claim 'In remarks to reporters on September 29, 2024 US President Joe Biden announced that no more aid would be provided for the areas affected by Hurrican Helene, but 2.4 billion US-$ more for Ukraine.' is false.
Justification: The claim is demonstrably false. Evidence from Le Monde ([https://www.lemonde.fr/en/united-states/article/2024/09/30/biden-pledges-to-aid-victims-of-hurrican-helene-as-long-as-it-takes_6727795_133.html](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/united-states/article/2024/09/30/biden-pledges-to-aid-victims-of-hurrican-helene-as-long-as-it-takes_6727795_133.html)) indicates that Biden pledged aid to Hurricane Helene victims, contradicting the claim of aid cessation. The search results also do not support the claim of additional aid to Ukraine.

So, the overall veracity is: false
