## Elaboration
The evidence supports the claim that American mercenaries were present in the Kursk region. The Anadolu Agency reported that Russia protested the presence of US mercenaries fighting alongside Ukraine in the Kursk region in August 2024 ([https://www.aa.com.tr/en/russia-ukraine-war/russia-formally-protests-us-mercenaries-joining-ukrainian-soldiers-in-kursk-region-/3308755](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/russia-ukraine-war/russia-formally-protests-us-mercenaries-joining-ukrainian-soldiers-in-kursk-region-/3308755)). The image search results confirm that American flag patches are used on military uniforms.

The Al Jazeera article from August 4, 2025, mentions that Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy claimed that foreign mercenaries from various countries are aiding Russia, but it does not mention American mercenaries ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/4/ukraine-says-foreign-mercenaries-from-various-countries-aiding-russia](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/4/ukraine-says-foreign-mercenaries-from-various-countries-aiding-russia)). The Hull Daily Mail also reported on the conflict in the Kursk region.

The evidence indicates that American mercenaries were present in the Kursk region, as reported by the Anadolu Agency. The image search confirms that American flag patches are used on military uniforms.
