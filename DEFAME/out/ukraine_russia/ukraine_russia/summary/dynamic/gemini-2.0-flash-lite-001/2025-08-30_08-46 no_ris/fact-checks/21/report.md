### Evidence from `web_search`
The provided sources discuss Claudia Sheinbaum's statements on drug trafficking and her interactions with Donald Trump regarding the fentanyl crisis. One article from MSNBC, published on December 4, 2024, mentions Sheinbaum's response to Trump's claims about Mexico's role in the fentanyl crisis, stating that Mexico does not consume synthetic drugs. Another article from workers.org, published in February 2025, highlights Sheinbaum's statements on the U.S.'s role in drug consumption and trafficking.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Claudia Sheinbaum declined an invitation to visit Ukraine. However, there is no mention of the alleged quote about drug addicts or Tijuana in the provided sources. The second search reveals Sheinbaum's statements on drug trafficking, but not the quote in question.

Therefore, the claim that Sheinbaum made the specific statement is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that Claudia Sheinbaum declined an invitation to visit Ukraine. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that she made the specific quote about drug addicts and Tijuana.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim that Claudia Sheinbaum made a specific statement about drug addicts and Tijuana in response to an invitation from Volodymyr Zelenskyy is not supported by the available evidence. While she did decline the invitation to visit Ukraine, as reported by multiple sources ([https://www.intellinews.com/mexico-s-president-elect-sheinbaum-turns-down-zelensky-s-invitation-to-ukraine-344262/](https://www.intellinews.com/mexico-s-president-elect-sheinbaum-turns-down-zelensky-s-invitation-to-ukraine-344262/), [https://euromaidanpress.com/2024/09/18/mexican-president-elect-declines-zelenskyys-invitation-to-visit-ukraine/](https://euromaidanpress.com/2024/09/18/mexican-president-elect-declines-zelenskyys-invitation-to-visit-ukraine/), and [https://english.nv.ua/nation/sheinbaum-declines-zelenskyy-s-invitation-focuses-on-domestic-issues-50451798.html](https://english.nv.ua/nation/sheinbaum-declines-zelenskyy-s-invitation-to-visit-ukraine-344262/)), there is no evidence to support the specific quote attributed to her.
