### Evidence from `web_search`
Myth Detector states that Zelenskyy's income decreased after the war began, and his family's financial situation was affected by the temporary suspension of rental income from real estate. According to Forbes, Zelenskyy's net worth is less than $30 million. The article includes links to multiple reports debunking claims about Zelenskyy's real estate holdings. ![image 1930](media/2025-08-07_19-23-1754594600-089015.jpg) The article was published on March 6, 2025.

## Elaboration
The claim is false. Multiple sources, including Yahoo News and Myth Detector, debunk the claim. Zelenskyy's asset declaration shows significantly fewer properties than 15, no private planes, and an annual income of around $300,000. His overseas bank account holds approximately $377,000, not $1.2 billion. There is no evidence of a $35 million home in Florida.

Zelenskyy's real estate portfolio is worth approximately $4 million, including two wholly owned apartments, two co-owned apartments, a commercial property, and five parking spaces. His net worth is less than $30 million. His monthly income as president is $930.

The Pandora Papers revealed that Zelenskyy and his inner circle were beneficiaries of a network of offshore companies.


## Final Judgement
The claim is demonstrably false. Multiple sources provide evidence that contradicts the claim's assertions about Zelenskyy's property, assets, and income. The evidence shows that the numbers are significantly different from what the claim states.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim that Volodymyr Zelenskyy owns 15 homes, a $35 million Florida home, has $1.2 billion in an overseas bank account, three private planes, and a monthly income of $11 million is false. Fact-checks from sources like [Yahoo News](https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-facts-behind-resurfaced-231800640.html) and [The Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/etimes/trending/net-worth-of-volodymyr-zelenskyy-the-entertainer-turned-president-of-ukraine/articleshow/118651819.cms) show that Zelenskyy's actual assets and income are significantly lower. His asset declaration shows fewer than 15 properties, no planes, and an annual income of around $300,000.
