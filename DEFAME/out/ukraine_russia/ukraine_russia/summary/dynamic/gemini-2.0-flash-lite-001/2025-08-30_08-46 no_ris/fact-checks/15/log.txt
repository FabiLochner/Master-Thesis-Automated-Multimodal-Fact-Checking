Useful result: From [Source](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/opinion/article/2025/04/24/russian-and-american-pressure-boost-zelensky-s-popularity_6740575_23.html): 
Content: Le Monde reports that in February 2025, Trump referred to Zelensky as a "dictator without elections". An Ipsos survey conducted between March 5 and 10, 2025, showed that 62% of Ukrainians opposed holding elections at that time. The Economist reported that elections could be held in the summer of 2025 if a ceasefire agreement was reached.

Useful result: From [Source](https://abcnews.go.com/International/zelenskyy-4-approval-trump-claims-50/story?id=118959595): 
Content: ABC News, published on February 19, 2025, states that Donald Trump claimed Volodymyr Zelenskyy's approval rating was 4% in February 2025. However, the article reports that polls show Zelenskyy's approval rating is over 50%. The article mentions a poll from early February showing 57% trust in Zelenskyy. <image:360>

The claim 'In February 2025 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's approval rating in Ukraine was down at 4%.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While Donald Trump claimed Zelenskyy's approval rating was 4% in February 2025, polls showed it was over 50% at the time, and Reuters reported it rose to 67% in March 2025 ([https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/zelenskiys-approval-rating-rises-ukraine-after-trump-spat-poll-shows-2025-03-07/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/zelenskiys-approval-rating-rises-ukraine-after-trump-spat-poll-shows-2025-03-07/)) and ([https://abcnews.go.com/International/zelenskyy-4-approval-trump-claims-50/story?id=118959595](https://abcnews.go.com/International/zelenskyy-4-approval-trump-claims-50/story?id=118959595)).
