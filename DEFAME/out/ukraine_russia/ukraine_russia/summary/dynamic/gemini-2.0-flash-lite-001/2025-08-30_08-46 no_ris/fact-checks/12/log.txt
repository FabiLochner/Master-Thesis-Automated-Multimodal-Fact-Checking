Content: The Daily Mail published an article on August 19, 2025, discussing a meeting between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House. <image:8431>, <image:8432>, <image:8433>, <image:8434>, <image:8435>. The article mentions that Zelensky wore a black suit, which Trump complimented. The article also notes that Zelensky had been criticized for his casual attire in previous meetings. The article does not mention anything about other leaders taking off their suits.

The claim '<image:9> This is an authentic image of world leaders taking off their suits to symbolically support Ukraine at the London summit on Ukraine on March 2, 2025.' is false.
Justification: The image is authentic and shows leaders at the London Summit on Ukraine on March 2, 2025, but there is no evidence to support the claim that the leaders took off their suits to support Ukraine.

So, the overall veracity is: false
