## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The University of California, Berkeley, discusses a video of Donald Trump criticizing Keir Starmer, but the audio is AI-generated and overlaid onto a video interview with Theo Von on August 21, 2024. Neither Trump nor Von discussed the UK or Ukraine in the original video.

## Elaboration
The claim is false. Multiple sources confirm that Donald Trump did not criticize Keir Starmer in an interview with Theo Von in August 2024. One source indicates that an AI-generated audio was overlaid onto a video of the interview. Other sources state that the interview did not mention Keir Starmer or the UK-Ukraine deal.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that the claim is false. Multiple sources confirm that Donald Trump did not make the statements attributed to him in the Theo Von interview. The audio was AI-generated and overlaid onto the video.
