Content: The search result from The War Zone discusses claims of a Ukrainian F-16 shooting down a Russian Su-35S Flanker. It mentions that in August 2024, an F-16 pilot, Oleksiy Mes, was killed during a Russian aerial barrage.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/28/ukraine-war-briefing-zelenskiy-says-f16s-shooting-down-russian-missiles): 
Content: The Guardian published an article on August 28, 2024, stating that Volodymyr Zelenskiy revealed that F-16s were used to shoot down Russian missiles. <image:2868> The article also mentions that Ukraine has tested its first domestically produced ballistic missile.

The claim '<image:5> This image shows a US F-16 fighter jet which was shot down in August 2024 in airspace over the Black Sea after refusing to obey Russian orders.' is false.
Justification: The claim is unsubstantiated. While there are reports of F-16s being involved in incidents, including a crash in August 2024, and claims of Ukrainian F-16s shooting down Russian aircraft, there is no evidence to support the specific claim of a US F-16 being shot down in the Black Sea after refusing Russian orders. The image provided does not confirm the type of aircraft or the circumstances of the event.

So, the overall veracity is: false
