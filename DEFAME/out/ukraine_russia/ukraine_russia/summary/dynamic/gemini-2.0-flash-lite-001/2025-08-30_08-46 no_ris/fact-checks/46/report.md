## Elaboration
The CBS News article about the meeting between Trump and Netanyahu in April 2025 does not mention any plans to resettle Palestinians in Gaza to Ukraine or Syria. The BBC article mentions a plan by Donald Trump for a US takeover of the Gaza Strip and John Bolton suggesting the possibility of resettlement for Palestinians in Gaza, but it does not specify the destination countries.

Based on the provided evidence, the claim cannot be fully verified. The evidence does not confirm that Netanyahu announced plans to resettle Palestinians in Gaza to Ukraine and Syria.


## Final Judgement
The search results indicate that while there were discussions about the Israel-Hamas war and potential resettlement plans, there is no evidence to support the specific claim that Netanyahu announced plans to resettle Palestinians in Gaza to Ukraine and Syria during his April 2025 visit to the White House.
