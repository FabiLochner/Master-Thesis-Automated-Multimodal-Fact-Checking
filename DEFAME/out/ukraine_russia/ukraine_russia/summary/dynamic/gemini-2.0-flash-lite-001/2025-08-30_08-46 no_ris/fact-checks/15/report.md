## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/zelenskiys-approval-rating-rises-ukraine-after-trump-spat-poll-shows-2025-03-07/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/zelenskiys-approval-rating-rises-ukraine-after-trump-spat-poll-shows-2025-03-07/)) reported that Zelenskyy's approval rating rose to 67% in March 2025. ABC News ([https://abcnews.go.com/International/zelenskyy-4-approval-trump-claims-50/story?id=118959595](https://abcnews.go.com/International/zelenskyy-4-approval-trump-claims-50/story?id=118959595)) stated that Donald Trump claimed Zelenskyy's approval rating was 4% in February 2025, but polls showed it was over 50%. ![image 360](media/2025-08-06_17-37-1754501827-201285.jpg) Le Monde ([https://www.lemonde.fr/en/opinion/article/2025/04/24/russian-and-american-pressure-boost-zelensky-s-popularity_6740575_23.html](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/opinion/article/2025/04/24/russian-and-american-pressure-boost-zelensky-s-popularity_6740575_23.html)) reported that Trump referred to Zelensky as a "dictator without elections" in February 2025.


## Elaboration
The claim is partially supported by the evidence. ABC News ([https://abcnews.go.com/International/zelenskyy-4-approval-trump-claims-50/story?id=118959595](https://abcnews.go.com/International/zelenskyy-4-approval-trump-claims-50/story?id=118959595)) states that Trump claimed Zelenskyy's approval rating was 4% in February 2025. However, the same source indicates that polls showed the approval rating was over 50% at that time. Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/zelenskiys-approval-rating-rises-ukraine-after-trump-spat-poll-shows-2025-03-07/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/zelenskiys-approval-rating-rises-ukraine-after-trump-spat-poll-shows-2025-03-07/)) reported that Zelenskyy's approval rating rose to 67% in March 2025.

Therefore, the claim that Zelenskyy's approval rating was down at 4% in February 2025 is not accurate based on the available evidence.


## Final Judgement
The claim is partially accurate as it mentions the 4% approval rating, but it is misleading because it does not include the fact that polls showed a much higher approval rating. The evidence indicates that while someone claimed the approval rating was 4%, the actual approval rating was much higher.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While Donald Trump claimed Zelenskyy's approval rating was 4% in February 2025, polls showed it was over 50% at the time, and Reuters reported it rose to 67% in March 2025 ([https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/zelenskiys-approval-rating-rises-ukraine-after-trump-spat-poll-shows-2025-03-07/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/zelenskiys-approval-rating-rises-ukraine-after-trump-spat-poll-shows-2025-03-07/)) and ([https://abcnews.go.com/International/zelenskyy-4-approval-trump-claims-50/story?id=118959595](https://abcnews.go.com/International/zelenskyy-4-approval-trump-claims-50/story?id=118959595)).
