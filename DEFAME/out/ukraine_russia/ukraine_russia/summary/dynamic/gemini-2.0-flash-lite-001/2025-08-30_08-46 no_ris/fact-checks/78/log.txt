Useful result: From [Source](https://defensescoop.com/2025/04/03/ukraine-russian-tanks-destroyed-attack-drones-cavoli/): 
Content: The Defense Scoop published an article on April 3, 2025, discussing the war in Ukraine. The article mentions that Russian ground forces have lost an estimated 3,000 tanks in the past year. The article also mentions that Ukraine is using one-way attack drones to destroy Russian tanks. The article does not contain the image in the claim.

The claim '<image:26> This image shows destroyed Ukrainian tanks during Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim cannot be verified. While evidence confirms a Ukrainian incursion into Russia's Kursk region in August 2024 and the destruction of military equipment, the specific image in the claim was not found in the search results.

So, the overall veracity is: false
