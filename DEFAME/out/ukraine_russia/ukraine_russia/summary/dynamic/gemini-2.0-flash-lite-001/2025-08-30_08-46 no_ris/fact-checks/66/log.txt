Content: The Soviet Union invaded the Empire of Japan's puppet state of Manchukuo on August 9, 1945, as part of World War II. The invasion, also known as Operation August Storm, caught the Japanese by surprise. The Kwantung Army was the main Japanese force in the area. The Soviets planned a large-scale pincer movement. The 2nd Far Eastern Front was tasked with supporting the attack. The Japanese forces were overwhelmed, and many were taken prisoner and sent to labor camps. The invasion resulted in a Soviet victory.
