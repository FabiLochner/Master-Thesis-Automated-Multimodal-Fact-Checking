BERLIN, Feb 14 (Reuters) - There must be no peace in Ukraine over the heads of Ukrainians and Europeans, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said on Friday at the start of the Munich Security Conference.

"A sham peace - over the heads of Ukrainians and Europeans - would gain nothing," Baerbock said in a statement. Treasury Department on Wednesday announced sanctions on assets of four individuals whom it linked to Mexico-based Cartel del Noreste, including the popular hip-hop artist El Makabelico.

The comment comes after U.S. President Donald Trump startled U.S. This requires tough and long-term security guarantees for Ukraine, a strong NATO and progress in Ukraine's accession negotiations with the European Union," she said.

Content: "That followed a meeting between Zelenskyy and the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, who had visited Kyiv to discuss US access to rare earth minerals, energy resources and energy assets, according to Reuters.

The US has suggested that it would seek access to [rare earth minerals](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/05/donald-trump-rare-earths-ukraine-us-trade-deal-aid-russia)
, which are strategic metals essential for industries developing computers, batteries and cutting-edge energy technology in exchange for providing military aid to Ukraine in the future.

The rapid developments have worried Europe that Putin and Trump appear to be negotiating the future of the continent’s security over the heads of the Europeans themselves.

“If Europe is responsible for Ukraine’s security and could even provide troops \[under a ceasefire agreement\], then we should have a seat at the table and be consulted with the Americans,” said one European official. Our priority right now is to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position.”

Trump’s announcement followed a prisoner swap involving [Marc Fogel,](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/11/russia-us-prisoner-trump-marc-fogel)
 a US teacher who was arrested in Moscow on drug charges, and Alexander Vinnik, who was arrested in 2017 in Greece on cryptocurrency fraud charges and then extradited to the US.

The deal was arranged by Steve Witkoff, Trump’s envoy to the Middle East, one of the president’s closest allies on the team that will lead negotiations with the Russians.

The US negotiating team would include the secretary of state, Marco Rubio; the director of the CIA, John Ratcliffe; the national security adviser, Michael Waltz; and Witkoff.

Notable for his absence from the negotiating team was Gen Keith Kellogg, whom Trump had earlier named his special envoy to Ukraine and Russia and who was in the process of meeting with European leaders to discuss the upcoming negotiations.

Yet few were convinced he spoke directly for Trump, and he offered few concrete details beyond his “deep faith” that Trump was the best person to negotiate the deal, one official said.

Trump says he has spoken to Putin and agreed to negotiate Ukraine ceasefire
===========================================================================

US secretary of defence Pete Hegseth says Ukraine would have to cede territory, alarming Kyiv and European allies

[Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump)
 has said that he and [Vladimir Putin](https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin)
 have agreed to begin negotiations to broker a ceasefire in Ukraine, later adding that it was unlikely Kyiv would win back all its territory or join Nato if a deal is to be reached.

Trump said that he was “OK” with [Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine)
 not having Nato membership and that it was “unlikely” that Ukraine would take much land back in the negotiations.

Russia “took a lot of land, and they fought for that land and they lost a lot of soldiers”, he told reporters later in the Oval Office.

Trump said he was not closely concerned with which territories were handed over.

“I’m just here to try and get peace,” he said. We agreed to work together, very closely, including visiting each other’s Nations.”

The Kremlin confirmed the call and the mutual invitations for the leaders to visit each other’s countries in what would be the first visits by an American president to Russia since 2009 and the first by Putin to the US since 2015.

In its readout, the Kremlin also maintained a maximalist position, with Putin saying he “mentioned the need to eliminate the root causes of the conflict and agreed with Trump that a long-term settlement could be achieved through peaceful negotiations”.

Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy – at least in public – offered support for the talks on Wednesday, saying he and Trump had held a “meaningful” conversation by phone. As President Trump said, let’s get it done.”

'I don't think it's practical': Trump on Nato membership for Ukraine – video

Trump told reporters that the US would seek to “secure” future military aid against Ukrainian rare earth minerals and other natural resources.

Trump said he was not concerned about freezing out Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy of the talks, saying: “I don’t think so as long as he’s there.”

But, he said, “sometime \[Ukraine’s\] going to have to have elections too … His poll numbers aren’t particularly great.”

Trump said Zelenskyy would meet on Friday with the vice-president, JD Vance, and the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, on the sidelines of the Munich security conference.

Earlier on Wednesday, the US negotiating position was outlined in Brussels, where secretary of defence Pete Hegseth delivered public remarks that [Kyiv must acknowledge that it cannot win back all the land occupied by Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/12/us-no-longer-primarily-focused-on-europes-security-says-pete-hegseth)
.

“We must start by recognising that returning to Ukraine’s pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic objective,” Hegseth said, sketching out an initial position for any peace negotiations with Russia.

“Chasing this illusory goal will only prolong the war and cause more suffering,” he added, though this could be interpreted as in effect acknowledging the annexation of Crimea, and large parts of the Donbas, by Russia.

Kyiv would only achieve peace through “robust security guarantees”, but Hegseth ruled out Nato membership for Ukraine. The German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said that Ukraine’s interests must be protected in the upcoming negotiations between Moscow and Washington. “I don’t care so much about anything other than I want to stop having millions of people killed.”

The rapid entry into negotiations with Russia and open demands that Ukraine concede land will have set alarm bells ringing in Kyiv and among its European allies that the Trump administration will offer minimal resistance to Putin’s demands in order to cut a deal as quickly as possible.

In a social media post, Trump said he held a “lengthy and highly productive phone call” with Putin and that they agreed to “have our respective teams start negotiations immediately”.

He said that he and Putin had agreed to visit each other’s countries, later telling reporters that their first meeting would take place in Saudi Arabia.

“As we both agreed, we want to stop the millions of deaths taking place in the War with Russia/Ukraine,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. That includes much of eastern Europe, including Poland and the Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia.

In December, Putin also stated that he would insist on Ukraine adopting a neutral status and implementing some degree of demilitarisation, while also demanding that the west lift its sanctions on Russia.

Kyiv has rejected those demands in the past and the Biden administration had said that it would be up to Ukraine to decide when to hold peace talks.

Earlier this week, [Zelenskyy told the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/11/zelenskyy-europe-cannot-guarantee-ukraines-security-without-america)
 that Europe was not able to offer resilient security guarantees to Kyiv without the involvement of the US. So we must accept this and figure out what we can do.”

Another senior European diplomat called the US position outlined by Hegseth a premature surrender, asking what there would be left to negotiate. The French foreign minister, Jean Noël-Barrot, called for Europe’s direct participation in the talks, saying that there “will be no just and lasting peace in Ukraine without the participation of Europeans”.

A spokesperson for the British foreign office expressed support for Trump’s desire to bring the war to an end, but added: “Russia could do this tomorrow by withdrawing its forces and ending its illegal invasion."

On February 28, 2025, [Donald Trump](/wiki/Donald_Trump "Donald Trump")
, the [president of the United States](/wiki/President_of_the_United_States "President of the United States")
, [JD Vance](/wiki/JD_Vance "JD Vance")
, the [vice president of the United States](/wiki/Vice_president_of_the_United_States "Vice president of the United States")
, and [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy "Volodymyr Zelenskyy")
, the [president of Ukraine](/wiki/President_of_Ukraine "President of Ukraine")
, held a highly contentious bilateral meeting televised live in the [Oval Office](/wiki/Oval_Office "Oval Office")
 at the [White House](/wiki/White_House "White House")
 in [Washington, D.C.](/wiki/Washington,_D.C. Trump subsequently criticized him on his social media platform, [Truth Social](/wiki/Truth_Social "Truth Social")
, where he accused Ukraine of starting the war and called Zelenskyy a "dictator" for not holding elections – even though the Ukrainian constitution prohibits elections during [martial law](/wiki/Martial_law_in_Ukraine "Martial law in Ukraine")
, which was in effect in Ukraine at the time.[\[33\]](#cite_note-33)
 The Trump administration aligned with Russia at the United Nations, voting against a European-backed [General Assembly](/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly "United Nations General Assembly")
 [resolution](/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_ES-11/7 "United Nations General Assembly Resolution ES-11/7")
 on February 24, 2025, to condemn Russia and demand a withdrawal of its troops from Ukraine.[\[34\]](#cite_note-34)

The Trump administration initially intended to cancel Zelenskyy's trip to Washington one week beforehand but was persuaded by French president [Emmanuel Macron](/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron "Emmanuel Macron")
 to proceed with it.[\[35\]](#cite_note-35)
 The administration urged Ukraine to agree to share revenue from its raw minerals with the United States,[\[36\]](#cite_note-36)
 and Zelenskyy had reportedly been planning to sign a [framework agreement](/wiki/Ukraine%E2%80%93United_States_Mineral_Resources_Agreement "Ukraine–United States Mineral Resources Agreement")
 related to raw minerals during his visit.[\[37\]](#cite_note-37)
 The idea for the agreement was originally proposed by Ukraine to the Biden administration in 2024.[\[30\]](#cite_note-woda25-30)
[\[38\]](#cite_note-mysp25-38)
 In January 2025, Ukraine signed a 100-year partnership with the United Kingdom also involving minerals.[\[39\]](#cite_note-39)
 Prior to Zelenskyy's meeting with Trump, senator [Lindsey Graham](/wiki/Lindsey_Graham "Lindsey Graham")
 told Zelenskyy to focus on the present minerals agreement and to discuss a ceasefire and security guarantees later.[\[6\]](#cite_note-:8-6)

A post [shared on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/urbaniulian/posts/10227566798023994)
 claims Germany threatened to cut ties with the United States.

**Verdict: Misleading**

Baerbock did not threaten to cut relations with the United States.

**Fact Check:**

Social media users are claiming that German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock threatened to cut diplomatic ties with the United States. That is why I will support Ukraine as long as it needs it, because it is our peace.”

Germany has not threatened to cut off relations with the U.S, according to [Misbar](https://www.misbar.com/en/factcheck/2025/02/23/germany-has-not-threatened-cut-ties-us-after-talks-russia)

**German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock says European allies should put more pressure on US President Donald Trump's administration in order to avoid losing Washington as a partner, including in talks on the war in Ukraine.**             

Baerbock said on Friday that in order to keep the US as a partner, rather than an opponent allied with Russia, Europe must put pressure on Trump’s administration.

"We are increasing the pressure on the Americans" in order to show them that "they have a lot to lose if they no longer stand by the liberal democracies of Europe," said Baerbock.

Baerbock warned about the new bilateral talks between Russia and the US that took place earlier this week without the presence of Europeans, which aimed at ending the war in Ukraine.

She claimed that Ukraine and by extension Europe could be forced to make painful concessions in a ceasefire agreement.

According to Baerbock, any ceasefire negation without the participation of Europe or Ukraine is "a peace that is not peace but the opposite, further preparation for even more war and violence."

She emphasized that the ceasefire negotiations must take place with the participation of Ukraine and its allies.

Meanwhile, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday held a phone call conversation, during which the two leaders spoke about "ways to achieve a just peace in Ukraine" as Washington pushed for talks with Moscow without involving Ukraine or Europe.

**Trump increases attacks on Zelensky**

US President Donald Trump continued his attacks on Zelensky on Friday.

Trump’s relentless criticism comes amid a wider policy shift on the conflict from the US that included a bilateral meeting with Russia about a ceasefire deal.

In an interview with Fox Radio, he blamed the Ukrainian leader for the start of the war and its continuation.

He also said Zelensky was negotiating for a ceasefire agreement without having any military or political advantage over Russia.

“He’s been at meetings for three years, and he got nothing, so I don’t think he’s very important to be at meetings, to be honest,” said Trump.

Meanwhile, White House National Security Adviser Mike Waltz said on Friday that he believed Ukraine would soon sign a deal that would grant Washington access to Ukraine’s rare earth minerals in exchange for continued support in the war.

While Izvestia reports that Baerbock threatened to sever ties with the US, a fact-check from aol.com states that this claim is misleading. Press TV indicates that Baerbock urged European allies to pressure the US. Therefore, the claim's veracity is uncertain due to the contradictory nature of the evidence.

President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed [during a phone call](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/17/g-s1-54229/trump-putin-call-ukraine-russia)
 on Tuesday to start talks toward a ceasefire in Ukraine, the White House said — with the Kremlin saying it would begin with a 30-day halt to strikes on energy infrastructure.

 with Ukraine.

Zelenskyy [said on social media](https://x.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1902120683699626108)
 on Tuesday that Putin had "effectively rejected the proposal for a full ceasefire" and said that "only a real cessation of strikes on civilian infrastructure by Russia, as proof of its willingness to end this war, can bring peace closer," Zelenskyy said.

### The White House says more negotiations will start immediately

The White House said Trump and Putin agreed to the "energy and infrastructure ceasefire" and technical negotiations on a maritime ceasefire for the Black Sea — with those talks slated to begin "immediately" in the Middle East.

Tuesday's high-stakes call was the latest effort in Trump's efforts to reach an agreement to eventually lead to the end of the Russian war on Ukraine. This was his second call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the issue.**

On Sunday, ahead of the call, Trump told reporters that negotiations have progressed so far that he and Putin would be discussing "dividing up certain assets," including land and power plants.

Trump and Putin also discussed the Middle East and agreed the region could serve as a place for potential cooperation to prevent future conflicts. Accessibility links

Trump, however, maintained in an interview with Fox News Channel's _The Ingraham Angle_ that the topic of aid did not come up during the call, which he said lasted almost two hours.

"We didn't talk about aid. Following the call, Moscow authorities briefly removed an installation supporting Russia's war in Ukraine that had stood in front of the American embassy in Moscow since 2023 — although workers later claimed the structure was removed for cleaning.

Ukrainian lawmakers protest with placards before a vote replacing a law that attempted to curb the powers of anticorruption bodies, in Kyiv, on July 31, 2025 \[Andrii Nesterenko/AFP\]

Published On 2 Aug 20252 Aug 2025

Ukrainian authorities have detained several officials over a “large-scale corruption scheme” in the defence sector, just days after lawmakers restored the independence of the country’s two main investigative bodies.

The National Anti-Corruption Agency (NABU) and the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office (SAP) said in a joint statement on Saturday that they made four arrests in connection with the scheme, which involved the procurement of military drones and signal jamming systems.

“The essence of the scheme was to conclude state contracts with supplier companies at deliberately inflated prices,” they said, adding that the suspects had received kickbacks of up to 30 percent of the contract amounts.

NABU and SAPO said they had caught a sitting lawmaker, two local officials and an unspecified number of National Guard personnel taking bribes. The suspects were not identified in Saturday’s statement.

The Ministry of Internal Affairs also said it had suspended the suspected National Guard members.

The announcement comes after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy came under criticism last month for [trying to take away](/news/2025/7/29/why-zelenskyy-tried-to-curb-autonomy-of-ukraines-anticorruption-agencies)
 the anticorruption agencies’ independence and place them under the control of his prosecutor-general.

The agencies regained their autonomy after Zelenskyy’s move sparked the first antigovernment demonstrations in Ukraine since Russia invaded in 2022.

Zelenskyy, who enjoys far-reaching wartime powers, initially said he needed to bring the agencies under his control because they were inefficient and under “Russian influence”.

But he then said he had heard people’s anger and [submitted a bill](/news/2025/7/24/ukraines-zelenskyy-introduces-new-draft-law-after-anticorruption-protests)
 restoring the agencies’ independence, which was [passed by lawmakers](/news/2025/7/31/ukraine-parliament-votes-to-restore-anti-corruption-agencies-after-protests)
 on Thursday.

“It is important that anticorruption institutions operate independently, and the law passed on Thursday guarantees them all the tools necessary for a real fight against corruption,” Zelenskyy said.

Ukraine’s European allies praised the about-face, having voiced concerns about the original defanging of the agencies.

Top officials had told Zelenskyy that Ukraine was jeopardising its bid for European Union membership by curbing the powers of its antigraft authorities.

In a statement about Saturday’s arrests, Zelenskyy said he was “grateful to the anti-corruption agencies for their work”.

Ukraine’s anti-corruption agencies exposed a corruption scheme involving procurement of military equipment just two days after the parliament reinstated their independence following mass protests and pressure from Brussels.

The National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) and Special Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office (SABO) discovered a “large-scale corruption scheme” that exploited budget funds allocated for defense forces, the agencies said [in a statement](https://t.me/nab_ukraine/3312)
 on Saturday.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the scheme "absolutely immoral,” in a [Telegram post](https://t.me/s/V_Zelenskiy_official)
. None of them were named in the statement.

The corruption involved purchasing equipment [at knowingly inflated prices](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/ukraine-says-it-uncovers-major-drone-procurement-corruption-scheme-2025-08-02/)
 for which the participants illegally received 30 percent of the contract amount, according to the agencies. A similar approach was used in FPV drone procurement, the agencies said.

The revelation by the [anti-corruption agencies](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/08/02/europe/ukraine-corruption-drone-scheme-latam-intl)
 comes after the Ukrainian leadership attempted to subject the oversight of the bodies to the politically appointed prosecutor general of Ukraine. Those involved "were exposed for taking bribes," he said.

The NABU and the SABO said [the scheme included](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20250802-ukraine-anti-corruption-agencies-uncover-major-drone-procurement-graft-scheme)
 a serving member of parliament, regional officials, the head of a unit of the National Guard’s military unit and a director of a company supplying drones. Zelenskyy signed a bill into law on Thursday that [restored independence](https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-protests-volodymyr-zelenskyy-kyiv-power-politics-corruption/)
 to the agencies.

“There can only be zero tolerance for corruption, clear teamwork to expose corruption, and ultimately a fair sentence," Zelenskyy [wrote](https://t.me/V_Zelenskiy_official/15416)
 on Telegram on Saturday. "It is important that anti-corruption institutions work independently, and [the law adopted on Thursday](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gq3xwr357o)
 guarantees them all the opportunities for a real fight against corruption,” he said.

He called for [full and fair accountability](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2025/08/02/ukraine-uncovers-drone-procurement-corruption-scheme/)
. 

“We are counting on fair verdicts,” Zelenskyy said in an [official statement](https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/rosiya-zatyaguye-vijnu-otzhe-bude-otrimuvati-spravedlivi-vid-99281)
 late Saturday. He said only combat officers will hold leadership positions in all logistics units of the National Guard. 

Zelenskyy reinstated the independence of the NABU and the SAPO after domestic protests and a [warning](https://www.politico.eu/article/ursula-von-der-leyen-volodymyr-zelenskyy-europe-ukraine-anti-corruption-watchdog-independence/)
 from European Commission that Ukraine's EU bid was put at risk."

By [Hanna Duggal](/author/duggalhaljazeera-net)

Published On 21 Aug 202521 Aug 2025

After a week of high-stakes diplomacy aimed at halting the war in Ukraine, United States President Donald Trump says he is set on arranging a summit between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Following separate meetings with both leaders, Trump has ruled out sending US troops to Ukraine, but pledged security guarantees to Kyiv and indicated that Washington could provide air support to reinforce a potential deal.

Ukraine, in turn, told reporters at the White House it would obtain US-made weapons purchased by Europeans for an estimated $90bn as part of the effort to bolster its defences.

Which countries are aiding Ukraine?
-----------------------------------

At least 41 countries have contributed to Ukraine’s war efforts monetarily, either through military, humanitarian or financial assistance, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German think tank.

Military assistance includes weapons, equipment and financial aid for the Ukrainian military. These include Australia, Austria, Cyprus, the Republic of Ireland, Japan, Malta, New Zealand, South Korea, Switzerland, China, Taiwan, and India.

The European Union, through the Commission and Council, has also delivered substantial aid to Ukraine.

![INTERACTIVE - Which countries are aiding Ukraine?-1755767959](/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/INTERACTIVE-Which-countries-are-aiding-Ukraine-1755767959.png?quality=80)

How much aid has Ukraine received so far?
-----------------------------------------

So far, Ukraine has received more than 309 billion euros ($360bn) in military, financial, and humanitarian aid, according to the Kiel Institute:

*   **Military aid** – 149.26 billion euros ($174bn – using today’s exchange rate of €1 = $1.17)
*   **Financial aid** – 139.34 billion euros ($163bn)
*   **Humanitarian aid** – 21.04 billion euros ($24bn)

Who are Ukraine’s largest donors?
---------------------------------

The US has committed the largest amount of aid to Ukraine, providing 114.64 billion euros ($134bn) between January 24, 2022 and June 30, 2025, of which:

*   **Military aid** – 64.6 billion euros ($75bn)
*   **Financial aid** – 46.6 billion euros ($54bn)
*   **Humanitarian aid** – 3.4 billion euros ($4bn)

The EU (Commission and Council) is the second biggest donor at 63.19 billion euros ($74bn), followed by Germany (21.29 billion euros or $25bn), the UK (18.6 billion euros or $21bn) and Japan (13.57 billion euros or $15bn).

How much aid has been pledged v allocated?
------------------------------------------

According to the Kiel Institute, European countries have collectively allocated 167.4 billion euros ($195bn) to the war in Ukraine, more than the 114.6 billion euros ($134bn) allocated by the US.

Allocated aid refers to funds or resources that have actually been set aside, delivered, or officially committed for use by Ukraine.

It is different from pledged aid, which is money or equipment promised by a country but not yet delivered or officially set aside.

In total, Europe as a whole has committed 257.4 billion euros ($300bn) and the US 119 billion euros ($139bn).

US aid to Ukraine plummets under Trump
--------------------------------------

Days before Trump took office, the Biden administration gave one final injection of military support to Ukraine with a weapons package of $500m on January 9.

Following the start of the Trump administration’s second term in office, aid to Ukraine has plummeted, with Washington suspending all support, including weapons, in March after a tense meeting with Zelenskyy at the White House.

Trump made claims that the US has given Ukraine more than $300bn in wartime aid. That number has been contested by Ukraine and its supporters, despite the US being the single largest donor country.

What weapons has Ukraine received?
----------------------------------

Ukraine has received various weapons systems from its allies, including armoured vehicles, artillery, aircraft, air defence systems, drones, missiles, and a wide range of support equipment.

According to the Kiel Institute, Poland has supplied its neighbour with the largest number of tanks, totaling 354, while the US leads in providing infantry fighting vehicles (305), howitzers (201), air defence systems (18), and HIMARS rocket launchers (41).

The HIMARS, capable of striking targets just a few metres (feet) wide from nearly 80km (50 miles) away, gave Ukraine a vital long-range precision strike capability that slowed Russian advances early in the war.

NATO defence spending
---------------------

In a news briefing, the White House said the US could help coordinate a security guarantee for Ukraine. Humanitarian relief covers medical, food and other items for civilians, while financial assistance comes in the form of grants, loans and guarantees.

Most contributions to Ukraine have come from NATO, with 29 of its 32 members providing monetary aid, according to the Kiel Institute.

Additionally, 12 non-NATO countries and territories have sent monetary aid to Ukraine. However, Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has ruled out the deployment of troops from NATO countries to help secure a peace deal.

In June, NATO leaders signed a deal to increase defence spending, which is to be achieved over the next 10 years, and is a jump worth hundreds of billions of dollars a year from the current goal of 2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) to 5 percent.

Currently, 23 of the 32 member countries have met this target, with the alliance as a whole spending 2.61 percent of its combined GDP on defence last year.

NATO countries bordering Russia, such as Estonia and Lithuania, have significantly increased their defence spending – from less than 1 percent of their GDP just 10 years ago.

A main aim of this database to quantify the scale of aid to Ukraine and to make the support measures comparable across donor countries. Much of the discussion on aid to Ukraine since the beginning of the war has been anecdotal, while a rigorous quantification has been missing. To value these, we draw on a broad range of sources to identify market prices, choosing an upper bound, when possible, e.g., by using the new purchase price even if much of the military equipment is probably used.

The Ukraine Support Tracker lists and quantifies military, financial, and humanitarian aid pledged to Ukraine since January 24, 2022. *   [Go to main content.](#main "Go to main content.")

A Database of Military, Financial and Humanitarian Aid to Ukraine
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The Ukraine Support Tracker lists and quantifies military, financial and humanitarian support by governments to Ukraine since February 2022. The database is intended to support a facts-based discussion about support to Ukraine. 

We focus on government-to-government transfers into Ukraine. This means that Europe now also leads the US in terms of total volume of military aid provided through industry since the start of the war. To do so, we set up a comprehensive database that brings together information from official, government sources, existing lists of Ukraine aid, and reports by renowned news media.

An important challenge is to **quantify non-financial transfers**, such as in-kind shipments of military equipment, weapons, medicines or foodstuff. We have also not (yet) systematically collected support by international organizations like the Red Cross or the United Nations, mainly because a lack of systematic data and reporting by most such international organizations.

The Ukraine Support Tracker is constantly being expanded, corrected and improved. Suggestions are very welcome and can be sent to [ukrainetracker@ifw-kiel.de](#)

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is not supported by the evidence. While there are reports of corruption within the Ukrainian defense sector, including inflated prices for military equipment ([Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/2/ukraine-says-defence-sector-corruption-scheme-uncovered), [Politico](https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-uncovers-major-corruption-scheme-defense-procurment-days-after-restoring-anticorruption/)), there is no mention of Ukraine selling armaments received from the United States. Sources like Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/21/tracking-us-and-nato-support-for-ukraine-a-full-breakdown](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/21/tracking-us-and-nato-support-for-ukraine-a-full-breakdown)) and the Kiel Institute's "Ukraine Support Tracker" ([https://www.ifw-kiel.de/topics/war-against-ukraine/ukraine-support-tracker/](https://www.ifw-kiel.de/topics/war-against-ukraine/ukraine-support-tracker/)) detail the aid provided but do not mention any arms sales.

A video claiming that USAID, the US government's main overseas aid agency, has paid Hollywood celebrities millions of dollars to visit Ukraine has gone viral on social media and has been amplified by high-profile accounts like Elon Musk.

However, the clip is not real and has hallmarks of a Russian disinformation operation that the BBC has previously investigated.

BBC Verify's Olga Robinson explains why.

An online video claiming The United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the U.S. government’s main overseas aid agency, paid some Hollywood stars to visit Ukraine has been debunked by the BBC.

The BBC Verify division [identified the fake video](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0m12wl0jwpo)
 as part of a Russian disinformation campaign, but only after the false content went viral on social media platforms and was [retweeted on X by Elon Musk.](https://x.com/Shayan86/status/1887286413181296965/photo/1)

Stars mentioned in the video to have received payments included Angelina Jolie, Sean Pean, Jean Claude Van Dam, Orlando Bloom and Ben Stiller.

“These are lies coming from Russian media,” Stiller posted on X (formerly Twitter). Untrue,” Stiller wrote alongside a video from an account titled “I Meme Therefore I Am” that has been [reposted](https://x.com/ImMeme0/status/1887158413597057107)

 appears to feature an audio recording of US President Donald Trump criticising the UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer over aid to Ukraine, energy costs and jobs.

But the audio has been generated by AI and overlaid onto a [video interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g)
 Mr Trump did with podcaster Theo Von on 21 August 2024.

Neither Mr Trump or Mr Von discuss the UK or Ukraine in this video, but instead focus on US healthcare reform, border security and President Trump’s reasons for avoiding drinking and smoking.

**How did we know this was AI-generated?**

We contacted Professor **Hany Farid**, who specialises in digital forensics at the University of California, Berkeley, and is Chief Science Officer at GetReal Labs, a cybersecurity company focused on preventing malicious threats from generative AI.

He told us this is “an obvious—and not particularly well-executed—fake”...

, [former President Donald Trump](https://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/donald-trump/)
 asked the comedian at one point about his use of cocaine, alcohol and history with addiction.

The latest episode of Von's podcast, "[This Past Weekend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g)
" posted Tuesday and was filmed at the Trump National Golf Club Bedminster in Bedminster, New Jersey.

During the episode, Von asked Trump about not drinking and smoking, to which Trump replied that [he never has](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2018/10/01/donald-trump-beer-joke/1488351002/)
, mentioning his older brother, Fred Trump Jr., who he said had a problem with alcohol.

"I tell people, no drugs, no drinking, no cigarettes," Trump said. "I tell that to my kids all the time, I say 'no drugs, no drinking, no smoking.'"

Trump said he looked up to and admired his brother, who died in 1981, calling him an "incredible personality." He added that he's heard alcohol is "tougher to get off of than drugs," to which Von said that he himself is in recovery from drug and alcohol use.

The former president discussed a variety of other topics during the episode, including his relationship with his family, health care, lobbying, President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris and the 2024 presidential election.

**2024 Presidential Election:** [Donald Trump (pretty much) sticks to the script on Harris. Von said, "No, it's horrible, but you do it anyway, just like the guy you're saying with the scotch," referring to an earlier conversation about alcohol.

Trump asked Von which substance he thought was a bigger problem in the U.S.: alcohol or opioids, to which Von responded opioids.

"It is the latest in a long string of assertions by Russian officials, media, and the pro-Kremlin online ecosystem that Ukrainian officials are corrupt and use foreign aid money to enrich themselves." Léa Ronzaud, a senior investigator at research firm Graphika, told NPR in an email.

"It's just so typical of what we see from Russia, \[to\] take advantage of an ongoing crisis for their own ends," said Darren Linvill, a communications professor and co-director of Clemson University's Media Forensics Hub.

The Ukrainian general story first emerged on a pro-Russian Telegram channel four days after the fires started in Los Angeles. Some of the posts amplifying the baseless claim falsely credited it to United24 Media, a website affiliated with the Ukrainian government.

The Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council's Center for Countering Disinformation issued a [statement](https://x.com/CforCD/status/1878381491056501245)
 describing the claim as "Russian propaganda." It said it had verified with United24 Media that it did not create or share the story.

NPR has not obtained evidence that any Ukrainian generals owned homes in Los Angeles that were destroyed by the fires. Both @OlgaBazova and Patterson's posts received user-generated community notes on X citing the Greek fact check.

The unverified claim about the alleged Ukrainian-owned mansions also appeared on other social media platforms including Tik Tok, TruthSocial and the Russian site VK, but did not gain much traction.

The story is the latest example of Russia's shift away from using fake social media profiles impersonating real people, as it did during the 2016 and 2020 U.S. Accounts tied to previous China influence operations spread false claims about the fire's origins.

While the story about Ukrainian officials got more traction than the other narratives about the fires originating from Russia-allied channels, Linvill said, it has not yet spread as widely as previous narratives linked to Russia."

[The hallmarks of Russian-back influence are consistent: trying to erode support for Ukraine, discrediting democratic institutions and seizing on existing political divides.](https://www.npr.org/2024/06/06/g-s1-2965/russia-propaganda-deepfakes-sham-websites-social-media-ukraine)

"It's just so typical of what we see from Russia, \[to\] take advantage of an ongoing crisis for their own ends," said Darren Linvill, a communications professor and co-director of Clemson University's Media Forensics Hub.

The Ukrainian general story first emerged on a pro-Russian Telegram channel four days after the fires started in Los Angeles. Some of the posts amplifying the baseless claim falsely credited it to United24 Media, a website affiliated with the Ukrainian government.

The Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council's Center for Countering Disinformation issued a [statement](https://x.com/CforCD/status/1878381491056501245)
 describing the claim as "Russian propaganda." It said it had verified with United24 Media that it did not create or share the story.

NPR has not obtained evidence that any Ukrainian generals owned homes in Los Angeles that were destroyed by the fires. 

**Transcript:**

MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:

And now to California, where firefighters in Los Angeles are making progress getting those massive wildfires under control. Both @OlgaBazova and Patterson's posts received user-generated community notes on X citing the Greek fact check.

The unverified claim about the alleged Ukrainian-owned mansions also appeared on other social media platforms including Tik Tok, TruthSocial and the Russian site VK, but did not gain much traction.

The story is the latest example of Russia's shift away from using fake social media profiles impersonating real people, as it did during the 2016 and 2020 U.S. Accounts tied to previous China influence operations spread false claims about the fire's origins.

While the story about Ukrainian officials got more traction than the other narratives about the fires originating from Russia-allied channels, Linvill said, it has not yet spread as widely as previous narratives linked to Russia. So this particular narrative, what it alleges is that mansions of eight Ukrainian generals were amongst the homes destroyed."

!Briefing Of The Commander-In-Chief Of The Armed Forces Of Ukraine Valerii Zaluzhnyi <image:2342>

General Valerii Zaluzhnyi was among those reported to have a home in Los Angeles, even though he lives in London now as Ukraine's ambassador to the UK. The Russian propaganda effort is thus to encourage support for the war at home while making those in the West question any aid that has been sent to Kyiv.

"People predisposed to believing narratives like this will take it to be another 'false' datapoint of corruption and largesse in the Ukrainian military, and at the same time, a sweet act of karma that these imaginary mansions are burning to the ground," said Schmidt. The total value of these properties amounts to $90 million and was allegedly purchased with funds provided by the West as part of economic aid to Kyiv after the war began."

Subsequent posts [named Valerii Zaluzhnyi](https://t.me/naspravdiinfo/104501 "https://t.me/naspravdiinfo/104501")
, former Ukrainian four-star general and current ambassador of Ukraine to the United Kingdom, as being among those who have lost their homes.

Satire, But Really Disinformation
---------------------------------

The initial post on Telegram did indeed include the hashtag "сатира" (Russian for satire), but subsequent reposts lacked any mention that it was made in jest. Yet, even as "satire," it isn't clear where the humor lies in the original post, except possibly to Russian audiences who might find joy that any Ukrainian would see their home burns down in the devastating California fires.

"There is zero evidence that any Ukrainian generals own any property in L.A., much less mansions," said Dr. It's not just about the misinformation – it's about how quickly it crosses platforms and gains traction."

Disinformation Fits An Existing Narrative
-----------------------------------------

All of these disinformation campaigns have a common thread – they're based on the unsubstantiated belief that Ukrainian officials are getting rich while the war continues. Matthew Schmidt, professor of national security and political science at the University of New Haven.

Humor likely wasn't even the point, and instead, the channels posting the claims likely wanted it to be believed as fact – much like the news last summer that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spent $15 million to [buy a Mercedes 770 automobile](https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2024/10/09/despite-online-claims-ukraines-zelensky-didnt-buy-hitlers-car/ "https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2024/10/09/despite-online-claims-ukraines-zelensky-didnt-buy-hitlers-car/")
 that was previously owned by Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler, or that Zelensky's wife purchased a [Bugatti sports car](https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2024/07/02/social-media-posts-claim-zelenskys-wife-spent-millions-on-bugatti-sportscar/ "https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2024/07/02/social-media-posts-claim-zelenskys-wife-spent-millions-on-bugatti-sportscar/")

A post [shared on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=3936628693283593&id=100008095036730)
 claims billionaire Elon Musk posted a “last dollar” for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

**Verdict: False**

There is no evidence that Musk posted this.

**Fact Check:**

Musk joined President-elect Donald Trump on his phone call with Zelenskyy, according to [The Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-ukraine-elon-musk-zelenskyy-starlink-f6ab0c5e1c5de1262ae2a1747247819c)
. Musk has become a part of Trump’s inner circle, the outlet reported.

Social media users are claiming that Musk posted that Zelenskyy had received his “last dollar.” These claims show an image of a purported tweet from Musk, which states, “The last dollar for Zelenskiy” and is accompanied by a dollar with Trump in the middle.

These claims are false. 6 tweet.

> [](https://twitter.com/CforCD/status/1854169532924891301?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

“The tweet attributed to Elon Musk about the alleged ‘last dollar for Zelenskyy’ featuring a bill with Donald Trump’s portrait is fake. This is fabricated content intended for manipulation and provocation,” reads the tweet.

Logically Facts also [debunked](https://www.logicallyfacts.com/en/fact-check/no-elon-musk-didnt-post-the-last-dollar-for-zelenskyy)
 this claim, saying that Ukrainian and Russian Telegram channels spread the fake image, though noted the Ukrainian channels said it was satire.

From [Source](https://www.politico.eu/article/billionaire-elon-musk-mocks-ukraine-president-zelenskyy-asking-aid-with-meme/): 
Content: "[Skip to main content](#main)

Billionaire entrepreneur [Elon Musk mocked Ukraine’s war-time leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1708629197617336398)
 on Monday, using a meme to scoff at the president’s calls for Western aid.

“When it’s been 5 min and you haven’t asked for a billion dollars in aid,” read Musk’s message, which accompanied Zelenskyy’s head attached to a famous photo of an agitated schoolboy, who — according to the [meme’s etymology](https://medium.com/@tazreen.noman/the-origin-of-michael-mcgee-vein-popping-guy-ad41c63190f0)
 — was in a classroom and desperately trying to hold in flatulence.

Musk has had a troubled relationship with Ukrainians and the country’s administration since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion in February 2022, but now they’ve had just about enough of the SpaceX chief and owner of X (formerly Twitter).

“So you have bought social media to bully people who are dying because \[they\] love freedom,” Ukrainian stand-up comedian Anton Tymoshenko [wrote](https://twitter.com/_Tymoshenko/status/1708716338196214196)
 in response to Musk’s post.

“Elon, did you write this meme during a friendly conversation with Putin on the phone?” another Ukrainian comic and volunteer, Vasyl Baydak, [wrote](https://twitter.com/by_by_duck/status/1708711638268878922)
 — alluding to a [New Yorker report](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/08/28/elon-musks-shadow-rule)
 that Musk and the Russian president spoke directly.

Even Ukrainian media organizations joined the anti-Musk revolt, with top publication Ukrainska Pravda [posting](https://twitter.com/pravda_eng/status/1708732658182701406?s=20)
 the same meme, but with Musk’s face photoshopped in, saying: “When’s it’s been 5 minutes and you haven’t spread Russian propaganda.”

Zelenskyy has not yet reacted to Musk’s post. But that narrative flipped after he began spreading what Ukraine said was [pro-Russian propaganda](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/03/ukrainian-officials-and-allies-rail-against-elon-musk-tweet-00060085)
 via his social media.

According to a new biography of the tech boss, Musk also secretly ordered his engineers to [disable Starlink satellite](https://www.politico.eu/article/elon-musk-ukraine-starlink-russia-crimea-war-drone-submarine-attack-sabotage/)
 communications near the coast of Russian-occupied Crimea last year to sabotage a planned Ukrainian drone strike.

Last week, the [European Commission slammed Musk’s X](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_NCu44_Xc0)
 as the social media platform which is the biggest source of disinformation. President Joe Biden [signed](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/09/30/biden-administration-congress-government-shutdown-deal-ukraine-aid-00119296)
 a temporary budget bill featuring no Ukraine aid to avert the American government’s shutdown.

Shortly after Putin’s assault on Kyiv began last year, Musk was hailed in Ukraine thanks to his early decision to provide Starlink satellite internet for the country. But one of his office advisers, Serhiy Leshchenko, hit back [in a tweet](https://twitter.com/Leshchenkos/status/1708720295681421701)
 accusing Musk of “trolling.”

Musk’s meme comes shortly after U.S."

**_UNITED24_** **did not report such information, and neither did any other credible source.**

Ukraine has found an alternative to the American satellite system Starlink, a number of pro-Russian sources [report](https://archive.ph/JTBdd)
 citing _UNITED24_. At the same time while commenting on this decision communications officer Ruslana Danilkina allegedly spoke obscenely about Elon Musk in the context of his recent comments about Ukraine.

! On her [personal page](https://www.instagram.com/rusya_danilkina/)
, she also did not publish any offensive comments about Elon Musk, and did not comment on this news invented by propagandists.

For now, Ukraine continues to use the Starlink system, despite the tensions in relations with the United States. They had previously used the _UNITED24_ brand identity to spread the fake that [eight villas of Ukrainian generals burned down in Los Angeles.](https://www.stopfake.org/en/fake-eight-villas-belonging-to-ukrainian-generals-burned-down-in-los-angeles/)

And secondly, Ruslana Danilkina, who was called a communications officer in the video, does not actually currently hold combat positions in the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Electronic warfare equipment manufacturer and former Air Force officer Anatoly Khrapchinsky [considers](https://www.unian.ua/war/starlink-hrapchinskiy-poyasniv-chi-maye-ukrajina-alternativu-suputnikovomu-zv-yazku-12932037.html)
 the Starlink shutdown unlikely: _«Both Trump and Musk are about money. That’s why they won’t give up multibillion-dollar, multimillion-dollar contracts."

A limousine said to be part of [Vladimir Putin](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/vladimir-putin)

Social-media users viewed the viral footage of the burning Aurus Senat car, which is believed to be worth around $350,000. The incident took place near the headquarters of Russia's main intelligence agency, the FSB, according to reports.

_Newsweek_ has contacted the Kremlin for comment.

There were no reports of injuries and no details about the cause of the fire, according to German outlet _Bild._ The story of the incident was also widely picked up by media outlets including those in Ukraine.

The German newspaper said that the incident had caused panic in the Kremlin, noting that security is tight around the Russian president when he travels.

Newsweek AI is in beta. The cause of the fire is not known, and it is not clear whether the vehicle had been personally used by Putin, but the Russian leader has reportedly displayed paranoia about assassination plots.

What To Know
------------

The Aurus limousine blew up on Sretenka Street just north of the FSB headquarters in Lubyanka on Saturday night, with video footage showing the fire spreading to the vehicle's interior.

Onlookers can be seen watching back smoke billowing out of the front of the destroyed vehicle, and the rear of the car also seemed to be damaged.

It is not clear who was using the car, but it is said to be owned by Putin's Presidential Property Management Department, British newspaper _The Sun_ reported. The independent Russian language outlet Meduza [said that Putin](https://www.newsweek.com/putin-decries-massive-blunder-after-top-general-assassinated-2003548)
 had called the incident a major security lapse.

Video from Putin's visit last week to the Arctic city of Murmansk showed servicemen from a ceremonial guard being patted down for hidden weapons or explosive devices before the president came to lay a wreath by the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.

What People Are Saying
----------------------

**_The Sun_ newspaper wrote:** "An Aurus limousine from Putin's 'official car fleet' blew up in a huge blast on a street just north of Moscow's FSB secret service headquarters in Lubyanka."

**Ukrainian X user Devana posted:** "Not just Russia is burning—even Putin's limo went boom. So hey, Vladimir—if even your car goes up in flames next to FSB HQ … maybe the system's cracking from within?"

What Happens Next
-----------------

Official comment about the car blast is unlikely, but security around Putin will continue to dominate headlines. [Russia's special services have ramped up](https://www.newsweek.com/putin-spending-personal-security-russia-ukraine-arrest-warrant-icc-1803885)
 the [already-strict security measures](https://www.newsweek.com/putin-bulletproof-vest-armor-public-events-security-1908361)
 surrounding the Russian leader to an unprecedented degree, unnamed Russian and Kremlin officials told _The Moscow Times_ in June 2024.

The video of the alleged explosion has gone viral on social media, leading to speculation of an assassination attempt on the Russian leader
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A £275,000 Aurus Senat limousine, believed to be from Russian President Vladimir Putin's official car fleet, reportedly exploded and caught fire on a street in Moscow near the country's top intelligence agency FSB's headquarters.

The incident is said to have taken place on March 29 on a street north of Moscow’s FSB headquarters, located near the Lubyanka, according to EuroWeekly.

A purported video of the alleged explosion has gone viral on social media, leading to speculation of an assassination attempt on the Russian leader amid talks backed by the United States to end Moscow's war in Ukraine.

In the viral video, workers from nearby establishments could be seen helping to extinguish the fire, which is believed to have started from the car's engine bay area and spread to its interiors.

Thick smoke was seen flowing out of the vehicle, whose front portion is also believed to have been damaged in the incident.

It was not immediately clear who was present in the car during the incident, as no injuries were reported, according to The Sun.

It is suspected that the fire started in the car’s engine and quickly engulfed the entire vehicle, EuroWeekly reported.

### **Ukraine war**

Ukrainian government and military analysts speaking to AP expected Russia to launch a fresh offensive across the 1,000-kilometer front line to strengthen its negotiating position ahead of potential talks with Kyiv.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia is getting ready for new offensives in the northeastern regions.

Putin escapes assassination bid? stuck in endless and pointless discussions about fake ‘conditions’ just to buy time and then try to grab more land,” Zelenskyy said Thursday in a visit to Paris.

The two sides have stepped up their aerial attacks even as US President Donald Trump pushes them to agree to a ceasefire after more than three years of intense fighting.

Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of breaching commitments to not strike energy facilities.

Zelensky also rejected Putin's idea of a “transitional administration”, backed by the United Nations, in Ukraine and said it was Putin's latest ploy to delay a peace deal.

Six MQ-9 drones have been downed since the start of a large-scale air campaign.

Three U.S. airstrikes in Sanaa, Yemen, April 7, 2025.

AP

Seven Reaper drones have been brought down by the Houthis since the beginning of March, with six of them occurring since March 15 and three of them over the past week, the official said. official told ABC News.

But in that time, the Houthis have successfully been able to shoot down a significant number of MQ-9 Reaper drones that provide real-time surveillance and reconnaissance information that is key in finding the targets for those airstrikes.

! At least 15 Reapers have been brought down by the Houthis since October 2023, when they began targeting commercial shipping in the Red Sea region in what they claim was done in support of Hamas.

The U.S. The impact has been limited because the Houthis have fortified those bunkers, officials said.

! Central Command acknowledged an airstrike against the Houthi-controlled Ras Isa Fuel Port that it said was a funnel point for fuel that the Houthis used for their attacks on commercial shipping.

"The objective of these strikes was to degrade the economic source of power of the Houthis, who continue to exploit and bring great pain upon their fellow countrymen," a statement from U.S. military has provided few details about the airstrike campaign against the Houthis that the Trump administration has described being much larger than anything undertaken during the Biden administration. The Trump administration has said the intent of the airstrike campaign is for the Houthis to cease their attacks on commercial ships in the Red Sea region.

The last publicly available number of how many U.S. airstrikes had been carried out came from White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt two weeks after the start of the air campaign, when she said more than 200 airstrikes had already been launched.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that the Houthis shot down a US MQ-9 Reaper drone in March 2025. The web search results confirm this, citing multiple sources. However, the image's geolocation data indicates that the image was most likely taken in Israel.

The claim states that the image shows a US drone shot down by the Houthis. The evidence does not confirm that the image depicts a drone shot down by the Houthis. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.

The evidence does not provide information about the type of missiles used or the exact location of the incident depicted in the image.

2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:20> This image shows a US drone which was shot down in March 2025 by the Houthis using Russian missiles."

## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:20>)
web_search("US drone shot down Houthis March 2025")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.64, 'Palestine': 0.13, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.12, 'Jordan': 0.08, 'Tunisia': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0, 'Austria': 0.0}

### Evidence from `web_search`
ABC News reports that Houthi militants have shot down six MQ-9 Reaper drones since March 15, 2025, as stated in an article published on April 23, 2025, by Luis Martinez. The Military Times published an article on April 25, 2025, stating that Houthi rebels in Yemen have shot down seven U.S. Reaper drones in recent weeks. The U.S. has been launching daily strikes since March 15, 2025.

Wikipedia discusses the March–May 2025 United States attacks in Yemen, mentioning that the Houthis shot down a US MQ-9 Reaper drone in March 2025. The article also mentions several US airstrikes in Yemen during April 2025, the Red Sea crisis, and the Gaza war. <image:i>, <image:8693>, <image:20>


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the Houthis shot down a US MQ-9 Reaper drone in March 2025. The web search results confirm this, citing multiple sources. However, the image's geolocation data indicates that the image was most likely taken in Israel.

The claim states that the image shows a US drone shot down by the Houthis. The evidence does not confirm that the image depicts a drone shot down by the Houthis. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.

The evidence does not provide information about the type of missiles used or the exact location of the incident depicted in the image.

US President Donald Trump is focused on peace and has made unprecedented progress in the negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, US Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard told NDTV in an exclusive conversation today.

Here are the top 10 quotes by Tulsi Gabbard:
--------------------------------------------

1. "Trump remains very committed to combating and defeating the threat of Islamist terrorism. "Trump is also taking action where the previous administration failed. So, President Trump has taken a decisive action for our own safety, security, and prosperity."
    

8. "President Trump is seeing this ongoing conflict with very clear eyes. "Under the previous administration, there was no effort at all towards peace or direct dialogue with Putin to bring an end to this war. So, in a very short period of time, Trump has made much more progress towards peace than any other previous effort. The talks are just beginning between Trump's incoming cabinet and the Bangladesh government, but this continues to remain a central focus area of concern."

Newsweek AI is in beta. So already in a very short period of time, President Trump has made much more progress towards peace than any effort that has occurred by anyone, previously.

"I'm sure that President Trump will have a very productive conversation with Putin, once again, rooted in his unwavering commitment to peace."

In the same interview, **Gabbard** also hailed Trump's relationship with Indian Prime Minister [Narendra Modi](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/narendra-modi)
: "With President Trump's leadership in the United States, of course Prime Minister Modi's longstanding leadership here in India, we have two leaders of our two great countries who are very good friends and who are very focused on how we can strengthen those shared objectives and those shared interests."

What Happens Next
-----------------

Trump and Putin are slated to speak over the phone on Tuesday.

_This article contains reporting by The Associated Press._

_Correction 3/18/25, 8:43 a.m. ET: This article was updated to delete erroneous Associated Press reporting and clarify comments Tulsi Gabbard made about the relationship between President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi._

_Update 3/17/25, 6:41 p.m. Her visit to India holds special significance: Gabbard, a veteran, was the first Hindu elected to [Congress](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/congress)
 when she served as a representative from Hawaii.

What To Know
------------

Gabbard criticized former President [Joe Biden](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/joe-biden)
's handling of the war in Ukraine and said Trump's push for both sides to agree to a ceasefire comes from an "unwavering commitment to peace."

!Trump and Putin <image:1416>

U.S. That prompted Zelensky to say he was ready to sign a rare earth minerals deal that the Trump administration has pushed for in exchange for continued aid to Ukraine.

Last week, Ukraine agreed to the U.S.'s proposal for a 30-day ceasefire, subject to the Kremlin's agreement.

What People Are Saying
----------------------

**Gabbard criticized the Biden administration's handling of the Russia-Ukraine war, telling NDTV:** "Under the previous administration, during which this war began, there was no effort, there was no effort at all towards peace.

Macron warns against 'escalation' after Biden brands Putin 'butcher'
====================================================================

Kyiv (AFP) – France's President Emmanuel Macron warned Sunday against a verbal "escalation" of Russia's invasion in Ukraine, after US President Joe Biden branded Vladimir Putin a "butcher" who "cannot remain in power".

 ![Macron warns against 'escalation' after Biden brands Putin 'butcher'](https://s.france24.com/media/display/99f8a93a-e6c1-11ee-9116-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/img-default-F24.jpg)

The Kremlin had reacted in fury over Biden's comments which it said narrows the window for bilateral relations, with Russia's invasion of Ukraine now into a second month.

Macron said he would speak to Putin in the next two days to organise the evacuation of civilians from the heavily bombarded port city of Mariupol.

The French leader told broadcaster France 3 that he saw his task as "achieving first a ceasefire and then the total withdrawal of (Russian) troops by diplomatic means."

"If we want to do that, we can't escalate either in words or actions."

Ukraine was making a new push to get civilians out of the city on Sunday, with an aid route agreement for people to leave by cars or on evacuation buses, said Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk.

Several attempts at establishing safe routes for civilians to flee have collapsed as both sides trade blame for violating temporary ceasefires.

Mariupol, in the region of Donetsk, has borne the brunt of Russia's assaults, and residents who managed to flee have recounted harrowing scenes of death and destruction.

About 170,000 people remain trapped in the besieged city and authorities have said they fear some 300 civilians may have died in a Russian strike on March 17 that hit a theatre being used as a bomb shelter.

Several attempts at establishing safe routes for civilians to flee have collapsed as both sides trade blame for violating temporary ceasefires FADEL SENNA AFP

In an impassioned speech from the Royal Castle in Warsaw, Biden blasted Putin over Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

"For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power," the US leader said, before the White House clarified that Washington was not seeking regime change.

The Kremlin snapped back, saying "a head of state should stay sober".

'Going to die anyway'
---------------------

Personal attacks, said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, were "narrowing down the window of opportunity" for bilateral relations.

"Biden is weak, sick and unhappy," said Vyacheslav Volodin, president of the lower house of parliament.

Putin sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, vowing to destroy the country's military and topple pro-Western President Volodymyr Zelensky.

But his army has made little progress on capturing key cities, and it has hit hospitals, residential buildings and schools in increasingly deadly attacks on civilians.

In Kharkiv, where authorities reported 44 artillery strikes and 140 rocket assaults in a single day, residents were resigned to the incessant bombardments.

Anna Kolinichenko, who lives in a three-room flat with her sister and brother-in-law, said they do not even bother to head down to the cellar when the sirens go off.

"If a bomb drops, we're going to die anyway," she told AFP. Like a volcano is exploding, as if the earth explodes," she said as she rested on a chair at an evacuation centre on the outskirts of Kyiv.

Recapture town

"I write poems and when there are explosions I feel great inspiration."

Bombardments continued over the last 24 hours in Irpin, as well as other cities around Kyiv, said Ukrainian authorities.

With the conflict now into a second month, Ukraine's determined fighters continue to hold back Russia's far-bigger military Aleksey Filippov AFP

Ukraine's determined fighters continue to hold back Russia's far-bigger military on the frontlines, and some units are beginning to snatch back control.

Two people were killed by shelling in the village of Stanislav, close to the city of Kherson, where Ukrainian forces have mounted a counter-offensive.

In an update early Sunday, the Ukrainian General Staff said "the allied forces repulsed seven attacks" and destroyed eight tanks in the Donetsk and Lugansk areas of the Donbas.

The Ukrainian defence ministry said its forces had also recaptured Trostianets, a town near the Russian border that was one of the first to fall under Moscow's control.

Images published by the ministry showed Ukrainian soldiers and civilians among heavily damaged buildings and what appeared to be abandoned Russian military equipment.

Elsewhere, Russian forces took control of Slavutych, the town where workers at the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear plant live, briefly detaining the mayor, Ukrainian authorities said.

Residents of the town protested, prompting the Russians to fire shots in the air and lob stun grenades into the crowd, they added.

The International Atomic Energy Agency said it was "closely monitoring the situation" and was concerned about the ability of employees at Chernobyl to rotate and return to their homes to rest.

'One percent'
-------------

"There has been no staff rotation at the NPP for nearly a week now," the IAEA said.

Russia's army, which Western analysts said appeared bogged down by tactical, communications and logistics problems, had suggested on Friday it would shift its concentration to eastern Ukraine.

But Biden had cast doubt, saying he was "not sure" Moscow has indeed changed its objectives.

Biden, who was winding up a whirlwind visit to Poland after holding a series of urgent summits in Brussels with Western allies, met key Ukrainian cabinet ministers on Saturday.

In a possible shift on a plan to transfer Soviet-era fighter jets from Poland to Kyiv to boost Ukraine's firepower in the skies -- rejected last month by the Pentagon as too "high risk" -- Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the United States now did not object.

"As far as we can conclude, the ball is now on the Polish side," Kuleba said in written comments to AFP after the meeting.

In a video address, Zelensky reiterated a call for planes while urging allies to supply Ukraine with more weapons.

"During the meeting..."

**What was claimed:** A video shows the president of France, Emmanuel Macron, calling Vladimir Putin a “butcher” and commenting on his “war crimes” during a press conference with US president Donald Trump.

**Our verdict:** This isn’t quite right. Mr Macron referred to killings in the Ukrainian town of Bucha and mentioned war crimes, but did not describe President Putin as a “butcher”.

France's President Emmanuel Macron warned Sunday against a verbal "escalation" of Russia's invasion in Ukraine, after US President Joe Biden branded Vladimir Putin a "butcher" who "cannot remain in power."

The Kremlin had reacted in fury over Biden's comments which it said narrows the window for bilateral relations, with Russia's invasion of Ukraine now into a second month.

Macron said he would speak to Putin in the next two days to organize the evacuation of civilians from the heavily bombarded port city of Mariupol.

The French leader told broadcaster France 3 that he saw his task as "achieving first a ceasefire and then the total withdrawal of (Russian) troops by diplomatic means."

"If we want to do that, we can't escalate either in words or actions."

Ukraine was making a new push to get civilians out of the city on Sunday, with an aid route agreement for people to leave by cars or on evacuation buses, said Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk.

Several attempts at establishing safe routes for civilians to flee have collapsed as both sides trade blame for violating temporary ceasefires.

Mariupol, in the region of Donetsk, has borne the brunt of Russia's assaults, and residents who managed to flee have recounted harrowing scenes of death and destruction.

About 170,000 people remain trapped in the besieged city and authorities have said they fear some 300 civilians may have died in a Russian strike on March 17 that hit a theatre being used as a bomb shelter.

In an impassioned speech from the Royal Castle in Warsaw, Biden blasted Putin over Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

"For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power," the US leader said, before the White House clarified that Washington was not seeking regime change.

The Kremlin snapped back, saying "a head of state should stay sober."

### **“Going to die anyway”**

Personal attacks, said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, were "narrowing down the window of opportunity" for bilateral relations.

"Biden is weak, sick and unhappy," said Vyacheslav Volodin, president of the lower house of parliament.

Putin sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, vowing to destroy the country's military and topple pro-Western President Volodymyr Zelensky.

But his army has made little progress on capturing key cities, and it has hit hospitals, residential buildings and schools in increasingly deadly attacks on civilians.

In Kharkiv, where authorities reported 44 artillery strikes and 140 rocket assaults in a single day, residents were resigned to the incessant bombardments.

Anna Kolinichenko, who lives in a three-room flat with her sister and brother-in-law, said they do not even bother to head down to the cellar when the sirens go off.

"If a bomb drops, we're going to die anyway," she told AFP. <image:1440>\

### **Recapture town**

"I write poems and when there are explosions I feel great inspiration."

Bombardments continued over the last 24 hours in Irpin, as well as other cities around Kyiv, said Ukrainian authorities.

Ukraine's determined fighters continue to hold back Russia's far-bigger military on the frontlines, and some units are beginning to snatch back control.

Two people were killed by shelling in the village of Stanislav, close to the city of Kherson, where Ukrainian forces have mounted a counter-offensive.

In an update early Sunday, the Ukrainian General Staff said "the allied forces repulsed seven attacks" and destroyed eight tanks in the Donetsk and Lugansk areas of the Donbas.

The Ukrainian defense ministry said its forces had also recaptured Trostianets, a town near the Russian border that was one of the first to fall under Moscow's control.

Images published by the ministry showed Ukrainian soldiers and civilians among heavily damaged buildings and what appeared to be abandoned Russian military equipment.

Elsewhere, Russian forces took control of Slavutych, the town where workers at the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear plant live, briefly detaining the mayor, Ukrainian authorities said.

Residents of the town protested, prompting the Russians to fire shots in the air and lob stun grenades into the crowd, they added.

The International Atomic Energy Agency said it was "closely monitoring the situation" and was concerned about the ability of employees at Chernobyl to rotate and return to their homes to rest.

### **"One percent"**

"There has been no staff rotation at the NPP for nearly a week now," the IAEA said.

Russia's army, which Western analysts said appeared bogged down by tactical, communications and logistics problems, had suggested on Friday it would shift its concentration to eastern Ukraine.

But Biden had cast doubt, saying he was "not sure" Moscow has indeed changed its objectives.

Biden, who was winding up a whirlwind visit to Poland after holding a series of urgent summits in Brussels with Western allies, met key Ukrainian cabinet ministers on Saturday.

In a possible shift on a plan to transfer Soviet-era fighter jets from Poland to Kyiv to boost Ukraine's firepower in the skies -- rejected last month by the Pentagon as too "high risk" — Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the United States now did not object.

"As far as we can conclude, the ball is now on the Polish side," Kuleba said in written comments to AFP after the meeting.

In a video address, Zelensky reiterated a call for planes while urging allies to supply Ukraine with more weapons.

[!Russia Notes US Hypocrisy in California Fire Case <image:4830>](/en/news/2025/01/12/3236714/russia-notes-us-hypocrisy-in-california-fire-case)

### TEHRAN (Tasnim) - Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova commented on reports that hundreds of prisoners have been mobilized to extinguish fires in the US state of California, pointing to the hypocrisy of the US.

[\- Other Media news -](/en/service/1200/other-media)

Earlier, The Washington Post, citing the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, reported that the state authorities had sent 395 prisoners to fight forest fires. The diplomat noted that in 2023, Washington restricted imports of products from several Chinese companies in an attempt to exclude goods allegedly produced with the help of Uygur forced labor from the US supply chain.

"This raises a logical question: will Congress draft a bill imposing sanctions on California authorities, private companies, and ordinary Americans for using prison labor to put out fires?" she wondered. "We are so sick of this hypocrisy!" Zakharova added.

Wildfires began to spread across Los Angeles County on January 7."

Did Russia offer sanctuary to California residents who lost their homes in the Los Angeles fires? A viral X [post](https://x.com/jacksonhinklle/status/1879042008465183185)
 by Jackson Hinkle—a [regular purveyor](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/11/business/media/jackson-hinkle-israel-gaza-misinformation.html)
 of Russia-related misinformation—claims so.

“BREAKING: RUSSIA has offered shelter & sanctuary to Californians whose livelihoods were DESTROYED in the LA wildfires,” reads the post, which had more than 500,000 views on X as of January 15. 

[Fact Check](https://thedispatch.com/category/fact-check/)

Assessing Claims That Russia Offered Sanctuary to California Fire Victims
=========================================================================

One Russian governor did make an offer, but there are some caveats.

! A single Russian governor said that he would welcome California fire victims to the region of occupied Ukraine he oversees, but only if they don’t support the government in Kyiv.

On Monday, Vladimir Saldo, the governor of the Russian-occupied Kherson oblast region of Ukraine, [told](https://tass.ru/obschestvo/22867057)
 _TASS_—a Russian state-controlled media outlet—that the region would accept any Americans who lost their homes in this month’s California fires. “Despite the ongoing, blatantly anti-Russian policy of the United States, we fully understand that natural disasters don’t care who you are or what you do,” Saldo said, [according to](https://www.rt.com/russia/610836-california-fires-sanctuary-kherson/)
 Russia Today, a Russian state-controlled network that translated the statement into English. Therefore, our region is ready to welcome any American citizen who has lost their home and livelihood.”

That offer comes with a caveat, applying only to Californians who haven’t supported Ukraine since Russia invaded its borders in February 2022. Sutton")

Other Russian Telegram channels are also spreading false or unverified narratives about the southern California fires and the government's response, as well as amplifying critiques from Americans including the president-elect's son, Donald Trump, Jr., Andy Carvin of the Atlantic Council's DFRLab told NPR in an email.

"Over the last week, Pravda has published at least 350 stories of this type \[based on Telegram messages about the fires\], based on our initial content analysis of the site," Carvin said.

### Evidence from `web_search`
Tasnim News Agency published an article on January 12, 2025, discussing Russia's comments on the California wildfires, including comments from Maria Zakharova. The article mentions that wildfires began to spread across Los Angeles County on January 7. ([https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2025/01/12/3236714/russia-notes-us-hypocrisy-in-california-fire-case](https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2025/01/12/3236714/russia-notes-us-hypocrisy-in-california-fire-case)) <image:4830>, <image:4831>

The Dispatch published an article on January 15, 2025, discussing claims that Russia offered sanctuary to California fire victims. Vladimir Saldo offered to accept Americans who lost their homes in the California fires, but only those who haven't supported Ukraine since February 2022. ([https://thedispatch.com/article/assessing-claims-that-russia-offered-sanctuary-to-california-fire-victims/](https://thedispatch.com/article/assessing-claims-that-russia-offered-sanctuary-to-california-fire-victims/)) <image:4838>

An NPR article, published on January 16, 2025, discusses how pro-Kremlin social media accounts spread a false narrative about the Los Angeles wildfires.

In this pool photograph distributed by the Russian state agency Sputnik on July 25, 2024, Syria's President Bashar al-Assad meets with Russian president at the Kremlin in Moscow on July 24, 2024. Many Alawites were part of Assad’s government, while the former dictator himself is a member of the group, per the outlet.

Social media users are claiming to show Assad’s Russian passport, the country where Assad fled after his regime fell. ‘Aleksandrovich’ is a [patronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/)
, “Imyarek” is a placeholder family name,” reads the image description.

Logically Facts also [debunked](https://www.logicallyfacts.com/en/fact-check/edited-image-passed-off-as-bashar-al-assads-asylum-passport-in-russia)

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim that the image shows an authentic Russian passport of Bashar al-Assad is false. An AOL article explicitly states that the image is fake and photoshopped. Additionally, the search results mention that Bashar al-Assad fled to Moscow and was granted political asylum, which could be a reason for him to obtain a Russian passport. However, the evidence provided confirms that the image is not authentic.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

The devastating Russian-Ukrainian war has been ongoing for several years, with the United States and NATO providing support to Ukraine. A report can be read [here](https://tass.com/russia/1728697)
. 

**Clarification:**

Peskov’s Comments: It is important to note that Peskov’s remarks about the United States being an “enemy” were part of a broader narrative criticizing American policies and actions towards Russia. The confusion may stem from a recent shift in Russian officials’ rhetoric amid ongoing tensions over the Ukraine conflict.

**Background:**

**Recent Statements by Russian Officials:** Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov referred to the United States as an “enemy” state in a recent press interaction. More details can be read [here](https://www.trtworld.com/us-and-canada/russia-formally-declares-the-us-as-enemy-what-next-18170984)
.

**Misinterpretation**: Peskov’s statement, “We are now an enemy country for them, just as they are for us,” has been misinterpreted on social media as a declaration of war. This is a significant escalation from the term “unfriendly states” that Russian officials have used previously to describe the United States and its allies.

**Context**: Peskov’s comments followed actions by the Biden administration, allowing Ukraine to use American-supplied weapons to attack targets within Russia. In this context, a significant amount of misleading information regarding the situation is being spread on social media.

**Social Media Posts** 

Social media posts claim that Russia has declared war against the USA.

! Details can be read [here](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy770l9llnzo)
. 

**Historical Rhetoric:** Russian President Vladimir Putin has previously referred to the Western countries’ elites as Russia’s enemies while characterizing Ukraine as a tool used by the West. The rhetoric from Russian officials reflects escalating tensions but does not amount to a declaration of war. Social media users should be cautious about misinterpreting or amplifying such statements without verifying the facts through reliable sources.

Ukrainians sought shelter in underground shelters as Russian forces attacked on 24 February 2022

Launching the biggest European invasion since the end of World War Two, Putin gave a fiery speech on TV declaring his goal was to "demilitarise and denazify" Ukraine.

Russia has repeatedly painted modern Ukraine as a Nazi state, in a crass distortion of history.

Putin had already seized Ukraine's Crimean peninsula eight years earlier, after a revolution that ousted Ukraine's pro-Russian president and replaced him with a more pro-Western government.

Putin then triggered a lower-level war in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, with pro-Russian proxy forces occupying territory and setting up rebel states supported by Moscow.

But the 2022 invasion was on a different scale.

Putin had just [recognised the rebel states as independent](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-europe-60470900)
. He has spoken of the Ukrainian leader's "illegitimacy" - a false narrative that has also been repeated by President Trump.

As evidence Putin cites the postponement of Ukraine's March 2024 presidential election, although it is because of Russia's war that Ukraine is under martial law and elections are barred under the constitution.

Putin's own re-election in 2024 is highly questionable, as Russia's opposition leaders are either in exile or dead.

Was Nato expansion to blame for the war?
----------------------------------------

Putin has for years complained about Nato's eastward expansion as a security threat, and sees any possibility of Ukraine joining the alliance as a major red line.

Before Russia's 2022 invasion he demanded that Nato remove multinational deployments from the Central and Eastern European states that joined the Western alliance after 1997.

But it was Russia that launched military action in Eastern Europe, when it invaded Georgia in 2008 and then Crimea in 2014.

After the Crimea invasion, Nato established a continuous presence on its eastern flank - closest to Russia.

Nato has always stressed the whole purpose of the alliance is to defend territories "with no aggressive intentions". <image:2680>!A map showing the expansion of Nato over time <image:2687>

Zelensky said as much two weeks into the invasion: "Nato is not prepared to accept Ukraine."

He has since said he would consider resigning in exchange for Nato membership, but Trump says Kyiv should "forget about" joining the Western alliance.

Putin has accused Nato of participating in the war, because its member states have increasingly sent Ukraine military hardware, including tanks and fighter jets, air defence systems, missile systems, artillery and drones.

Nato has provided security assistance and training to Ukraine, but it insists that does not make it a party to the war.

Putin's grievance against Nato dates back to 1990, when he claims the West promised not to expand "an inch to the East".

However that was before the Soviet Union collapsed and it was based on a limited commitment made to then Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.

Gorbachev said "the topic of Nato expansion was never discussed" at the time.

How could the war end?
----------------------

The most likely route is through direct talks, although previous rounds of negotiations between the two sides made little progress on a ceasefire.

After a fifth visit to Moscow by Trump envoy Steve Witkoff on 6 August, the US president said a there was a "good chance" he could meet the Russian and Ukrainian leaders for talks in person.

The Kremlin also said a Trump-Putin meeting would happen in the coming days, but Putin ruled out an imminent meeting with Zelensky, saying the right conditions were not in place.

So far though, the two sides have been unable to find a way of bridging their differences.

Russia wants direct talks to address the "root causes of the conflict", a phrase that harks back to Putin's "maximalist" demands at the start of the war in March 2022.

These included Ukraine becoming a neutral state, dramatically reducing its military and abandoning its Nato aspirations.

Russia also wants international recognition of its territorial gains in Ukraine reflected in any future deal, including annexation of Crimea and four eastern regions. <image:2680>!Reuters Vladimir Putin remembering Russia's victory over Nazi Germany wears a long coat as soldiers pass him by carrying swords <image:2689>Reuters

Vladimir Putin has made repeated false allegations of genocide and Nazi taunts against Ukraine

At the start of the 2022 invasion, Putin vowed to protect people in occupied areas of eastern Ukraine from eight years of Ukrainian "bullying and genocide, during the war in the east.

More than 14,000 people died on both sides of the front line between 2014-2022, but Russian claims of Ukrainian Nazis committing genocide in the occupied regions never added up, and no international body has spoken of genocide. It abandoned its nuclear weapons in 1994 in return for guaranteed security from Russia, the UK and US which Moscow failed to respect.

Since the war, many Ukrainians have turned their back on Russian, and Zelensky himself avoids using the language in public.

When Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered up to 200,000 soldiers into Ukraine, his aim was to sweep into the capital, Kyiv, in days, overthrow its pro-Western government and return Ukraine to Russia's sphere of influence.

Putin failed but, more than three years on, a fifth of Ukrainian territory is in Russian hands.

US President Donald Trump has been trying to negotiate a peace deal and the Kremlin says Putin will meet Trump "in the coming days". Last year he told US TV talk show host Tucker Carlson that Ukraine was an "artificial state".

Those comments have led many to believe that the goal of the invasion was in effect to erase the state of Ukraine.

Russia's state-run Ria news agency explained that "denazification is inevitably also de-Ukrainisation" - seemingly tying the idea of erasing Ukraine to the stated goal of the invasion.

Ukrainian culture and identity have in fact existed for centuries independently of Russia.

Does Putin want to get rid of Zelensky?
---------------------------------------

! <image:2680>!Getty Images The president of Ukraine holds his hands out, flanked by two Ukrainian flags <image:2685>Getty Images

Volodymyr Zelensky was elected president in Ukraine in 2019

Putin has long sought to get rid of Ukraine's elected pro-Western president, and Zelensky was apparently a target from the very start of the war.

Russian troops made two attempts to storm the presidential compound soon after the invasion, according to Zelensky's adviser, and Ukraine's elected leader said they wanted him dead.

"The enemy has designated me as target number one; my family is target number two.

"[They want to destroy Ukraine politically](https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/zvernennya-prezidenta-do-ukrayinciv-naprikinci-pershogo-dnya-73149)
 by destroying the head of state."

Zelensky said later that Putin had initially tried to replace him with the wealthy head of a pro-Russian party, Viktor Medvedchuk, who was accused of treason in Ukraine and is now in Russia.

Even now, Putin has not agreed to peace talks with Zelensky and his officials call him a "loser" and a "clown". It will also look for Western security guarantees to ensure Russia never invades its territory again.

Was Zelensky to blame for the war?
----------------------------------

Before his return to the White House and in the first months of his presidency, Trump suggested Ukraine's president was responsible for the war with Russia.

"\[Zelensky\] should never have let the war start, that war's a loser," he said in October 2024.

In reality, the war began in 2014, when Putin seized Crimea and Russian proxies grabbed part of eastern Ukraine. Putin then ordered Russia's full-scale invasion eight years later, after months of meticulous co-ordination and denials of any such plan.

However, the US president's messaging has not been altogether consistent, and in recent weeks his position appears to have hardened against Russia.

"We thought we had \[the war\] settled numerous times, and then President Putin goes out and starts launching rockets into some city like Kyiv and kills a lot of people," he said last month.

Trump has announced sweeping new secondary tariffs on any country still trading with Russia if a ceasefire with Ukraine is not agreed by Friday, 8 August.

Do Putin's claims on Nazis and genocide stack up?

Content: "After each of them—Serbia in 2000, Georgia in 2003, Ukraine in 2004, the Arab Spring in 2011, Russia in 2011–12, and Ukraine in 2013–14—Putin has pivoted to more hostile policies toward the United States, and then invoked the NATO threat as justification for doing so.

Boris Yeltsin never supported NATO expansion but acquiesced to the first round of expansion in 1997 because he believed that his close ties to President Bill Clinton and the United States were not worth sacrificing over this comparatively smaller matter. Following John Mearsheimer’s provocative 2014 _Foreign Affairs_ article arguing that “the Ukraine crisis is the West’s fault,” the narrative of Russian backlash against NATO expansion has become a dominant framework for explaining—if not justifying—Moscow’s ongoing war against Ukraine.[1](#f1)
 This notion has been repeated not only in Moscow but in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere by politicians, analysts, and writers. By this telling, the specter of Ukraine’s NATO membership points both to the cause of the conflict and its solution: Take membership off the table for Ukraine, so the argument goes, and future wars will be prevented.

### Michael McFaul

_**Michael McFaul**, former U.S. If NATO was _always_ a threat to Russia and its “sphere of influence,” why did Putin facilitate the opening of these bases in the former Soviet Union?

During his November 2001 visit to the United States, Putin struck a realistic but cooperative tone:

> We differ in the ways and means we perceive that are suitable for reaching the same objective . Putin blamed the United States directly for assisting this democratic breakthrough and helping to install someone whom he saw as a pro-American puppet, President Mikheil Saakashvili. Since the Revolution of Dignity, Putin has waged an unprecedented assault against Ukraine’s democracy using a full spectrum of military, political, informational, social, and economic weapons in an attempt to destabilize and eventually topple Ukraine’s democratically elected government.[18](#f18)
 Ukraine’s relationship with NATO and the United States was just a symptom of what Putin believes is the underlying disease: a sovereign, democratic Ukraine.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

From [Source](https://www.russiamatters.org/blog/russias-economy-collapsing): 
Content: "For one, the [IMF](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2025/01/17/world-economic-outlook-update-january-2025)
 and [World Bank](https://thedocs.worldbank.org/en/doc/c50bc3c87bc2666b9e5fa6699b0b2849-0050012025/related/GEP-Jan-2025-Analysis-ECA.pdf)
 estimate that the Russian economy grew by 3.8% and 3.4%, respectively, in 2024.3 Looking ahead, both expect the Russian economy to continue growing in 2025–2026, even though this growth is expected to slow down. The same year saw 19 new Russian dollar billionaires join Forbes’s ranking, which is the highest number of new dollar billionaires Russia has produced since 2011, according to [Re: Russia](https://re-russia.net/en/analytics/0233/)
.

As the economy grew in 2024, so did Russia’s budget revenues, even though this growth was not sufficient to eliminate the aforementioned budget deficit. Olga Chyzh of the University of Toronto also took a dim view of the Russian economy in her recent commentary for The Guardian, entitled “A string of assassinations, a [faltering economy](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/dec/19/russia-assassinations-economy-workers-putin)
, a shortage of workers: the pressure on Putin is ratcheting up.” In this Dec. 2024, commentary, Chyzh writes that Russia’s “economy is faltering under the combined strain of the war and Western sanctions.” “War-driven salary increases … have triggered a vicious cycle of inflation and subsequent interest-rate hikes. Writing in The Hill in October 2024, he predicts that a “Russian economic meltdown is coming next year.” “Leonid Brezhnev’s Soviet Union should have taught Putin a lesson,” warns Motyl, who has repeatedly predicted [Russia’s collapse](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=Alexander+Motyl+Russia+collapse)
. 5, 2024, entitled “[The collapse of the Russian economy](https://www.counteroffensive.news/p/the-collapse-of-the-russian-economy)
,” on American journalist Tim Mak’s Substack, “Counteroffensive.” The Kyiv-based Euromaidan Press outlet then published a commentary by [Yurii Bohdanov](https://euromaidanpress.com/author/yuriybohdanov/ "View all posts by Yurii Bohdanov")
 on Jan. 17, 2025, in which he claims that “even ‘freezing’ the war in Ukraine will not solve Russia’s economic problems… and a freeze only delays the inevitable collapse.” 

### Russia Doesn’t Have a Clean Bill of Health

Some of the aforementioned criticism of what the [IMF](https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/PPPSH@WEO/OEMDC/ADVEC/WEOWORLD)
 ranks as the world’s 4th largest economy in terms of PPP is valid. In fact, Russia’s budget revenues in December 2024 reached more than 4 trillion rubles ($40 billion), up by 28% compared to December 2023, the highest level recorded in ministry data beginning from January 2011, according to [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-21/russia-s-budget-revenue-surges-to-record-in-december-despite-sanctions "(opens in a new window)")
.5 One sector of the Russian economy which provides much of the money6 that is accumulated in the Russian budget and that the Kremlin then spends on its war, is the energy sector. Gazprom, the national gas champion, is estimated to have lost more [than $3 billion](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/gazprom-reports-9-month-loss-32-billion-2024-10-29/)
 in the first nine months of 2024, for instance.)

### Conclusion 

No economy is completely healthy, and Russia’s is, by far, no exception, particularly given Western sanctions and its rampant spending on the military-industrial complex and the war against Ukraine.

Is Russia’s Economy Collapsing?
===============================

February 06, 2025

[Simon Saradzhyan](/authors/simon-saradzhyan)

The past few months have seen a number of Russia watchers echo each other’s proclamations that the Russian economy is either already collapsing or close to crumbling. 

Will these predictions materialize?

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The IMF website provides information about Russia, including its membership date, quota, and Special Drawing Rights, and includes a link to the July 2025 World Economic Outlook Update, which projects a 0.9% change in real GDP for 2025 (<image:2695>). The IMF ranks Russia as the world's 4th largest economy in terms of PPP.

The article from russiamatters.org mentions that in December 2024, Russia's budget revenues reached more than 4 trillion rubles ($40 billion), the highest level recorded since January 2011. The article was published on February 06, 2025.

Content: "Alexander Nemenov / AFP

The International Monetary Fund has [downgraded](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2025/07/29/world-economic-outlook-update-july-2025 "downgraded")
 its forecast for the Russian economy, signaling the end of a short-lived wartime growth surge and forecasting a return to stagnation.

In its July World Economic Outlook Update, the IMF projects Russia’s GDP will grow just 0.9% in 2025, a steep drop from last year’s 4.1% expansion. The revised forecast marks a 0.6 percentage point downgrade from the IMF’s April report — the largest cut among all major economies.

The world economy is expected to grow by 3% this year and 3.1% in 2026.

Developing nations are forecast to grow at roughly 4% annually, while Russia’s economy is expected to edge up by just 1% in 2026.

Over the next two years, Russia’s growth rate will be less than half that of the U.S., which is projected to grow by 3.9%, and will trail far behind China (9%) and India (6.4% annually in 2025 and 2026).

The IMF attributes the slowdown to tighter economic policies and falling global oil prices, which have eroded the key revenue streams that helped prop up Russia’s wartime economy.

The average price of Brent crude is forecast to drop 13.9% this year to $68.18 per barrel, with a further decline to $64.33 expected in 2026.

Petya Koeva-Brooks, deputy director of the IMF’s research department, said Russia’s performance in the first quarter of 2025 fell well short of expectations.

According to state statistics agency Rosstat, year-on-year growth dropped to 1.4%, down from 4.5% in the previous quarter and sharply below the 5.4% growth seen in the same period last year.

On a quarterly basis, the economy contracted for the first time since 2022. Petersburg Economic Forum in June, Economy Minister Maxim Reshetnikov [warned](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2025/06/19/russias-economy-minister-warns-of-looming-recession-a89510 "warned")
 that the country was “on the edge of an economic downturn.”

Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina delivered an even starker message, [saying](https://kyivindependent.com/russias-war-fueled-economy-is-running-on-empty-central-bank-chief-warns/ "saying")
 that the resources which had fueled wartime growth “have truly been exhausted.”

Nabiullina pointed to labor shortages, idle production capacity and dwindling reserves from the National Wealth Fund.

The fund’s liquid assets have reportedly fallen by two-thirds since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Those sectors had shrunk 0.9% year-on-year by late June, according to estimates from the government-affiliated Center for Macroeconomic Analysis and Forecasting.

Top Russian officials are beginning to acknowledge the economic risks.

Russia repaid its borrowing of $3.3 billion from the IMF three years early in 2005.[\[109\]](#cite_note-109)

[Inflation](/wiki/Inflation "Inflation")
 remained a problem however, as the [central bank](/wiki/Bank_of_Russia "Bank of Russia")
 aggressively expanded [money supply](/wiki/Money_supply "Money supply")
 to combat appreciation of the ruble.[\[110\]](#cite_note-Emerging_Markets-110)

SummarizeResultPrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
In order to find evidence that helps your fact-check, you just ran a web search which yielded a Search Result. **Your task right now is to summarize the Search Result.** What to include:
* information that might be useful for the fact-check (see Record)
* relevant images (refer to images by inserting their reference <image:k>)
* if available: the release date as well as the author or the publisher (e.g. the media company) of the search result.

Do NOT include:
* advertisements
* any other information not related to the Record or the Claim

Additional rules:
* Do not add any additional information besides the information in the Search Result.
* If the Search Result doesn't contain any relevant information for the fact-checking work, simply print one word in capital letters: "NONE".
* Keep your writing style like in the Examples 1, 2 and 3 provided to you.
* Try to filter out relevant information even if the search result is in a different language.

# Example 1
The search result from America Today provides several photographs of the Notre-Dame Cathedral fire on April 15, 2019. <image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>. None of the images show the Eiffel Tower in the background. 

# Example 2
NONE

# Example 3
The Guardian discusses a report blaming the Syrian government for a toxic gas attack and condemning their use of chemical weapons.

According to The Guardian, The White House condemned the Assad regime for defying the norm against chemical weapons use.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "In October 2024 the International Monetary Fund (IMF) declared Russia the fourth-largest economy in the world."

## Actions
```
web_search("IMF Russia economy ranking October 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The IMF website provides information about Russia, including its membership date, quota, and Special Drawing Rights, and includes a link to the July 2025 World Economic Outlook Update, which projects a 0.9% change in real GDP for 2025 (<image:2695>). The IMF ranks Russia as the world's 4th largest economy in terms of PPP.

The article from russiamatters.org mentions that in December 2024, Russia's budget revenues reached more than 4 trillion rubles ($40 billion), the highest level recorded since January 2011. The article was published on February 06, 2025.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the IMF ranks Russia as the world's 4th largest economy in terms of PPP. However, the evidence does not specify the exact date when this ranking was made. The evidence also includes a link to the July 2025 World Economic Outlook Update.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified because the exact date of the IMF's ranking is not explicitly stated in the provided evidence.

!IMF ranks Russia as world’s fourth-largest economy by purchasing power <image:8824>

**Russia just clinched fourth place on the global economic ladder, based on purchasing power parity (PPP), in new data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).**

This makes Russia one of the top contributors to global economic growth, moving ahead of several Western economies. PPP adjusts for price differences across countries, giving more weight to nations with large populations and lower costs of living.

With this [ranking](https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2024/10/24/tr102424-transcript-of-eur-reo)
, Russia now joins China, the U.S., and India in the top four, adding muscle to the economic power of BRICS. This year alone, they’ve met twice, once in Beijing and once at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Kazakhstan.

Putin is also working closely with India, maintaining New Delhi as a strategic ally from the Cold War era despite Russia’s tight relations with India’s rival, China.

Western allies have tried to get Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to press Moscow on Ukraine, but he has avoided criticizing [Russia](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/russian-crypto-queen-stole-for-ukraine-army/)
, focusing instead on peace and his seemingly close friendship with Putin.

[!World Bank sold $510 million in bonds backed by loans to 57 companies in emerging markets. Over the next five years, the IMF sees China, India, Russia, and Brazil driving growth far more than the Group of Seven (G7), which includes the U.S., Germany, and Japan.

G7 countries, known for their strong GDPs, are now expected to contribute less, with BRICS economies filling in the gap.

### BRICS outpaces G7

Among the BRICS, China is expected to lead the charge, contributing 22% of global growth through 2029 — more than all G7 countries combined. The IMF’s PPP model shows that developing nations, thanks to their populations and relatively lower prices, are playing a stronger role in the global economy.

In surprising detail, the IMF’s numbers illustrate this trend. Over the next five years, the IMF sees China, India, Russia, and Brazil driving growth far more than the Group of Seven (G7), which includes the U.S., Germany, and Japan.

## Claim
Claim: "In October 2024 the International Monetary Fund (IMF) declared Russia the fourth-largest economy in the world."

## Actions
```
web_search("IMF Russia economy ranking October 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The IMF website provides information about Russia, including its membership date, quota, and Special Drawing Rights, and includes a link to the July 2025 World Economic Outlook Update, which projects a 0.9% change in real GDP for 2025 (<image:2695>). The IMF ranks Russia as the world's 4th largest economy in terms of PPP.

The article from russiamatters.org mentions that in December 2024, Russia's budget revenues reached more than 4 trillion rubles ($40 billion), the highest level recorded since January 2011. The article was published on February 06, 2025.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the IMF ranks Russia as the world's 4th largest economy in terms of PPP. However, the evidence does not specify the exact date when this ranking was made. The evidence also includes a link to the July 2025 World Economic Outlook Update.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified because the exact date of the IMF's ranking is not explicitly stated in the provided evidence.
