## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results indicate that the Hull Daily Mail from March 13, 2025, exists. One source, from [mythdetector.com](https://mythdetector.com/en/british-hull-daily-mail/), states that the image in the claim is falsified, and the actual issue does not mention Ukraine. The article was published on March 17, 2025. Another source, from [magzter.com](https://www.magzter.com/GB/Reach-Publishing-Services-Limited/Hull-Daily-Mail/News/2023954?srsltid=AfmBOoqTSROYXfWSCNnJjzNlPL-FwMP5Yq_k0ESWpru9Vq4oC3aQXhx2), shows the front page of the Hull Daily Mail from March 13, 2025, which includes the same image as the claim. ![image 1](media/0.jpg), ![image 66](media/2025-08-06_17-26-1754501162-718406.jpg), ![image 44](media/2025-08-06_17-25-1754501124-685634.jpg), ![image 66](media/2025-08-06_17-26-1754501162-718406.jpg), ![image 73](media/2025-08-06_17-26-1754501202-576951.jpg)


### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results indicate that the image of the Hull Daily Mail front page from March 13, 2025, with the headline "70,000 Ukrainian soldiers in the Kursk region died in vain" is fake. Both [Gwara Media](https://gwaramedia.com/en/debunking-russian-fakes-hull-daily-mail-didnt-write-about-70000-ukrainian-soldiers-killed-in-russias-kursk-oblast/) and [The Journal.ie](https://www.thejournal.ie/ukraine-hull-daily-mail-debunk-6657051-Mar2025/) debunk the image, stating that the real front page had a different headline. The fake image was spread on social media and pro-Russian sources. ![image 1451](media/2025-08-07_13-39-1754573946-256635.jpg), ![image 1452](media/2025-08-07_13-39-1754573949-807201.jpg), ![image 1454](media/2025-08-07_13-39-1754573951-547510.jpg), ![image 1470](media/2025-08-07_13-41-1754574071-817295.jpg), ![image 1471](media/2025-08-07_13-41-1754574072-732356.jpg), ![image 1472](media/2025-08-07_13-41-1754574075-181803.jpg)
