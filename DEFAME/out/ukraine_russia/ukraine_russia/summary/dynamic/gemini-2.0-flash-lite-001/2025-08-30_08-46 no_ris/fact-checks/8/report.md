## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Chinese troops have been involved in activities related to Russia, including military drills and participation in Victory Day parades. The Red Cross Society of China has also been involved in supporting the response to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that the image depicts Chinese Red Cross troops setting off for the Russian-Ukrainian front to aid Russia in rescuing its occupied territories.

The evidence does not provide enough information to verify the claim. More information is needed to confirm the specific activities and the purpose of the troops in the image.
