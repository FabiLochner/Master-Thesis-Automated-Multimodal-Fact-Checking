## Elaboration
The claim is partially supported by the evidence. Multiple sources confirm that President Biden welcomed the freed Americans upon their arrival in the U.S. on August 1, 2024. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Biden boarded an empty plane after the freed Americans exited. The Times of India article mentions Biden remained on the plane for about two minutes to thank the flight crew, but it does not specify if the plane was empty. Therefore, the claim is partially verified.


## Final Judgement
The claim is partially supported by the evidence. Multiple sources confirm that President Biden welcomed the freed Americans upon their arrival in the U.S. on August 1, 2024. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Biden boarded an empty plane after the freed Americans exited. The Times of India article mentions Biden remained on the plane for about two minutes to thank the flight crew, but it does not specify if the plane was empty.
