Useful result: From [Source](https://www.voanews.com/a/fact-check-no-zelenskyy-did-not-say-american-sons-and-daughters-will-have-to-die-in-ukraine/6986873.html): 
Content: The Voice of America (VOA) published an article on March 2, 2023, stating that Zelenskyy did not say American sons and daughters would have to die in Ukraine. The article references a tweet from Monica Crowley, a former U.S. assistant secretary of the treasury, who claimed Zelenskyy was threatening the U.S. by saying American sons and daughters would have to fight and die for Ukraine. The VOA article clarifies that the claim is false and that the statement was taken out of context from a press conference on February 24, 2023, where Zelenskyy discussed a hypothetical situation if Ukraine lost the war. <image:8505>

Content: CNN published an article on March 2, 2023, fact-checking a viral video of Zelenskyy. The article states that Zelenskyy did not say that American sons and daughters will have to fight in Ukraine or die for Ukraine. <image:8507> The article explains that Zelenskyy predicted that if Ukraine loses the war, the U.S. would have to send troops to defend NATO member countries in the Baltics.

Useful result: From [Source](https://people.com/politics/ukraines-president-zelenskyy-wants-his-children-to-know-about-the-invasion/): 
Content: The article from People, published on March 21, 2022, reports that Volodymyr Zelenskyy wants his children to understand the sacrifices Ukrainians are making in the war. Zelenskyy stated that his children are aware of the war and that he does not shield them from seeing videos of the conflict. The article does not mention any statements about the U.S. sending their sons and daughters to die for Ukraine.

The claim 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the U.S. will have 'to send their sons and daughters' to die for Ukraine after having a heated exchange with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House in February 2025.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While a meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy occurred in February 2025, there is no evidence to support the statement attributed to Zelenskyy. Fact-checks from sources like Voice of America ([https://www.voanews.com/a/fact-check-no-zelenskyy-did-not-say-american-sons-and-daughters-will-have-to-die-in-ukraine/6986873.html](https://www.voanews.com/a/fact-check-no-zelenskyy-did-not-say-american-sons-and-daughters-will-have-to-die-in-ukraine/6986873.html)) and CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/02/politics/fact-check-zelensky-americans-fighting-ukraine-video](https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/02/politics/fact-check-zelensky-americans-fighting-ukraine-video)) debunked similar claims.
