## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/14/politics/jd-vance-us-troops-russia-ukraine-intl-hnk): 
Content: CNN reports that US Vice President J.D. Vance said the US could use economic and military "tools of leverage" against Russia if they don't negotiate a peace deal with Ukraine in good faith. The interview with the Wall Street Journal was published on February 14, 2025. ![image 1](media/0.jpg), ![image 2](media/3.jpg). The article was written by Jessie Yeung.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that J.D. Vance, the US Vice President, was interviewed by the Wall Street Journal, and the interview was published on February 14, 2025. The evidence also states that Vance mentioned the US could use military "tools of leverage" against Russia.

The claim is partially correct. While Vance did not explicitly state that the US military action is available against Russia, he did mention the use of military "tools of leverage".


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that J.D. Vance was interviewed by the Wall Street Journal on February 14, 2025, and that he discussed the use of military "tools of leverage" against Russia. However, the claim states that Vance said the US military action is available against Russia, which is not exactly what he said.

`false`
