Content: The Euronews article, published on January 15, 2025, debunks a claim circulating on social media that lists US politicians who allegedly received bribes from Ukraine. The article states that the image, which includes Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi, and Mitt Romney, is false and lacks evidence. It notes that no legitimate news outlets have reported on the claims, and the claims have been debunked by other fact-checkers. The article also mentions that the claims originate from at least 2023 and are part of a disinformation campaign. <image:18>
