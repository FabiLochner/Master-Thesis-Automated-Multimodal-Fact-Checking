Detector Media ([https://disinfo.detector.media/en/post/blackrock-allegedly-owns-47-of-ukraines-territory-and-has-banned-ukraine-from-burying-its-military](https://disinfo.detector.media/en/post/blackrock-allegedly-owns-47-of-ukraines-territory-and-has-banned-ukraine-from-burying-its-military)) states that the claim is false, and that the agreement with BlackRock and JPMorgan did not include restrictions on burying the military.


## Elaboration
The claim is false. Multiple sources, including The Asia Fact Check Lab ([https://www.rfa.org/english/news/afcl/afcl-blackrock-ukraine-land-08262024030948.html](https://www.rfa.org/english/news/afcl/afcl-blackrock-ukraine-land-08262024030948.html)) and Mythdetector.com ([https://mythdetector.com/en/ukrainian-lands-and-banned-the-burial-of-military-personnel/](https://mythdetector.com/en/ukrainian-lands-and-banned-the-burial-of-military-personnel/)), debunk the claim, citing its origins in Russian propaganda and satirical sources.

Furthermore, BlackRock does not own land in Ukraine. The agreement with BlackRock and JPMorgan did not include restrictions on burying the military, according to Detector Media ([https://disinfo.detector.media/en/post/blackrock-allegedly-owns-47-of-ukraines-territory-and-has-banned-ukraine-from-burying-its-military](https://disinfo.detector.media/en/post/blackrock-allegedly-owns-47-of-ukraines-territory-and-has-banned-ukraine-from-burying-its-military)).


## Final Judgement
The claim is demonstrably false. Multiple fact-checking sources confirm that the claim is false, originating from propaganda and satirical sources. BlackRock does not own land in Ukraine, and the agreement with BlackRock and JPMorgan did not include restrictions on burying the military.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim that BlackRock has asked that Ukrainian soldiers not be buried on land it owns in Ukraine is false. Fact-checks by The Asia Fact Check Lab ([https://www.rfa.org/english/news/afcl/afcl-blackrock-ukraine-land-08262024030948.html](https://www.rfa.org/english/news/afcl/afcl-blackrock-ukraine-land-08262024030948.html)) and Mythdetector.com ([https://mythdetector.com/en/ukrainian-lands-and-banned-the-burial-of-military-personnel/](https://mythdetector.com/en/ukrainian-lands-and-banned-the-burial-of-military-personnel/)) show the claim originates from Russian propaganda and satirical sources. Additionally, BlackRock does not own land in Ukraine, and the agreement with BlackRock and JPMorgan did not include such restrictions, as stated by Detector Media ([https://disinfo.detector.media/en/post/blackrock-allegedly-owns-47-of-ukraines-territory-and-has-banned-ukraine-from-burying-its-military](https://disinfo.detector.media/en/post/blackrock-allegedly-owns-47-of-ukraines-territory-and-has-banned-ukraine-from-burying-its-military)).
