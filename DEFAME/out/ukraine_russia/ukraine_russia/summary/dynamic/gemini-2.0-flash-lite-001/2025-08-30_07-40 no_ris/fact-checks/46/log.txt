In fact, sources like StopFake.org ([https://www.stopfake.org/en/fake-israeli-prime-minister-netanyahu-proposed-to-resettle-gaza-residents-to-ukraine-and-syria/](https://www.stopfake.org/en/fake-israeli-prime-minister-netanyahu-proposed-to-resettle-gaza-residents-to-ukraine-and-syria/)) explicitly debunk the claim, and CNN reports that Netanyahu was in talks with other countries, but not Ukraine or Syria, regarding the resettlement of displaced Palestinians.
