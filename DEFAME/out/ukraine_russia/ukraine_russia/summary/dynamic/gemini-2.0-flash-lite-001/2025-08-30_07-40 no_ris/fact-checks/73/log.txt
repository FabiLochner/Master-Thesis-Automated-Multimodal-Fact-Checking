Useful result: From [Source](https://voxukraine.org/en/photofake-a-photo-of-a-destroyed-ukrainian-air-force-base-after-a-bombardment-by-russian-iskanders): 
Content: The search result from VoxUkraine, published on June 5, 2025, discusses a photo of a destroyed Ukrainian Air Force base after a bombardment. The article states that the image is a photo fake, generated by AI. The image shows destroyed F-16 aircraft. <image:7930>, <image:7931>, <image:7932>. The article notes that the wreckage is scattered chaotically and does not match the trajectory of a real explosion.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd0532n9pdko): 
Content: The BBC reports that a Ukrainian F-16 fighter jet was destroyed during a Russian missile attack, killing the pilot, Oleksiy Mes. The article states that the cause of the crash was not a direct result of an enemy missile strike. <image:7940>, <image:7941>. The article was published on August 29, 2024.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.newsweek.com/ukraine-loses-another-f-16-fighter-jet-2073083): 
Content: Newsweek reports on the loss of another Ukrainian F-16 fighter jet, the third known loss during the war with Russia. The pilot ejected during a mission to repel a Russian attack. The article mentions previous F-16 losses, including one in April where a pilot was killed and another in August where a pilot was killed while responding to a Russian missile attack. The article also includes an image of an F-16 in flight <image:7942>. The article was published on February 17, 2025.

The claim '<image:22> This image shows a Ukrainian F-16 fighter jet which was shot down by Russia as part of the large-scale Russian invasion in Ukraine.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not supported by the evidence. While Ukrainian F-16s have crashed, including one destroyed in a Russian missile attack, the provided evidence does not confirm that the image depicts an F-16 shot down by Russia. Furthermore, a source indicates that images of destroyed F-16s may be AI-generated photo fakes.

So, the overall veracity is: false
