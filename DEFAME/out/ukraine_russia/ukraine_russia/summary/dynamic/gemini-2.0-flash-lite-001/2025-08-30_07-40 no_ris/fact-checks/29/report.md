## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
On February 28, 2025, Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with Donald Trump in the Oval Office at the White House, according to a Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Trump%E2%80%93Zelenskyy_Oval_Office_meeting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Trump%E2%80%93Zelenskyy_Oval_Office_meeting)) <image:i>. CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-zelensky-news-02-28-25](https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-zelensky-news-02-28-25)) <image:k> and NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5313079/trump-zelenskyy-meeting](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5313079/trump-zelenskyy-meeting)) ![image 7543](media/2025-08-30_07-49-1756540169-777868.jpg), ![image 7542](media/2025-08-30_07-49-1756540167-820444.jpg) also reported on the meeting.

The CNN article does not mention any meetings between Zelenskyy and Democrats on that date. The NPR article mentions criticism from top Democratic lawmakers following the meeting.


### Evidence from `web_search`
On February 28, 2025, Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with a bipartisan group of senators before meeting with Donald Trump, according to an ABC News article published on March 1, 2025 (![image 7547](media/2025-08-30_07-49-1756540199-689015.jpg)). The Guardian also reported on the meeting between Zelenskyy and Trump on February 28, 2025, mentioning that Democratic senators defended Zelenskyy after the meeting and that a bipartisan group of senators met with Zelenskyy earlier in the morning before his meeting with Trump (![image 7617](media/2025-08-30_07-51-1756540297-463000.jpg), ![image 7618](media/2025-08-30_07-51-1756540298-788811.jpg)).
