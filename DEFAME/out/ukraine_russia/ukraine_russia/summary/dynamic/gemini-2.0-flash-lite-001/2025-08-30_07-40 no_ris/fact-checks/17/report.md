The Myth Detector fact-checks the claim that Volodymyr Zelenskyy purchased an 88 million euro hotel in Courchevel, France, and states that the claim is false, originating from anonymous Russian-language accounts. The hotel was purchased in 2023 by the Monegasque company Société des Bains de Mer (SBM) (![image 1861](media/2025-08-07_19-11-1754593914-756508.jpg), ![image 1862](media/2025-08-07_19-12-1754593941-308493.jpg)). Ukrinform.net reports that Russian media falsely claimed Zelenskyy purchased the Palace des Neiges hotel in Courchevel, France, for 88 million euros, as part of a disinformation campaign (![image 1868](media/2025-08-07_19-12-1754593974-239582.jpg), ![image 1870](media/2025-08-07_19-12-1754593976-768408.jpg), ![image 1873](media/2025-08-07_19-13-1754593980-370998.jpg)).
