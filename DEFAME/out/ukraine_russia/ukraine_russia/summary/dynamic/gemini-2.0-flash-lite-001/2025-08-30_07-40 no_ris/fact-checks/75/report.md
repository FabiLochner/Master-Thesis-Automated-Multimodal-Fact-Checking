## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results show images of military uniforms with American flag patches. One source is from Propper.com ([https://www.propper.com/usa-flag-reverse-patch.html?srsltid=AfmBOorJ3UHj6L4BpI95XqS1JAAVhpcWWUjJn7MHD-hrklJBnOBI3QkY](https://www.propper.com/usa-flag-reverse-patch.html?srsltid=AfmBOorJ3UHj6L4BpI95XqS1JAAVhpcWWUjJn7MHD-hrklJBnOBI3QkY)) ![image 7974](media/2025-08-30_08-08-1756541282-739700.jpg), another from ASATechMed.com ([https://www.asatechmed.com/products/6-pc-assorted-usa-tactical-american-flag-patch-100-embroidered-thin-blue-line-united-states-military-morale-patches-set-for-molle-hats-backpacks-tactical-vest-uniforms?srsltid=AfmBOoqqQhYoDLaozpFU-vQARkuTRc6niYIiolLlTJ4oZHFSWXGdy5gj](https://www.asatechmed.com/products/6-pc-assorted-usa-tactical-american-flag-patch-100-embroidered-thin-blue-line-united-states-military-morale-patches-set-for-molle-hats-backpacks-tactical-vest-uniforms?srsltid=AfmBOoqqQhYoDLaozpFU-vQARkuTRc6niYIiolLlTJ4oZHFSWXGdy5gj)) ![image 7975](media/2025-08-30_08-08-1756541283-031931.jpg), and another from starsnstripesco.com ([https://starsnstripesco.com/products/copy-of-u-s-army-regulation-flag-patch-ocp?srsltid=AfmBOorwpsdqH384pCL2u5vMgxq1PX5LQ-OCfijEFPVMv9Es5XotIbIE](https://starsnstripesco.com/products/copy-of-u-s-army-regulation-flag-patch-ocp?srsltid=AfmBOorwpsdqH384pCL2u5vMgxq1PX5LQ-OCfijEFPVMv9Es5XotIbIE)) ![image 7976](media/2025-08-30_08-08-1756541283-292974.jpg).


## Elaboration
The presence of an American flag patch on a military uniform, as seen in the image, does not automatically confirm the presence of American mercenaries. The search results show that American flag patches are available for purchase and can be worn on military uniforms. The claim requires further evidence to confirm the individuals are mercenaries.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that while there was a Ukrainian incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024, there is no evidence to support the claim that American mercenaries participated in it. The image shows individuals with American flag patches on their uniforms, but this does not confirm they are mercenaries.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is unsupported. While there was a Ukrainian incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024, as documented by sources like Al Jazeera and the Institute for the Study of War ([https://understandingwar.org/backgrounder/ukraine%E2%80%99s-kursk-incursion-six-month-assessment](https://understandingwar.org/backgrounder/ukraine%E2%80%99s-kursk-incursion-six-month-assessment)), there is no evidence to suggest the involvement of American mercenaries. The presence of American flag patches on uniforms, as shown in the image, does not confirm the individuals are mercenaries, as such patches are commercially available.
