## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The image (![image 3](media/4.jpg)) in the claim is misleading and has been digitally altered. The original image is from a 2006 BBC article. The claim about 18 British Special Forces members killed in the Odessa Region in Ukraine is false, according to a fact-check from [NewsMobile](https://www.newsmobile.in/nm-fact-checker/fact-check-video-show-18-british-special-forces-members-killed-in-ukraine-find-truth-here/). The claim was also debunked by the Southern Defense Forces spokesperson Dmytro Pletenchuk, who stated that the journalist provided no evidence for her claims, as reported by [UA Wire](https://www.uawire.org/false-allegations-of-british-sas-casualties-in-odesa-dutch-journalist-s-controversial-claims-debunked-by-ukrainian-military). The Odessa region is mentioned as one of the oblasts where civilian casualties were reported in November 2024, according to [AOAV.org.uk](https://aoav.org.uk/2024/explosive-violence-in-november-2024/).
