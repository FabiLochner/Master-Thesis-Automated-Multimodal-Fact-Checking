Useful result: From [Source](https://www.yahoo.com/news/no-biden-didnt-hes-done-162918340.html): 
Content: The Yahoo News article, published on October 10, 2024, fact-checks the claim that Biden said no more aid would be given to Hurricane Helene victims. The article states that Biden did not say this and that he later said more aid would be forthcoming. The article references a White House transcript of Biden's remarks on September 30, 2024, where he said he would be asking Congress for a supplemental aid bill. The article also mentions an $8 billion military aid package for Ukraine announced on September 26, 2024. <image:7608>, <image:7616>

The claim 'In remarks to reporters on September 29, 2024 US President Joe Biden announced that no more aid would be provided for the areas affected by Hurrican Helene, but 2.4 billion US-$ more for Ukraine.' is false.
Justification: Based on the fact-check, the claim is false. President Biden did not announce a halt to aid for Hurricane Helene victims; instead, he stated that more aid would be provided and requested a supplemental aid bill. While an $8 billion military aid package for Ukraine was announced on September 26, 2024, this does not support the specific details of the claim. The [Yahoo News article](https://www.yahoo.com/news/no-biden-didnt-hes-done-162918340.html) confirms this.

So, the overall veracity is: false
