## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The provided sources describe a contentious meeting between Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trump at the White House on February 28, 2025. According to a Wikipedia article, the meeting involved Donald Trump, JD Vance, and Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The meeting ended abruptly after an "Oval Office spat," as reported by NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5312076/zelenskyys-visit-to-the-white-house-ends-abruptly-after-oval-office-spat](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5312076/zelenskyys-visit-to-the-white-house-ends-abruptly-after-oval-office-spat)).

Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/28/key-takeaways-from-the-fiery-white-house-meeting-with-trump-and-zelenskyy](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/28/key-takeaways-from-the-fiery-white-house-meeting-with-trump-and-zelenskyy)) also covered the meeting, highlighting disagreements over a deal for Ukraine's rare earth minerals and security assurances. However, none of the sources mention Zelenskyy stating that the U.S. would have to send their sons and daughters to die for Ukraine.


### Evidence from `web_search`
Fact-checkers from Yahoo News ([Source](https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-zelenskyy-saying-us-120000537.html)) and CNN ([Source](https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/02/politics/fact-check-zelensky-americans-fighting-ukraine-video)) state that Zelenskyy did not say the U.S. would have to send their sons and daughters to die for Ukraine. VOA News also published an article with the same conclusion ([Source](https://www.voanews.com/a/no-zelenskyy-did-not-say-american-sons-and-daughters-will-have-to-die-in-ukraine/6993247.html)).

The remarks were made two years before the alleged February 2025 White House visit. Zelenskyy was discussing a hypothetical scenario where the loss of Ukraine could lead to a broader conflict involving the U.S. ![image 1](media/0.jpg), <image:k>, ![image 522](media/2025-08-06_17-47-1754502436-263202.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Zelenskyy did not make the statement attributed to him. Fact-checkers from Yahoo News, CNN, and VOA News have debunked the claim that Zelenskyy said the U.S. would have to send their sons and daughters to die for Ukraine.

The evidence also shows that Zelenskyy made similar remarks two years before the alleged White House meeting, but not in the context described in the claim. The sources covering the February 2025 meeting do not mention the statement.

Therefore, the claim is false.


## Final Judgement
The claim that Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the U.S. would have to send their sons and daughters to die for Ukraine after a heated exchange with Donald Trump at the White House in February 2025 is false. Fact-checkers have debunked this statement, and the sources covering the White House meeting do not mention it.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While there was a contentious meeting between Zelenskyy and Trump in February 2025, as reported by NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5312076/zelenskyys-visit-to-the-white-house-ends-abruptly-after-oval-office-spat](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5312076/zelenskyys-visit-to-the-white-house-ends-abruptly-after-oval-office-spat)) and Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/28/key-takeaways-from-the-fiery-white-house-meeting-with-trump-and-zelenskyy](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/28/key-takeaways-from-the-fiery-white-house-meeting-with-trump-and-zelenskyy)), Zelenskyy did not make the statement attributed to him. Fact-checkers from Yahoo News, CNN, and VOA News have debunked the claim.
