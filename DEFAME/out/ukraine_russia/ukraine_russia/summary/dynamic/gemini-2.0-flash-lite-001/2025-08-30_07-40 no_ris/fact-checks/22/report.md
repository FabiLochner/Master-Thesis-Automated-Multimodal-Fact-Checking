### Evidence from `image_search`
The Institute for the Study of War published a map of the Ukrainian incursion into Kursk Oblast as of August 10, 2024, which indicates the Ukrainian forces advanced west of Semenovka.

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the image could have been taken in Ukraine or Russia, as the geolocation data indicates. The image search results confirm that there was an incursion by Ukrainian forces into the Kursk region in August 2024. However, the evidence does not provide any information about the use of chemical weapons by the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the Kursk offensive. The web search results mention the use of chemical weapons by Russia in Ukraine.

Therefore, the claim that the image shows a chemical attack by the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the Kursk offensive in August 2024 is not supported by the evidence. More information is needed to verify the claim.

## Evidence

### Evidence from `image_search`
The Guardian published an article on March 27, 2024, about the war in Ukraine, including an image of an explosion (![image 7490](media/2025-08-30_07-46-1756540017-203770.jpg)). The New York Times published an article on May 2, 2024, about the use of chemical weapons in Ukraine (![image 7491](media/2025-08-30_07-46-1756540017-538849.jpg)).


## Elaboration
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs alleges that Ukrainian forces used chemical weapons in the Kursk region on August 10, 2024, specifically mentioning an attack in Sudzha. Newsweek reported that the acting governor of the Kursk Oblast accused Ukraine of using chemical weapons during the incursion. The U.S. Department of State has accused Russia of using chloropicrin against Ukrainian troops. While the evidence includes claims of chemical weapon use, it is important to note that these claims come from the Russian government and should be considered with caution.


## Final Judgement
The initial search did not provide enough information to verify the claim. However, subsequent searches revealed conflicting claims. The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the acting governor of the Kursk Oblast accused Ukraine of using chemical weapons during the incursion into the Kursk region in August 2024. The U.S. Department of State accused Russia of using chloropicrin against Ukrainian troops.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is disputed. While the image's geolocation is uncertain, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the acting governor of the Kursk Oblast accused Ukraine of using chemical weapons during the incursion into the Kursk region in August 2024, as reported by the Russian Federation's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Newsweek. However, the U.S. Department of State has accused Russia of using chloropicrin against Ukrainian troops.
