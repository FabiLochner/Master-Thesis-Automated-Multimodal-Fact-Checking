## Elaboration
The evidence shows that Vladimir Putin has been the subject of rumors and speculation regarding his health and potential death. However, there is no verifiable evidence to support the claim that Putin has died in an explosion. Official statements and recent publications attributed to Putin are available, which further contradicts the claim.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that while there was an incident involving a limousine from Vladimir Putin's fleet, there is no evidence to support the claim that he died in an explosion. Furthermore, there are ongoing speculations about Putin's health, but no verifiable information confirms his death. Official statements and recent publications attributed to Putin are available, which contradicts the claim.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE
