Useful result: From [Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-64975766): 
Content: The BBC News published an article about a Russian fighter jet and a US drone incident over the Black Sea. <image:7422>

The claim '<image:5> This image shows a US F-16 fighter jet which was shot down in August 2024 in airspace over the Black Sea after refusing to obey Russian orders.' is false.
Justification: The evidence indicates that Ukrainian F-16s have been involved in the conflict, with at least one crashing in August 2024, as reported by [Defense News](https://www.defense.news/). However, the claim that the image depicts a US F-16 shot down over the Black Sea after refusing Russian orders is not supported by the evidence, which focuses on Ukrainian F-16s and does not identify the origin of the aircraft in the image.

So, the overall veracity is: false
