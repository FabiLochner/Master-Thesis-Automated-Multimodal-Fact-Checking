# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that Claudia Sheinbaum rejected an invitation to visit Ukraine. However, the evidence does not contain any information about the alleged quote attributed to her.

Therefore, the veracity of the claim is uncertain due to the lack of evidence supporting the second part of the claim.

_________________________



JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====

The claim can be considered plausible, as the evidence suggests that Trump could have suspended aid, and Wałęsa wrote a letter criticizing Trump's actions. However, the content of the letter is still unknown.

To fully verify the claim, the content of the letter needs to be examined.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that peace talks between Russia and Ukraine took place in Istanbul on June 2, 2025. However, the evidence does not explicitly state whether a peace deal was reached in early 2025.

The CNN article ([https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/02/europe/russia-ukraine-peace-talks-turkey-drone-attack-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/02/europe/russia-ukraine-peace-talks-turkey-drone-attack-intl)) mentions peace talks, but it does not confirm a deal. The Atlantic Council discusses a potential "Putin-friendly peace deal" ([https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/a-putin-friendly-peace-deal-would-be-disastrous-for-global-security/](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/a-putin-friendly-peace-deal-would-be-disastrous-for-global-security/)), implying that a deal was not yet finalized.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence. The evidence only confirms peace talks, not a finalized deal in early 2025.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that peace talks between Russia and Ukraine took place in Istanbul on June 2, 2025. However, the evidence does not explicitly state whether a peace deal was reached in early 2025.

The CNN article ([https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/02/europe/russia-ukraine-peace-talks-turkey-drone-attack-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/02/europe/russia-ukraine-peace-talks-turkey-drone-attack-intl)) mentions peace talks, but it does not confirm a deal.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that Kamala Harris has spoken about Ukraine and Russia. However, the provided evidence does not contain the exact quote attributed to her in the claim.

To verify the claim, I would need to find a transcript or recording of a speech by Kamala Harris where she made the statement.

_________________________



JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

The sources are: [https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/kamala-harris-ukraine-us-truly-committed-ukrainian-victory](https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/kamala-harris-ukraine-us-truly-committed-ukrainian-victory) and [https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/06/15/nation/kamala-harris-ukraine-summit/](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/06/15/nation/kamala-harris-ukraine-summit/).


## Elaboration
The new evidence continues to show Kamala Harris's involvement in discussions and events related to Ukraine. However, it still does not provide the specific quote from the claim.

To verify the claim, I would need to find a transcript or recording of a speech by Kamala Harris where she made the statement.

### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/02/us/politics/biden-greeting-freed-prisoners.html): 
Content: The New York Times published an article on August 2, 2024, about Joe Biden greeting freed prisoners. The article includes an image of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris on the tarmac as a person exits the plane. <image:6819>


# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence shows that on August 2, 2024, Joe Biden greeted a person exiting a plane. The image suggests that the plane was not empty when Biden approached it.

The claim states that Biden boarded an empty plane after the freed Americans exited. The evidence does not support this.

* information that might be useful for the fact-check (see Record)
* relevant images (refer to images by inserting their reference <image:k>)
* if available: the release date as well as the author or the publisher (e.g. the media company) of the search result.

Do NOT include:
* advertisements
* any other information not related to the Record or the Claim

Additional rules:
* Do not add any additional information besides the information in the Search Result.
* If the Search Result doesn't contain any relevant information for the fact-checking work, simply print one word in capital letters: "NONE".
* Keep your writing style like in the Examples 1, 2 and 3 provided to you.

NONE

# Example 3
The Guardian discusses a report blaming the Syrian government for a toxic gas attack and condemning their use of chemical weapons. The Guardian mentions the Chemical Weapons Convention and the responsibilities of Syria under the convention. According to The Guardian, The White House condemned the Assad regime for defying the norm against chemical weapons use.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's statement in an AP news interview from February 1, 2025 that his country's military has received only a portion of the more than 175 billion in U.S. aid confirms that the US aid is a money laundering operation."

## Actions

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence contradicts the claim. Le Monde reported that Biden pledged aid to Hurricane Helene victims. The claim states that Biden announced no more aid for the affected areas.

_________________________



JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

The BBC News website ([Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgl2370ldxro)) includes an image of Benjamin Netanyahu pointing at a map of the Gaza Strip <image:6866>.

Le Monde ([Source](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2024/10/28/benjamin-netanyahu-s-new-war-against-northern-gaza-strip_6730858_4.html)) features an image of destruction in Gaza <image:6867>.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Benjamin Netanyahu visited the White House. However, the search results do not contain any information about Netanyahu announcing plans to resettle Palestinians in Gaza to Ukraine and Syria during his visit.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence. More information is needed to verify the claim.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
Euronews published a fact-check stating that Scholz did not call for a German state of emergency over Russia-US peace talks, with the article published on February 19, 2025 (<image:6414>). Reuters published an article on February 15, 2025, about German Chancellor Olaf Scholz (<image:6415>).

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence includes a fact-check from Euronews, published on February 19, 2025, which states that Scholz did not declare a state of emergency in Germany over Russia-US peace talks. This directly contradicts the claim. The other search results provide images of Scholz and Trump, but do not provide any information to support the claim.

Therefore, based on the available evidence, the claim is false.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

FSWC Calls for Canadians to Stand with Israel

### News Release

‍

**Statement from FSWC**

**Toronto (October 7, 2023)** - Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center (FSWC) is devastated by today’s horrific news from Israel concerning the many Israelis killed or wounded in the murderous, multi-front assault by Hamas terrorists.

We extend our condolences and deepest sympathies to the families of those killed in this abhorrent, unprovoked attack on civilians. We express our wishes for a full and speedy recovery to those wounded and pray for the safe return of all those kidnapped and taken to Gaza as hostages by the Hamas invaders.

We condemn, in the harshest terms, the actions of Palestinian terror groups in firing thousands of rockets indiscriminately at civilian targets in Israel and massacring residents in numerous villages and towns, actions that constitute heinous war crimes that shouldn’t go unpunished.

FSWC thanks senior police officials in Toronto, York and Peel regions after they informed us that they have devoted additional resources to ensure the safety and security of Jewish residents and Jewish community institutions given the antisemitic attacks that took place two years ago in Toronto during the last major conflict between Israel and Palestinian terror groups in Gaza.

**FSWC President and CEO Michael Levitt issued the following statement:**

“We appreciate the strong support for Israel already expressed by leaders in our country, including the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and many others at all levels of government and many community organizations. We call on all Canadians to stand in solidarity with Israel, to unequivocally condemn today’s appalling attacks against Israelis and to speak out against the actions of the Palestinian terrorists and those who support them, including their backers in Iran.”

## Elaboration
The evidence includes images of John Thune and Adam Schiff. However, the provided sources do not contain any information about John Thune blocking Adam Schiff's committee assignments. Therefore, I cannot verify the claim.

I still need more information to verify the claim, such as:
*   Statements from John Thune regarding Adam Schiff's committee assignments.
*   News articles or reports detailing the reasons behind any blocking of committee assignments.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

Some open-source estimates suggest that Ukraine had already lost nearly 40 Leopards, but those estimates are unconfirmed so far, according to the report. Russia repeatedly stated that arms supplies to Ukraine hinder the settlement and directly involve NATO countries in the conflict. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that the United States and NATO were directly involved in the conflict not only by providing weapons but also by training Ukrainian personnel in European countries.

Ukrainian Armed Forces destroyed in the Zaporozhye direction. Russian Defence Ministry / TASS

Moscow said Tuesday that it had captured several German Leopard tanks and U.S. Bradley infantry fighting vehicles, releasing footage showing Russian troops surveying the equipment supplied to Ukraine by Western countries.

"Leopard tanks and Bradley infantry fighting vehicles. These are our trophies. Equipment of the Ukrainian armed forces in the Zaporizhzhia region," the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement.

"Servicemen of the Vostok group inspect enemy tanks and infantry fighting vehicles captured in battle."

Kyiv has appealed to its allies in the West to deliver a broad range of modern military equipment to help Ukrainian forces recapture large swathes of territory controlled by Russian forces.

The Defense Ministry said several of the captured vehicles had working engines, suggesting that the battles they were involved in had been short and that Ukrainian troops had "fled" their offensive positions.

**(DEFENCE SECURITY ASIA) — During the week of May 11 to 17, Russian military claimed to have successfully destroyed five Leopard 2A1 tanks, manufactured by the German company Krauss-Maffei but donated to the Ukrainian Armed Forces to help the Eastern Europe country in its armed conflict with Russia.**

**In addition to the Leopard tanks, the Russian Ministry of Defense also alleged that 13 armored vehicles, 55 various vehicles, “Grad” multiple rocket launcher systems, and 47 artillery units—22 of which were supplied by foreign countries—were destroyed during this period.**

**Moreover, four Mi-24 helicopters and 40 unmanned boats belonging to the Ukrainian military were reportedly destroyed by Russia in the same timeframe.**

**Among the foreign-supplied armored vehicles to Ukraine, the Leopard tanks have been the most frequently supplied to Kyiv compared to other models such as the American-made Abrams and the British-made Challengers.**

**Since last year, countries such as Germany and several other European nations have supplied between 100-200 Leopard tanks to Ukraine for use in a spring counteroffensive against Russian positions.**

**“Russian Soldiers Pose in Front of Captured Leopard 2A6 Tank”**

**Line of Leopard tanks and Bradley armoured infantry fighting vehicle were destroyed in Zaphorizia, southern Ukraine.**

**Although the Ukrainian counteroffensive in 2023 initially started well, it faced increasingly formidable opposition from Russian forces who began altering their tactics and strategies.**

**These changes in strategy and tactics by the Russian forces led to the destruction of many of the Ukrainian tanks that had been supplied by donor countries like Germany, other European nations, the United States, and Britain.**

**However, to date, no one knows exactly how many Leopard tanks have been destroyed by Russia.**

**Nevertheless, Russian President Vladimir Putin has reportedly stated to his country’s war correspondents that Ukraine has lost more than 160 tanks supplied by foreign countries.**

**Given the high volume of Leopard tanks supplied to Ukraine, it is logical to conclude that many of the tanks destroyed by Russia were Leopard models.**

**Regarding the Abrams tanks, the Russian military stated that of the 31 American-made tanks supplied to Ukraine, more than five of the tanks have been destroyed by Russian forces.**

**A charred M1A1 Abrams main battle tank being transported to Moscow to participate in an exhibition at Victory Park.**

 **As a result of the destruction of five Abrams tanks, the United States has reportedly “withdrawn” these tanks from the Ukrainian battlefield, likely in an effort to “preserve its reputation.”**

**Following the destruction experienced by Leopard tanks supplied by Germany and other European countries, Ukraine’s Deputy Foreign Minister Andii Melnyk has requested that Kiev be supplied with more Leopard tanks, including the latest variant, the Leopard 2A6.**

 **However, the newest Leopard 2A6 variant supplied to Ukraine has met the same fate.**

**The Russian military reported capturing the most powerful tank in the Ukrainian arsenal, the German-made Leopard 2A6, after intense fighting in Avdiivka, Ukraine, last April.**

**It is believed that Ukraine possesses 21 Leopard 2A6 tanks, with 18 of these tanks developed by the companies Krauss-Maffei Wegmann and Rheinmetall being donated by Germany, while the remainder were provided by Portugal.**

**However, most of these Leopard 2A6 tanks donated to the Ukrainian military could not be used after failing to be properly maintained and remained inoperable as claimed by a senior German politician last January.**

**An Abrams tank caught fire after being struck by a Lancet kamikaze drone and an RPG from Russian forces.**

**According to Russian military sources, after capturing and removing the tank from the combat area, Russian forces transported the tank and sent it to Moscow, possibly for research purposes.**

**The Leopard 2A6 was successfully captured after a Russian platoon executed an ambush that caused the Ukrainian tank crew to abandon the German-made vehicle.**

**The Leopard 2A6 represents an upgrade from the Leopard 2A5, incorporating enhanced armor protection, firepower, and electronic warfare capabilities.**

**The tank measures 9.97 meters in length and weighs 62.3 tons, making it one of the heaviest main battle tanks ever deployed, with an engine power of 1,500 horsepower.**

**Capable of speeds up to 75 km/h and with an operational range of 500 km, it is equipped with a Rheinmetall 120 mm L/55 cannon, allowing it to fire all standard NATO ammunition types, including APFSDS, HEAT, and multi-purpose shells.**

**The Leopard 2A6 also features dual 7.62 mm MG3A1 machine guns and an advanced fire control system including a laser rangefinder, thermal imaging, and a ballistic computer. — DSA**

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that the image depicts destroyed tanks and is related to the Russia-Ukraine war. However, the provided articles do not explicitly confirm the claim that the image shows destroyed Ukrainian tanks during Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024. The reverse image search results mention destroyed tanks but do not specify the location or date. The image search results mention the Kursk region and the date August 2024, but the provided images do not match the original image.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the available evidence. Additional information is needed to confirm the specific context of the image, including the location and the date.

## Elaboration
The additional evidence confirms that images of destroyed tanks are associated with the Russia-Ukraine war. However, none of the provided sources specifically mention the Kursk Oblast, August 2024, or Ukrainian incursions. Therefore, the claim remains unverified due to a lack of specific supporting evidence.


## Actions
```
image_search("destroyed tanks Kursk Oblast August 2024")
```

## Evidence
No new evidence found.

## Elaboration
The claim remains unverified. While the image search results confirm the existence of destroyed tanks in the context of the Russia-Ukraine war, no evidence directly supports the claim that the image depicts destroyed Ukrainian tanks during an incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024. The search results did not yield any matching images or articles that confirm the specific details of the claim.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:26> This image shows destroyed Ukrainian tanks during Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:26>)
image_search("destroyed Ukrainian tanks Kursk Oblast August 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:26> appears in articles discussing destroyed tanks in the context of the Russia-Ukraine war. One article from Sputnik Africa, published on October 17, 2024, mentions Ukraine's loss of around 40 Leopard tanks since February 2022. Another article from The Moscow Times, published on June 13, 2023, states that Russia captured German Leopard tanks and U.S. Bradley infantry fighting vehicles in the Zaporizhzhia region. A Defence Security Asia article from May 19, 2024, discusses the destruction of German-made Leopard tanks in Ukraine.

The articles do not mention Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast or the date August 2024.


### Evidence from `image_search`
The Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA) published an article about the second battle of Kursk, which includes an image of a Ukrainian tank (<image:6630>). Al Jazeera published an article on August 16, 2024, about Russia's claims of eliminating a Ukrainian unit in Kursk, which includes an image of a tank (<image:6631>). NBC News published an article about the evacuation of Belgorod and Kursk, which includes an image of a tank (<image:6632>).

The articles can be found at the following URLs: [https://cepa.org/article/the-second-battle-of-kursk-an-omen-of-doom/](https://cepa.org/article/the-second-battle-of-kursk-an-omen-of-doom/), [https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/16/russia-says-it-eliminated-ukrainian-unit-as-kyiv-claims-advances-in-kursk](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/16/russia-says-it-eliminated-ukrainian-unit-as-kyiv-claims-advances-in-kursk), and [https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-evacuates-belgorod-kursk-incursion-fire-nuclear-plant-rcna166172](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-evacuates-belgorod-kursk-incursion-fire-nuclear-plant-rcna166172).


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the image depicts destroyed tanks and is related to the Russia-Ukraine war. However, the provided articles do not explicitly confirm the claim that the image shows destroyed Ukrainian tanks during Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024. The reverse image search results mention destroyed tanks but do not specify the location or date. The image search results mention the Kursk region and the date August 2024, but the provided images do not match the original image.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the available evidence. Additional information is needed to confirm the specific context of the image, including the location and the date.
