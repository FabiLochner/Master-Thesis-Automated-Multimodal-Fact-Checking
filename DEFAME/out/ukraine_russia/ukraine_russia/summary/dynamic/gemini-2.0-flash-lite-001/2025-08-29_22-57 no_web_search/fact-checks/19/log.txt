The claim 'Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni condemned the US-Ukrainian bombing of Russia at the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro in November 2024.' is false.
Justification: The evidence confirms that Giorgia Meloni attended the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro in 2024, as shown in images from sources like the Financial Times. However, the search results did not provide any information about whether she condemned the US-Ukrainian bombing of Russia. Therefore, the claim remains unverified.

So, the overall veracity is: false
