## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include images of Volodymyr Zelensky and Klaus Schwab at the World Economic Forum. One image from [UConn Today](https://today.uconn.edu/2023/02/one-year-after-the-russian-invasion-of-ukraine-can-businesses-prevent-future-wars/) shows Klaus Schwab with Volodymyr Zelensky on a screen ![image 6684](media/2025-08-29_23-01-1756508494-736152.jpg).

Another image from [Shutterstock](https://www.shutterstock.com/editorial/image-editorial/volodymyr-zelensky-president-ukraine-r-klaus-schwab-10532640et) shows a photograph of Volodymyr Zelensky and Klaus Schwab ![image 6685](media/2025-08-29_23-01-1756508494-959125.jpg). An image from [ecfr.eu](https://ecfr.eu/article/the-decline-and-fall-of-davos-man/) shows Volodymyr Zelensky at the World Economic Forum ![image 6686](media/2025-08-29_23-01-1756508495-235772.jpg).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Volodymyr Zelensky and Klaus Schwab have been at the World Economic Forum. The images from [UConn Today](https://today.uconn.edu/2023/02/one-year-after-the-russian-invasion-of-ukraine-can-businesses-prevent-future-wars/) and [ecfr.eu](https://ecfr.eu/article/the-decline-and-fall-of-davos-man/) show Zelensky at the forum. The image from [Shutterstock](https://www.shutterstock.com/editorial/image-editorial/volodymyr-zelensky-president-ukraine-r-klaus-schwab-10532640et) shows Zelensky and Schwab together.

The evidence does not explicitly state that the image in the claim was taken after the Russian invasion. However, the image from [ecfr.eu](https://ecfr.eu/article/the-decline-and-fall-of-davos-man/) shows Zelensky in a t-shirt, which is different from the image in the claim.

The claim is partially supported by the evidence. More information is needed to confirm the exact timing of the image in the claim.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image of Volodymyr Zelensky and Klaus Schwab at the World Economic Forum in Davos was taken on January 22, 2020, according to sources. The image is from the website of the President of Ukraine and is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International.

The image can be found on [en.m.wikipedia.org](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ukraine_President_Volodymyr_Zelenskyy_and_Klaus_Schwab_at_the_World_Economic_Forum_in_Davos,_22_January_2020.jpg), [scn.wikipedia.org](https://scn.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ukraine_President_Volodymyr_Zelenskyy_and_Klaus_Schwab_at_the_World_Economic_Forum_in_Davos,_22_January_2020.jpg), and [commons.wikimedia.org](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ukraine_President_Volodymyr_Zelenskyy_and_Klaus_Schwab_at_the_World_Economic_Forum_in_Davos,_22_January_2020.jpg). ![image 10](media/13.jpg)


## Elaboration
The image in the claim was taken on January 22, 2020, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, according to the reverse image search results. This predates the large-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, which began in February 2022. Therefore, the claim is false.


## Final Judgement
The image in the claim was taken on January 22, 2020, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, which predates the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Therefore, the claim that the image was taken after the invasion is false.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image depicts Volodymyr Zelensky and Klaus Schwab at the World Economic Forum. However, a reverse image search reveals that the photo was taken on January 22, 2020, well before the large-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, making the claim inaccurate. The image can be found on [en.m.wikipedia.org](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ukraine_President_Volodymyr_Zelenskyy_and_Klaus_Schwab_at_the_World_Economic_Forum_in_Davos,_22_January_2020.jpg).
