The claim '<image:26> This image shows destroyed Ukrainian tanks during Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is unverified. While the image depicts destroyed tanks and is related to the Russia-Ukraine war, there is no evidence to support the specific details of the claim, including the location (Kursk Oblast) and the date (August 2024). The search results did not yield any matching images or articles that confirm the claim.

So, the overall veracity is: false
