## Actions

reverse_search(![image 16](media/49.jpg))
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky signing ammunition at the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant (SCAAP) in Scranton, Pennsylvania, USA, on September 23, 2024 (![image 954](media/2025-08-06_18-18-1754504302-187821.jpg), ![image 960](media/2025-08-06_18-18-1754504308-548113.jpg), ![image 963](media/2025-08-06_18-18-1754504311-967303.jpg)). The BBC published an article on September 26, 2024, about Zelensky's meeting with Joe Biden at the White House, which included the image. The New York Post published an article on September 25, 2024, discussing Zelensky's visit to the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant, suggesting it was a partisan political event.

None of the sources mention that the ammunition was Israeli bombs intended for use against Palestinians in Gaza.


## Elaboration
The claim is false. The image shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky signing ammunition at the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant in Pennsylvania, USA, on September 23, 2024. The evidence does not support the claim that the ammunition was Israeli bombs intended for use against Palestinians in Gaza.


## Final Judgement
The image shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky signing ammunition at a US plant, not Israeli bombs. The claim misrepresents the context of the image.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image depicts Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky signing ammunition at the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant in the USA, as confirmed by reverse image searches and reports from sources like the BBC and New York Post. There is no evidence to support the claim that the ammunition was Israeli bombs intended for use against Palestinians in Gaza.
