## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Donald Trump was interviewed by Theo Von. However, the provided search results do not contain information about the content of the interview, specifically whether Trump criticized Keir Starmer over a deal between the U.K. and Ukraine.

The search results do show that there are articles discussing Donald Trump and Keir Starmer, but these articles are dated February 2025. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the current evidence.

To verify the claim, information about the interview's content is needed.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The Daily Progress, The Boston Globe, and Tucson.com published articles that include images of Donald Trump and Keir Starmer. The Boston Globe article discusses a meeting between Trump and a European leader regarding Ukraine, while the other sources do not provide specific details about the content of the meetings or interviews. The articles can be found here: [Source](https://dailyprogress.com/news/nation-world/article_87628c6d-c55d-5a79-9c3c-5ee5001dc716.html), [Source](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/08/17/world/european-leader-ukraine-trump-meeting/), and [Source](https://tucson.com/news/nation-world/government-politics/article_59807f85-88f9-56d4-a492-23ea493e77c6.html). Images of Trump and Starmer are included (![image 6925](media/2025-08-29_23-10-1756509054-065598.jpg), ![image 6926](media/2025-08-29_23-10-1756509054-856009.jpg), ![image 6927](media/2025-08-29_23-10-1756509055-086690.jpg)).


## Elaboration
The new evidence still does not provide information about the content of the Theo Von interview. While the search results show images of Trump and Starmer together, and articles discussing meetings between Trump and European leaders regarding Ukraine, there is no mention of Trump criticizing Starmer in the Theo Von interview.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.
