The claim 'After a call with Russia's President Vladimir Putin on February 12, 2025, US President Donald Trump announced that he had reached an agreement to end the war in Ukraine.' is false.
Justification: The claim is partially supported by the evidence. Multiple sources, including CNN and Reuters, confirm a phone call between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin on February 12, 2025. Al Jazeera and Bloomberg report that they agreed to begin talks to end the war in Ukraine. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Trump announced he had reached an agreement to end the war, making the claim partially inaccurate.

So, the overall veracity is: false
