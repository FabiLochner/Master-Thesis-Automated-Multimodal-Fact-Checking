## Elaboration
The image depicts a Russian MiG-29S Fulcrum, not a US F-16 fighter jet. The event occurred in 1993 during a British air show, not in August 2024 over the Black Sea. The pilot is ejecting from the aircraft, indicating a mid-air collision.


## Final Judgement
The claim is demonstrably false. The image shows a Russian MiG-29S Fulcrum, not a US F-16, and the event occurred in 1993, not in August 2024. The context of the image is misrepresented. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
