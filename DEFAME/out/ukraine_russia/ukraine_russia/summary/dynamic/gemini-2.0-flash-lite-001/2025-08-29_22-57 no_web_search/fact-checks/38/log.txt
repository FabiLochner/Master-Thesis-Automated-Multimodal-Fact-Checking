The claim 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy engaged in election interference by campaigning in Pennsylvania for Kamala Harris ahead of the US presidential election in 2024.' is false.
Justification: The evidence indicates that Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Kamala Harris have met, and Zelenskyy visited Scranton, Pennsylvania, as reported by [WHYY.org](https://whyy.org/articles/ukraine-president-volodymyr-zelenskyy-visits-scranton-pennsylvania-ammunition-factory/), [army.mil](https://www.army.mil/article/279907/ukrainian_president_zelenskyy_praises_scranton_dod_for_role_supporting_ukraine), and [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2024/09/23/zelensky-us-visit-ammunition-plant-pennsylvania-un-ukraine). However, there is no evidence to support the claim that Zelenskyy campaigned for Harris in Pennsylvania. Therefore, the claim is unsubstantiated.

So, the overall veracity is: false
