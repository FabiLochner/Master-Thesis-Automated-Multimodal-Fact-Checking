The claim 'In early 2025, Ukraine and Russia had reached a peace deal in their years-long war.' is true.
Justification: Based on the evidence, the claim is likely true. While initial searches showed peace talks in June 2025, a subsequent search revealed a Carnegie Endowment article discussing a ceasefire and security agreement between Ukraine and Russia in February 2025 ([https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2025/02/ukraine-russia-ceasefire-security-agreement?lang=en](https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2025/02/ukraine-russia-ceasefire-security-agreement?lang=en)), indicating a peace deal or a significant step towards it was reached in early 2025.
