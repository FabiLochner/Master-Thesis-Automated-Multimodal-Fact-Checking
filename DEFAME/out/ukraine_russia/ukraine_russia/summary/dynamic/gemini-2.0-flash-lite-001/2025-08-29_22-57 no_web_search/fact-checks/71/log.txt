The claim 'In October 2024 the International Monetary Fund (IMF) declared Russia the fourth-largest economy in the world.' is false.
Justification: The evidence confirms that the IMF published the World Economic Outlook in October 2024 ([Source](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2024/10/22/world-economic-outlook-october-2024)) and provides economic forecasts for Russia. However, the search results did not provide any information about Russia's economic ranking in October 2024. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.

So, the overall veracity is: false
