INFO: Dropping action 'reverse_search' as it was already performed.
No new actions were found in this response:
```
image_search("chemical attack Kursk offensive August 2024")
``` and performed actions: reverse_search(<image:12>), image_search("chemical attack Kursk offensive August 2024")
The claim '<image:12> This image shows a chemical attack by the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the Kursk offensive in August 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not supported by the evidence. While there was an offensive in the Kursk region in August 2024, as reported by the [Institute for the Study of War](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-august-10-2024) and [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2024/8/13/russia-ukraine-live-news-russia-hits-back-at-ukrainian-forces-in-kursk), there is no mention of a chemical attack.

So, the overall veracity is: false
