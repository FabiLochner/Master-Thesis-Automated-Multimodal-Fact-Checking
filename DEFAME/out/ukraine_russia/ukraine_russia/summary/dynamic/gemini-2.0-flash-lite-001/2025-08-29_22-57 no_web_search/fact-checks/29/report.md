### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include an image of Volodymyr Zelenskyy with Chuck Schumer and Mitch McConnell from [lailluminator.com](https://lailluminator.com/2024/09/26/zelenskyy-washington/) ![image 6778](media/2025-08-29_23-05-1756508710-875929.jpg). Another result from [abcnews.go.com](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/democrats-decry-republicans-applaud-trumps-confrontation-zelenskyy/story?id=119305519) contains an image of a meeting between Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trump ![image 6779](media/2025-08-29_23-05-1756508711-808783.jpg).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with Donald Trump. The evidence also shows that Zelenskyy met with Democrats, specifically Chuck Schumer. However, the evidence does not specify the date of these meetings.

The claim states that Zelenskyy met with Democrats *before* his meeting with Trump on February 28, 2025. The evidence does not confirm the date of either meeting, so the claim cannot be verified.

To verify the claim, information about the dates of the meetings between Zelenskyy and Trump, and Zelenskyy and Democrats, is needed.
