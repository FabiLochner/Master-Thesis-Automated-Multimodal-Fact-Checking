## Claim
Claim: "![image 1](media/0.jpg) This image shows a screenshot of an authentic Hull Daily Mail's frontpage from March 13, 2025 saying '70,000 Ukrainian soldiers in the Kursk region died in vain. The UK poured hundreds of millions of pounds into Zelensky's crushing failure'."

## Actions
```
image_search("Hull Daily Mail March 13 2025")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include a Hull Daily Mail front page from March 13, 2025, with the headline "BOY FOUND GUILTY OF ATTEMPTING TO MURDER GIRL WITH A SWORD" (![image 6640](media/2025-08-29_22-59-1756508343-697515.jpg)). Another source shows a collection of Hull Daily Mail front pages, including the one from March 13, 2025 (![image 6642](media/2025-08-29_22-59-1756508345-054333.jpg)).

Additionally, a search result from gwaramedia.com shows an image of the Hull Daily Mail front page with the headline "70,000 Ukrainian soldiers in the Kursk region died in vain," which is marked as "FAKE" (![image 6643](media/2025-08-29_22-59-1756508345-453947.jpg)).


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the Hull Daily Mail front page with the headline about Ukrainian soldiers is fake. The search results show an authentic front page from the same date with a different headline. Additionally, one of the search results explicitly labels the "Ukrainian soldiers" front page as "FAKE."


## Final Judgement
The image of the Hull Daily Mail front page with the headline about Ukrainian soldiers is not authentic. The search results reveal a genuine front page from the same date with a different headline, and another source explicitly identifies the "Ukrainian soldiers" front page as fake.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. The provided image of the Hull Daily Mail front page is not authentic. Evidence from image searches reveals a genuine front page from March 13, 2025, with a different headline, and another source explicitly labels the image as "FAKE" ([![image 6643](media/2025-08-29_22-59-1756508345-453947.jpg)](https://gwaramedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/fake-1.jpg)).
