The claim 'As of February 2025, the United States had given $350 billion in military aid to Ukraine for its war with Russia.' is false.
Justification: The claim is unverified. While evidence from Al Jazeera ([Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/17/we-will-last-six-months-if-trump-pulls-us-military-aid-from-ukraine)) and Statista ([Source](https://www.statista.com/chart/33978/us-adults-who-support-increasing-military-aid-to-ukraine/)) confirms that the US provided military aid to Ukraine in February 2025, the exact amount of $350 billion could not be verified through the search results.

So, the overall veracity is: false
