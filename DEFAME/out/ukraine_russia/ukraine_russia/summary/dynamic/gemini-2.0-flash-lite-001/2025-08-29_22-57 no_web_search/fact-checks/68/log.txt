The claim 'Majority Leader John Thune blocked Senator Adam Schiff's committee assignments because of his past work in the Russia investigation over Donald Trump.' is false.
Justification: The fact-check could not verify the claim. While image searches yielded pictures of John Thune and Adam Schiff, no evidence was found to support the assertion that Thune blocked Schiff's committee assignments due to Schiff's past work on the Russia investigation.

So, the overall veracity is: false
Fact-check took 0:33 min.
