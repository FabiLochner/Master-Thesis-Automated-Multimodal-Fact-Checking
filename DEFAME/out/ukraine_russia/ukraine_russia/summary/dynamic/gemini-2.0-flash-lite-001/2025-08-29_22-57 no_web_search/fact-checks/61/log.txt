The claim 'Russian President Vladimir Putin has died in an explosion in one of his limousines.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While a limousine from Vladimir Putin's fleet exploded in Moscow, there is no evidence to suggest that Putin was in the car or died in the explosion. Furthermore, reports from Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/24/putin-offers-condolences-after-presumed-death-of-yevgeny-prigozhin](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/24/putin-offers-condolences-after-presumed-death-of-yevgeny-prigozhin)) and The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/16/the-mysterious-violent-and-unsolved-deaths-of-putins-foes-and-critics-alexi-navalny](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/16/the-mysterious-violent-and-unsolved-deaths-of-putins-foes-and-critics-alexi-navalny)) confirm that Putin is alive.

So, the overall veracity is: false
