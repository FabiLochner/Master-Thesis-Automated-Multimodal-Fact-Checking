## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The Los Angeles Times ([Source](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2024-08-01/evan-gershkovich-paul-whelan-russia-united-states-prisoner-swap)) published an image of people inside a plane ![image 7175](media/2025-08-29_23-25-1756509937-857372.jpg). Axios ([Source](https://www.axios.com/2024/08/02/gershkovich-russia-us-prison-swap)) and The Independent ([Source](https://www.independent.co.uk/tv/news/harris-biden-russia-evan-gershkovich-prisoner-swap-video-b2590009.html)) both published images of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris greeting a freed American as he exited the plane in August 2024 ![image 7176](media/2025-08-29_23-25-1756509938-694633.jpg), ![image 7177](media/2025-08-29_23-25-1756509939-117099.jpg).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Joe Biden greeted a freed American as they exited the plane in August 2024. The Los Angeles Times ([Source](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2024-08-01/evan-gershkovich-paul-whelan-russia-united-states-prisoner-swap)) published an image of people inside a plane, but it does not show Biden boarding an empty plane.

The claim that Biden boarded an empty plane after the freed Americans exited is not supported by the evidence. The images show Biden greeting the freed Americans as they exited the plane. The evidence does not provide information about what happened after the Americans exited the plane.

Therefore, the claim is not verified.


## Actions
```
image_search("Joe Biden enter plane after freed Americans August 2024")
```

## Evidence
No new evidence found.

## Elaboration
The evidence consistently shows Joe Biden greeting freed Americans as they exited the plane in August 2024. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that Biden boarded an empty plane after the freed Americans exited. The images show Biden on the tarmac, greeting the individuals as they disembarked.

The claim is not supported by the evidence. The evidence does not provide information about whether Biden boarded the plane.


## Final Judgement
The evidence shows that Joe Biden greeted freed Americans as they exited the plane in August 2024. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that Biden boarded an empty plane after the freed Americans exited. The images show Biden on the tarmac, greeting the individuals as they disembarked. Therefore, the claim is not fully supported by the evidence.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is not supported by the evidence. While images from sources like the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/02/us/politics/biden-greeting-freed-prisoners.html), [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2024/08/02/gershkovich-russia-us-prison-swap), and [The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/tv/news/harris-biden-russia-evan-gershkovich-prisoner-swap-video-b2590009.html) show Joe Biden greeting freed Americans as they exited the plane in August 2024, there is no evidence to suggest that he boarded an empty plane afterward.
