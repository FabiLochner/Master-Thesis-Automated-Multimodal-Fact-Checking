## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image of Ben Stiller and Volodymyr Zelensky is found in multiple sources. One source, [Maldita.es](https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20250207/hollywood-disinformation-twitter-community-notes/), discusses a disinformation campaign claiming that USAID paid celebrities to visit Ukraine and states that the narrative that Ben Stiller was paid $4 million by USAID is false. Other sources, such as [Sky News](https://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-war-ben-stiller-visits-kyiv-and-tells-president-volodymyr-zelenskyy-you-are-my-hero-12636878) and [Deadline](https://deadline.com/2022/06/ukraine-zelensky-ben-stiller-visit-international-refugee-day-joe-biden-russia-war-1235048800/), report on Ben Stiller's visit to Kyiv and his meeting with Zelenskyy on June 20, 2022. ![image 6456](media/2025-08-29_22-48-1756507680-207461.jpg), ![image 6457](media/2025-08-29_22-48-1756507684-428524.jpg), ![image 6464](media/2025-08-29_22-48-1756507697-554442.jpg), ![image 6465](media/2025-08-29_22-48-1756507699-488898.jpg), ![image 6466](media/2025-08-29_22-48-1756507700-207948.jpg), ![image 6467](media/2025-08-29_22-48-1756507703-128519.jpg), ![image 6468](media/2025-08-29_22-48-1756507704-783775.jpg), ![image 6469](media/2025-08-29_22-48-1756507711-396826.jpg), ![image 6472](media/2025-08-29_22-48-1756507713-257975.jpg), ![image 6474](media/2025-08-29_22-48-1756507716-257848.jpg), ![image 6477](media/2025-08-29_22-48-1756507724-190745.jpg), ![image 6481](media/2025-08-29_22-48-1756507729-250162.jpg)


### Evidence from `image_search`
The Los Angeles Times published an article about Ben Stiller's meeting with Volodymyr Zelensky (![image 7259](media/2025-08-29_23-28-1756510096-826568.jpg)). The BBC News shows Ben Stiller meeting with Volodymyr Zelensky (![image 7260](media/2025-08-29_23-28-1756510096-950937.jpg)).

The image shows Ben Stiller and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky (![image 7261](media/2025-08-29_23-28-1756510097-311673.jpg)).


## Elaboration
The claim that the image shows Ben Stiller and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at their meeting on June 20, 2022, is supported by the evidence. Multiple sources confirm the meeting took place on that date. However, the claim that Stiller received $4 million from USAID for the meeting is false, according to [Maldita.es](https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20250207/hollywood-disinformation-twitter-community-notes/).


## Final Judgement
The image does show Ben Stiller and Volodymyr Zelensky meeting on June 20, 2022. However, the claim that Stiller received $4 million from USAID for the meeting is false.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image accurately depicts Ben Stiller and Volodymyr Zelensky's meeting on June 20, 2022. However, the assertion that Stiller received $4 million from USAID for this meeting is false, as reported by [Maldita.es](https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20250207/hollywood-disinformation-twitter-community-notes/).
