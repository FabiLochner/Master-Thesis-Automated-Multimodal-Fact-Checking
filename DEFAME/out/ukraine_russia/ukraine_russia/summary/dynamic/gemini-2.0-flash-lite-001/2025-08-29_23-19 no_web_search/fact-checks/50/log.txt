The claim 'In February 2025 German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock threatened the US with severing ties amid US President Donald Trump's comments on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Ukraine.' is false.
Justification: The fact-check reveals that while Annalena Baerbock was active and commented on Donald Trump's remarks about Zelenskyy in February 2025, as evidenced by sources like [Source](https://www.plenglish.com/news/2025/02/20/germany-criticizes-trump-for-calling-zelensky-a-dictator/), there is no evidence to support the claim that she threatened to sever ties with the US.
