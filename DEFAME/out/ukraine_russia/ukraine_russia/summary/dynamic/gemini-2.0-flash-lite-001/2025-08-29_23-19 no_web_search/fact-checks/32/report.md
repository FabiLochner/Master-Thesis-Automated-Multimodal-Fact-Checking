## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/harris-on-ukraine-world-at-a-decisive-moment-in-history): 
Content: PBS published an article about Kamala Harris and Ukraine, which includes an image of Kamala Harris with Volodymyr Zelensky ![image 7165](media/2025-08-29_23-25-1756509920-823188.jpg).


## Elaboration
The new evidence provides an image of Kamala Harris with Volodymyr Zelensky, but it does not contain the quote from the claim.

I still need to find a source that confirms Kamala Harris made the statement.


## Final Judgement
The search results show images of Kamala Harris speaking about Ukraine and Russia, but they do not contain the specific quote attributed to her in the claim. Since there is no evidence to support the claim, it cannot be verified.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The provided search results, including articles from NBC News, NPR, Al Jazeera, and PBS, do not contain the quote attributed to Kamala Harris. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.
