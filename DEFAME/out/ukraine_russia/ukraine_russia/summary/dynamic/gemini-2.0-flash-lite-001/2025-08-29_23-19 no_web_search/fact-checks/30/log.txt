The claim 'In early 2025, Ukraine and Russia had reached a peace deal in their years-long war.' is false.
Justification: The evidence indicates that peace talks between Russia and Ukraine took place in Istanbul on June 2, 2025, as reported by CNN ([Source](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/02/europe/russia-ukraine-peace-talks-turkey-drone-attack-intl)) and CFR.org ([Source](https://www.cfr.org/article/russia-and-ukraine-agree-prisoner-swap)). However, the evidence does not confirm that a peace deal was reached in early 2025. Additional searches did not yield any new information to support the claim.

So, the overall veracity is: false
