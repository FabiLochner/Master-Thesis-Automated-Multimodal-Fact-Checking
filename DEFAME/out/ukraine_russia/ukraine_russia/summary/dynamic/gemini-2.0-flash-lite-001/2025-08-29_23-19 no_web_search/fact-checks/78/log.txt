No new actions were found in this response:
```
image_search("destroyed tanks Ukraine Russia Kursk Oblast August 2024")
``` and performed actions: reverse_search(<image:26>), image_search("destroyed Ukrainian tanks Kursk Oblast August 2024"), image_search("destroyed tanks Ukraine Russia Kursk Oblast August 2024")
The claim '<image:26> This image shows destroyed Ukrainian tanks during Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024.' is false.
Justification: The image depicts destroyed tanks, and the search results confirm that the conflict in Ukraine and the Kursk region are related to tanks. However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that the image shows destroyed Ukrainian tanks during Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024, therefore the claim is unverified.

So, the overall veracity is: false
