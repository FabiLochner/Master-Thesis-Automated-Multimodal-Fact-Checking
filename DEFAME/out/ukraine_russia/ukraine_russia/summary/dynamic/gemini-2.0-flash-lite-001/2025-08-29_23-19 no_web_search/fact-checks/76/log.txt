The claim 'While serving as US President in 2024, Joe Biden ordered the US forces to prepare for possible nuclear confrontations with Russia, China, and North Korea.' is false.
Justification: In August 2024, during Joe Biden's presidency, reports from sources like The New York Times ([https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/us/politics/biden-nuclear-china-russia.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/us/politics/biden-nuclear-china-russia.html)) and The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/20/biden-nuclear-strategy-china-threat](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/20/biden-nuclear-strategy-china-threat)) indicated that the Biden administration was developing a nuclear strategy focused on China. However, the provided evidence does not mention Russia or North Korea in the context of preparing for nuclear confrontations.

So, the overall veracity is: false
