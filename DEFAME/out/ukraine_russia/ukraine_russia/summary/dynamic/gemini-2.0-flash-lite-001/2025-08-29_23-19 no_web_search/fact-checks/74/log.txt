Useful result: From [Source](https://www.businessinsider.com/before-after-satellite-images-ukraine-wipe-out-russian-ammo-depots-2024-9): 
Content: Business Insider provides a before-and-after satellite image of a location. <image:7363>

The claim '<image:23> This image shows a Russian ammunition depot in Toropets, Tver Oblast, before and after it was hit by a, possible nuclear, strike from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).' is false.
Justification: The claim is unsubstantiated. While the images show a location before and after an event, and evidence confirms the existence of a Russian ammunition depot in the area, there is no evidence to support the claim that the damage was caused by a NATO strike or a nuclear weapon. The Newsweek article ([https://www.newsweek.com/russias-haphazard-ammunition-depots-considerable-vulnerability-isw-1959027](https://www.newsweek.com/russias-haphazard-ammunition-depots-considerable-vulnerability-isw-1959027)) provides an image of a Russian ammunition depot before and after an event, but does not confirm the cause of the damage.

So, the overall veracity is: false
