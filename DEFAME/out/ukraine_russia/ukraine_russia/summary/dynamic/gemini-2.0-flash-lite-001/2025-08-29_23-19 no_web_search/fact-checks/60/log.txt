The claim '<image:19> This image shows a screenshot of an authentic X post from Elon Musk on November 6, 2025 saying 'The last dollar for Zelenskiy'.' is false.
Justification: The claim is **false**. While Elon Musk, Donald Trump, and Volodymyr Zelenskyy are public figures who have interacted, the image in the claim depicts a doctored dollar bill, indicating the X post is not authentic.

So, the overall veracity is: false
