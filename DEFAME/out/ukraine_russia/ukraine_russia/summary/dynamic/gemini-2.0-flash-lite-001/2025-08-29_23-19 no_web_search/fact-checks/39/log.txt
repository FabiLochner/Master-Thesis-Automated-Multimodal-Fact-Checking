The claim 'After InfoWars reporter Jamie White was shot dead on March 10, 2025 in Austin, Texas, it was revelaed that he was on a Ukranian enemies hit list.' is false.
Justification: The claim that Jamie White was on a Ukrainian enemies hit list after being shot dead in Austin, Texas, cannot be verified.
