The claim '<image:10> This image shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky wearing a suit after the large-scale Russian invasion in Ukraine: in a talk with Klaus Schwab at the World Economic Forum.' is false.
Justification: The image depicts Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Klaus Schwab at the World Economic Forum in Davos on January 22, 2020, as evidenced by a reverse image search. The claim incorrectly states that the image was taken after the large-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, which began later.
