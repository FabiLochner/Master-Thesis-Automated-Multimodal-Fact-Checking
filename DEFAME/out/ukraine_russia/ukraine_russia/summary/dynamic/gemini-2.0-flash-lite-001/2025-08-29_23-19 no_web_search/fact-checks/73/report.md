## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image in the claim (![image 22](media/73.jpg)) is of an F-16 Fighting Falcon that crashed into a warehouse near March Air Reserve Base in May 2019. The crash was caused by a loss of hydraulic pressure due to improperly installed parts. The pilot ejected successfully.

The articles discussing the crash were published by The Press-Enterprise ([https://www.pressenterprise.com/2020/05/01/heres-why-the-missiles-on-the-crashed-f-16-near-march-air-reserve-base-did-not-explode/](https://www.pressenterprise.com/2020/05/01/heres-why-the-missiles-on-the-crashed-f-16-near-march-air-reserve-base-did-not-explode/)), Air & Space Forces Magazine ([https://www.airandspaceforces.com/improperly-installed-parts-caused-f-16-to-crash-into-warehouse-in-may-2019/](https://www.airandspaceforces.com/improperly-installed-parts-caused-f-16-to-crash-into-warehouse-in-may-2019/)), and The Sun ([https://www.sbsun.com/2020/04/23/hydraulic-failure-caused-f-16-to-crash-near-march-base-last-year-air-force-says/](https://www.sbsun.com/2020/04/23/hydraulic-failure-caused-f-16-to-crash-near-march-base-last-year-air-force-says/)).

## Elaboration
The image in the claim (![image 22](media/73.jpg)

## Final Judgement
The image in the claim is of an F-16 that crashed in 2019 due to mechanical failure, not as a result of the Russian invasion. While Ukraine has recently lost an F-16 in a crash, the image is not related to that event.

The claim is demonstrably false because the image is taken out of context. The image is of a crash that occurred in 2019, not as a result of the Russian invasion. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image in the claim depicts an F-16 that crashed in 2019 near March Air Reserve Base due to mechanical failure, as reported by The Press-Enterprise ([https://www.pressenterprise.com/2020/05/01/heres-why-the-missiles-on-the-crashed-f-16-near-march-air-reserve-base-did-not-explode/](https://www.pressenterprise.com/2020/05/01/heres-why-the-missiles-on-the-crashed-f-16-near-march-air-reserve-base-did-not-explode/)). This crash is unrelated to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
