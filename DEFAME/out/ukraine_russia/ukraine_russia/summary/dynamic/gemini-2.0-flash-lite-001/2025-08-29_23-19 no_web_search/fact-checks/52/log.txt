The claim 'After a call with Russia's President Vladimir Putin on February 12, 2025, US President Donald Trump announced that he had reached an agreement to end the war in Ukraine.' is false.
Justification: Based on the evidence, while Donald Trump was involved in discussions related to the Ukraine war, there is no mention of a call between Trump and Putin on February 12, 2025, or an agreement to end the war. An article from Al Jazeera on February 13, 2025, mentions Trump stating Putin wants peace and will begin talks, but no agreement was announced.

So, the overall veracity is: false
