The claim 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy engaged in election interference by campaigning in Pennsylvania for Kamala Harris ahead of the US presidential election in 2024.' is false.
Justification: The fact-check reveals multiple instances of meetings between Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Kamala Harris, as evidenced by sources like [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/zelenskyys-meeting-harris-spat-trump-reveal-growing-partisan-divide-uk-rcna172648), [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/harris-standing-zelenskyy-indirectly-jabs-trump-vance-ukraine/story?id=114219628), and [AP News](https://apnews.com/article/zelenskyy-joe-biden-kamala-harris-trump-229804fd42332c584dfbe05224634e44). However, none of the provided evidence supports the claim that Zelenskyy campaigned for Harris in Pennsylvania or elsewhere. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the available information.

So, the overall veracity is: false
