Content: Getty Images shows a military parade in Poland. <image:7359>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/16/poland-holds-huge-military-parade-as-war-rages-in-neighbouring-ukraine): 
Content: Al Jazeera reports that Poland held a military parade. <image:7360> The parade took place as the war in Ukraine was ongoing. The article was published on August 16, 2023.

The claim '<image:25> This image shows a military parade of Poland's army on August 14, 2024, preparing for war with Russia.' is false.
Justification: The image depicts a military parade in Poland, which was held in August 2023, as reported by sources like [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/) and [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/). However, the claim incorrectly states the date as August 14, 2024, and falsely suggests the parade was preparation for war with Russia, which is not supported by the available evidence.

So, the overall veracity is: false
