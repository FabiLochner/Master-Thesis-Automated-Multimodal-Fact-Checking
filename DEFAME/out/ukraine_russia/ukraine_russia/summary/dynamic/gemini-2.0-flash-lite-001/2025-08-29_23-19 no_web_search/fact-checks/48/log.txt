The claim '<image:15> This image shows an authentic transcript of the heated White House meeting between US president Donald Trump, vice-president JD Vance and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy on February 28, 2025.' is false.
Justification: The claim that the image shows an authentic transcript of a White House meeting between Trump, Zelenskyy, and Vance on February 28, 2025, cannot be verified. While meetings between these individuals did occur, as evidenced by multiple sources ([<image:7235>](https://www.wwnytv.com/), [<image:7236>](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trumps-conversation-with-the-ukrainian-president-annotated), [<image:7237>](https://nationalpost.com/)), no transcript matching the image's content was found in the search results.

So, the overall veracity is: false
