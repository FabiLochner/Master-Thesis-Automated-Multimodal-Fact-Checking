The claim 'As of February 2025, the United States had given $350 billion in military aid to Ukraine for its war with Russia.' is false.
Justification: The fact-check could not verify the claim. While evidence confirms the US provided military aid to Ukraine in February 2025, the search results did not provide the specific amount of $350 billion. Therefore, the claim remains unverified.

So, the overall veracity is: false
