### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraines-zelenskiy-publishes-income-part-transparency-drive-2024-01-28/): 
Content: Reuters published an article on January 28, 2024, about Volodymyr Zelenskyy publishing his income as part of a transparency drive. ![image 7137](media/2025-08-29_23-23-1756509830-866390.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the claim is partially inaccurate. One source states that Zelenskyy did not purchase a Florida oceanfront mansion ([https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240219354828/en/Florida-Oceanfront-Mansion-Not-Purchased-by-Ukraines-Zelenskyy-Heads-to-Luxury-Auction](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240219354828/en/Florida-Oceanfront-Mansion-Not-Purchased-by-Ukraines-Zelenskyy-Heads-to-Luxury-Auction)). The evidence also shows that Zelenskyy's income has been published as part of a transparency drive ([https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraines-zelenskiy-publishes-income-part-transparency-drive-2024-01-28/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraines-zelenskiy-publishes-income-part-transparency-drive-2024-01-28/)).

The evidence does not provide information about the number of homes Zelenskyy owns, the amount of money in his overseas bank account, or his monthly income.


## Final Judgement
The claim is not entirely accurate. While the evidence confirms that Zelenskyy's income has been published, it also indicates that he did not purchase a Florida mansion. The search results do not provide enough information to verify the other parts of the claim, such as the number of homes, bank account details, and monthly income. Therefore, the claim is considered false due to the misinformation about the Florida home and the lack of supporting evidence for the other claims. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. Evidence indicates that Zelenskyy did not purchase a Florida mansion, contradicting the claim ([https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240219354828/en/Florida-Oceanfront-Mansion-Not-Purchased-by-Ukraines-Zelenskyy-Heads-to-Luxury-Auction](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240219354828/en/Florida-Oceanfront-Mansion-Not-Purchased-by-Ukraines-Zelenskyy-Heads-to-Luxury-Auction)). While Zelenskyy's income has been published ([https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraines-zelenskiy-publishes-income-part-transparency-drive-2024-01-28/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraines-zelenskiy-publishes-income-part-transparency-drive-2024-01-28/)), the other details in the claim, such as the number of homes, bank account details, and monthly income, are not supported by the provided evidence.
