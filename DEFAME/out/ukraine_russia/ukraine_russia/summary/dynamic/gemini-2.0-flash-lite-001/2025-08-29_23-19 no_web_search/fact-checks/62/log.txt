The claim '<image:20> This image shows a US drone which was shot down in March 2025 by the Houthis using Russian missiles.' is false.
Justification: The image depicts a scene in Israel, as indicated by the geolocation analysis, contradicting the claim that it shows a US drone shot down by the Houthis in Yemen. The provided evidence, including reports from CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/09/politics/us-navy-houthi-missiles-drones-red-sea](https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/09/politics/us-navy-houthi-missiles-drones-red-sea)), The New York Times ([https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/08/world/middleeast/yemen-houthi-us-drone.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/08/world/middleeast/yemen-houthi-us-drone.html)), and USNI News ([https://news.usni.org/2023/12/16/u-k-american-warships-shoot-down-houthi-launched-drones-in-red-sea](https://news.usni.org/2023/12/16/u-k-american-warships-shoot-down-houthi-launched-drones-in-red-sea)), does not support the claim's specific details about the location, date, or the involvement of the Houthis.

So, the overall veracity is: false
