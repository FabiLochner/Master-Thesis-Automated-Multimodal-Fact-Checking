Useful result: From [Source](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-march-15-2025): 
Content: The Institute for the Study of War and AEI's Critical Threats Project published a map showing the assessed control of terrain in the Kursk direction on March 15, 2025. <image:7047> The map indicates Russian advances in the area.

The claim '<image:7> This image shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky arriving in August 2024 in the Sudzha of Kursk region, Russia, which had just been occupied by Ukrainian troops in the Kursk Offensive, and meeting with representatives of the people there.' is false.
Justification: The image of Volodymyr Zelensky was taken in May 2022 in the Kharkiv region, not in August 2024 in the Sudzha of the Kursk region, as claimed. The evidence from the BBC ([https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-europe-61612803](https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-europe-61612803)) and other sources confirms the correct date and location. Additionally, the claim that Ukrainian troops occupied the Kursk region is not supported by the provided evidence.

So, the overall veracity is: false
