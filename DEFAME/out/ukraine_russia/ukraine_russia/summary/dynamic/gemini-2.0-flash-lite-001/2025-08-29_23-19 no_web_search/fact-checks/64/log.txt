Content: Axios reports that Macron called Putin a "butcher" in March 2022. <image:7324>

The claim 'French President Emmanuel Macron called Russian President Vladimir Putin a 'butcher' during his press conference with Donald Trump on Monday, Feb. 24, 2025.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While Emmanuel Macron did call Vladimir Putin a "butcher," according to an Axios report ([https://www.axios.com/2022/03/27/macron-putin-biden-escalate](https://www.axios.com/2022/03/27/macron-putin-biden-escalate)), this occurred in March 2022, not during a press conference with Donald Trump on February 24, 2025.

So, the overall veracity is: false
