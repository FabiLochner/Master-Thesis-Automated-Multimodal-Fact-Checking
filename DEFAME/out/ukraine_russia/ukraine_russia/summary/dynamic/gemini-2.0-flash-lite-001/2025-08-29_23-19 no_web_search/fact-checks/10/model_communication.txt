Recovery operations at the site of a building hit in Russia's attack on July 8, 2024. (Interior Ministry / Telegram)

The body of a boy was found under the rubble of a building hit by a Russian strike in Kyiv's Schevchenkyvskyi district, bringing the death toll of the July 8 attack on the city to 27, the Interior Ministry said on July 9.

Among the dead are four children, the [Interior Ministry said](https://t.me/mvs_ukraine/39672)
. Another 117 people were injured in Kyiv and seven were rescued from buildings that had been damaged in the strike.

Emergency services are still working at three sites, the ministry said.

Schevchenkyvskyi district is the location of both a residential building hit in Russia's strike and the [Okhmatdyt hospital](https://kyivindependent.com/russian-missile-attack-hits-okhmatdyt-children-hospital-casualties-reported/)
, Ukraine's largest children's medical center, which Russia [directly targeted](https://kyivindependent.com/russian-missile-struck-childrens-hospital-in-kyiv-following-programmed-route-source-says/)
.

The Russian military struck the children's [hospital](https://kyivindependent.com/who-data-suggest-more-ukrainians-could-die-in-medical-site-attacks-in-2024/)
 with a Kh-101 cruise missile, according to the preliminary data obtained by the [**State Security Service**](https://t.me/SBUkr/12339)
 (SBU), killing at least two people and injuring at least 50.

Russia launched [**another attack**](https://kyivindependent.com/latest-russian-attack-on-kyiv-hits-maternity-hospital-4-killed/)
 against Kyiv later during the day, with debris damaging a maternity hospital in another district, killing seven people.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.

This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing.

* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion.

The new evidence from Statista provides a chart on the share of U.S. adults who support increasing, maintaining, or decreasing military aid to Ukraine. However, it does not provide the amount of military aid given.

The claim remains unverified due to the lack of information on the total amount of military aid provided by the US to Ukraine as of February 2025.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The fact-check reveals that while there is evidence of the US providing military aid to Ukraine around February 2025, the exact amount of $350 billion is not confirmed by the provided sources. The search results focus on the discussion and public opinion regarding the aid, but they do not specify the monetary value.

**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion.

# Instructions
You are provided with the record of a fact-check. It contains the Claim to be verified and a documentation of all the fact-checking work along the gathered evidence. Your task is to **summarize the fact-check**. That is, you provide a concise, one-paragraph justification for the final VERDICT based on the knowledge from the Record. Note:
* Be truthful, brief, do not add any additional information besides the information given in the Record. 
* Link key sources in your summary. Use Markdown notation for that. You may link them in-line.
* Don't state the Claim again. Rather focus on the key insights of the fact-check.
* Simply print just the summary.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris once said, 'Ukraine is a country in Europe. It exists next to another country called Russia. Russia is a bigger country. Russia is a powerful country. Russia decided to invade a smaller country called Ukraine. So basically that's wrong.'"

## Actions
```

```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
NBC News published an article about Kamala Harris warning Russia about sanctions if it invades Ukraine, which includes an image of Kamala Harris speaking <image:7159>. The NPR article from February 18, 2023, also contains an image of Kamala Harris <image:7160>.

The search result from Al Jazeera contains an image of Kamala Harris <image:7161>.

## Elaboration
The evidence contains images of Kamala Harris speaking about Russia and Ukraine. However, the provided search results do not contain the quote attributed to her in the claim.

To verify the claim, I need to find a source that confirms Kamala Harris made the statement.

## Elaboration
The new evidence provides an image of Kamala Harris with Volodymyr Zelensky, but it does not contain the quote from the claim.

I still need to find a source that confirms Kamala Harris made the statement.


## Final Judgement
The search results show images of Kamala Harris speaking about Ukraine and Russia, but they do not contain the specific quote attributed to her in the claim. Since there is no evidence to support the claim, it cannot be verified.

`false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The provided search results, including articles from NBC News, NPR, Al Jazeera, and PBS, do not contain the quote attributed to Kamala Harris. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.

For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion.

From [Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-house-vote-long-awaited-95-billion-ukraine-israel-aid-package-2024-04-20/): 
Content: Reuters published an article on April 20, 2024, about the US House vote on a Ukraine aid package. The article includes an image of the US and Ukrainian flags in front of the Capitol Building. <image:6852>


## Elaboration
The evidence does not contain any information about the claim.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence reveals discussions about US aid to Ukraine, including articles on corruption and oversight. However, none of the provided sources support the claim that half of the US aid was laundered and sent to Democrat candidates. The Institute for the Study of War fact sheet ([https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/us-assistance-ukraine-fact-sheet](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/us-assistance-ukraine-fact-sheet)) indicates extensive US and Ukrainian government oversight.

Therefore, based on the available evidence, the claim remains unsubstantiated.

Volodymyr Zelensky (left) and Joe Biden said they would focus on Ukraine's "victory plan" at their White House talks

Volodymyr Zelensky is meeting Joe Biden and Kamala Harris at the White House to discuss his "victory plan", which the Ukrainian president hopes will pressure Russia into agreeing a diplomatic end to the war.

Details have been kept secret, but Zelensky is likely to ask the US president and vice-president for continuing military and financial support, as well as security guarantees.

It comes amid a row with Donald Trump and the Republican party ahead of November's US presidential election.

They were angered by Zelensky's visit to an arms factory in Biden's hometown of Scranton with top Democrats. Zelensky will meet Trump on Friday despite earlier reports that the meeting had been cancelled.

Zelensky's visit to the ammunition factory in the key swing state of Pennsylvania was labelled by leading Republicans as a partisan campaign event.

In a public letter, speaker of the US House Mike Johnson said the visit was "designed to help Democrats" and claimed it amounted to "election interference".

He also demanded that Ukraine fire its ambassador to Washington who helped arrange the visit.

The Republican-led House Oversight Committee has also announced it would investigate whether Zelensky's trip was an attempt to use a foreign leader to benefit Harris's campaign.

Her Republican rival for the presidency, Donald Trump, mocked Zelensky at a campaign event as the "greatest salesman on Earth" and accused him of refusing to "make a deal" with Moscow.

Earlier this week, Trump also praised Russia's military capabilities, saying: "They beat Hitler, they beat Napoleon - that’s what they do, they fight."

The two men have long had a fractious relationship. In 2019, Trump was impeached by the US House over accusations that he pressured Ukraine's leader to dig up damaging information on a political rival.

The row clouded a week in which Zelensky has twice addressed the United Nations, ramping up efforts to persuade the US and other allies to boost support more than two and a half years into Russia's full-scale invasion.

At the White House meetings, Zelensky is expected to push again for US backing to fire Western-made long-range missiles deep into Russian territory, which Biden has so far blocked.

Before the meeting, Biden said: "Let me be clear, Russia will not prevail in war... Ukraine will prevail".

He also pledged to support Kyiv "in its path to membership to both the EU and Nato".

Meanwhile, Zelensky thanked the US for its "unwavering bipartisan support".

He later met Harris, with the vice-president reiterating her support for Ukraine and arguing the US must continue its role of global leadership.

With Russian troops advancing in the east of Ukraine, the outcome of Zelensky's meeting with Biden and Harris is seen by many experts as a key moment in his attempt to shore up US support before the November election.

On Wednesday, Russia's Vladimir Putin announced a plan to revise Moscow's nuclear doctrine, to enable Russia to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states if they are supported by nuclear states.

Putin's spokesperson later clarified that it was meant as a "specific signal" to the West.

President Volodymyr Zelensky visited the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant alongside top Democrats on Friday

Hours before his meeting with Zelensky, Biden announced a $7.9bn (£5.9bn) package of military assistance to Ukraine.

The aid, part of a $61bn package that passed Congress in April, will be approved through presidential drawdown authority and will pull from existing Pentagon supplies to deliver the arms more quickly.

Congressional Republicans blocked the package for months earlier this year, before ultimately relenting and passing the legislation. The delay caused arms supplies to Ukraine to dry up for several months.

Zelensky thanked the US - Ukraine's largest foreign donor.

At the same time, he also reportedly expressed frustration at the delay in delivering weapons that were already promised when he met US congressmen on Thursday morning.

What was [Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky](https://nypost.com/2024/09/25/us-news/house-gop-accuses-kamala-harris-of-using-zelensky-as-campaign-surrogate-launches-foreign-interference-inquiry/)
 doing at what sure _looked_ like a partisan US political event this week?

And how did the White House let this happen?

Zelensky got flown into battleground Pennsylvania aboard a USAF C-17 plane on Tuesday; he then toured the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant accompanied by Gov. Josh Shapiro, Sen. Bob Casey, Rep. Matt Cartwright — the last two being active Democratic candidates.

And it looks like no GOP candidates got invited — trapping a foreign head of state into apparently taking sides in US domestic politics.

Yet Zelensky was guarded by Secret Service agents and driven around in Secret Service vehicles, adding more reek of impropriety: Who covered those expenses?

Someone in the Biden administration pulled a fast one: Pennsylvania has a fair number of anti-Russian Polish-Americans and others of Eastern European heritage who might be swayed by Zelensky’s seeming preference.

Legalities aside, this is terrible for Zelensky: Ukraine desperately needs support from Republicans as well as Democrats in Congress, and will no matter who holds the White House next year.

House Speaker Mike Johnson is calling on Zelensky to fire his US ambassador for letting this disgrace happen, a move that could mend _Ukraine’s_ fences here.

But Congress will need answers on the American side, too: After all, Democrats impeached President Donald Trump over _his_ supposed abuses linked to Ukraine; now we have the misuse of a foreign guest’s visit to influence US politics.

We absolutely endorse US support of Kyiv against Moscow’s brutal invasion: Vladimir Putin must not succeed.

And Democratic candidates have every right to slam those Republicans who want to hang Ukraine out to dry.

But dragging any foreign leader, _especially_ one who’s seeking now new support for his nation from the White House, into US politics is morally criminal — at least.

Whether at the White House or the State Department, _American_ heads need to roll over this."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

Claves:

*   The disinformation campaign that claims that the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has paid for celebrities to visit Ukraine has spread in at least nine languages
*   Maldita.es has analyzed more than 40 Twitter posts (now X) with this narrative that, in just three days, has more than 20 million views and only 14% have a note from the community denying it
*   Channels and websites linked to the Kremlin have published this disinformation narrative since the first day it began to be distributed

  

* * *

The video claiming that the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) [has paid for visits by several prominent US officials to Ukraine](https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20250206/video-angelina-jolie-orlando-bloom-visita-ucrania/)
 has gone viral with (fake) messages **in at least nine different languages** ​​(German, Spanish, French, English, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Dutch and Romanian). Its impact has thus crossed borders, reaching more than 20 million views [on Twitter (now X)](https://maldita.es/malditatecnologia/20230724/twitter-x-cambio-nombre-logo-elon-musk/)
 in just three days.

para que no te la cuelen!](https://bit.ly/3EGa2ju)

For this study, [Maldita.es](https://Maldita.es)
 has analysed [more than 40 posts](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gRE1WgvW3L5ECNejPxnxvudHNbJJQpdIW3HINA9UCo4/edit?gid=0#gid=0)
 (all of them with more than 5,000 views at 5pm on 7 February 2025) that spread this video with disinformation messages through X. These contents have been published over three days (between 5 and 7 February) and, together, they add up to millions of views on the platform. Even so, only 14.3% (that is, six out of 42) have [community notes](https://maldita.es/malditatecnologia/20240917/notas-de-la-comunidad-twitter-x/)
 warning users that it is disinformation content.

! <image:6457>

The narrative was also widely disseminated by channels and websites linked to or close to the Kremlin, both in Spain and in Russia and other countries between February 5 and 7.

**This disinformation narrative has 20 million views in three days and nine languages**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**The narrative shared in X:** USAID has sponsored visits by American celebrities (such as Angelina Jolie, Ben Stiller, Orlando Bloom, Sean Penn, and Jean-Claude Van Damme) to Ukraine since the Russian invasion began, in order to boost Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s popularity in the United States and better coordinate its funding programs. Much of the content provides as supposed “proof” a video with the logo of [E!News, a “celebrity and entertainment news” website in the United States](https://archive.ph/s1f93)
.

**The fact-check:** [The video circulating is not from E!News](https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20250206/video-angelina-jolie-orlando-bloom-visita-ucrania/)
. There is also [**no evidence**](https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20250206/video-angelina-jolie-orlando-bloom-visita-ucrania/)
 **of USAID's alleged payments to the celebrities it mentions.** Ben Stiller, the American actor and comedian who is the subject of the disinformation, has said that it is “completely false.”

Even so, [Maldita.es](https://Maldita.es)
 [has located up to 42 contents with more than 5,000 views](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gRE1WgvW3L5ECNejPxnxvudHNbJJQpdIW3HINA9UCo4/edit?gid=0#gid=0)
 as of February 7 that spread this narrative on X. These have been published between February 5 and 7, 2025 and are shared in at least seven languages ​​in addition to Spanish: German, French, English, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Dutch and Romanian. Some [have several million views](https://archive.ph/xuARn)
 and, together (and in just three days), they add up to more than 20 million views within this platform alone.

**Channels and websites linked to the Kremlin have been publishing this disinformation narrative since February 5**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since February 5, social media channels linked to the Kremlin or that routinely share disinformation pushed by Russia have also been spreading the video accusing USAID of paying Hollywood stars to travel to Ukraine.

On February 5, the X account “Russia Informa,” which has almost 80,000 followers, [shared the video](https://archive.li/OMGEP)
 with claims such as “USAID paid Hollywood stars to visit Kyiv after the start of the special operation. The E!News portal published the details. Angelina Jolie cost the most: 20 million.” Also [the Telegram channel](https://archive.ph/NEJeQ)
 “Irinamar,” which claims to share content with a “Russian view of the special operation in Ukraine,” or “[Wars and Geopolitics](https://archive.ph/rTjNU)
”, among others, published a post that same day.

On February 6, it was shared **by the website Spanish News Pravda**, a website that is part of the Pravda ecosystem and that, according to the [Viginum agency](https://www.sgdsn.gouv.fr/notre-organisation/composantes/service-de-vigilance-et-protection-contre-les-ingerences-numeriques)
, belonging to the General Secretariat of National Defense and Security of France, “one of its main objectives is to spread disinformation and pro-Russian propaganda in different EU languages”. In Spain, [Spanish News Pravda has published](https://maldita.es/index.php/malditobulo/20241106/comitiva-rey-paginas-rusas-arabe/)
 disinformation such as the hoax about Felipe VI’s motorcade in Valencia after the passage of the DANA [or the hoax that Coca-Cola had donated mobile morgues](https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20241203/morgue-mobile-cocacola-ucrania/)
 with its logo to Ukraine. On this occasion, Spanish News Pravda published it on two occasions ([1](https://archive.ph/bqahS)
 and [2](https://archive.li/PdxYX)
).

Liu Sivaya [also shared the E!News video](https://archive.li/2hpjN)
 on the 6th on her X account, where she has nearly 200,000 followers.

Between February 5 and 6, it was also actively disseminated “by Russian propaganda outlets, including Tsargrad, Russia Today, EurAsia Daily, Rossiyskaya Gazeta, Military Review, and Vesti,” explain Georgian fact-checkers [Myth Detector, who have also verified the content](https://mythdetector.com/en/usaid-paid-actors/)
. They add that it was shared not only by Kremlin-controlled outlets, “but also by networks affiliated with the Georgian government, including the pro-government POSTV, several media channels, as well as individual accounts,” as they identify in the published article.

**Only six of the 42 disinformation contents have Community Notes**
-------------------------------------------------------------------

At the time of publication of this text, 85.7% of the contents analysed (i.e. 37 out of 42) **are circulating on X without** [**community notes**](https://maldita.es/malditatecnologia/20240917/notas-de-la-comunidad-twitter-x/)
. Only in six of the more than 40 cases does the warning system of Elon Musk's platform indicate that they are disinformation content. These posts are written in Spanish (3), German (1), French (1) and English (1). None of the contents with more than 5,000 views that have been taken into account in this analysis in Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Dutch or Romanian contain these messages.

! <image:6466>

Those cases in which the Community Notes have been applied do not reach 125.000 views in any single post. In fact, [the tweet with the most impact](https://archive.ph/xuARn)
 that [Maldita.es](https://Maldita.es)
 has found with this narrative (which has, as of the date of publication of this text, more than 15.8 million views) [**does not have a visible warning**](https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20250207/ben-stiller-tuit-desinformador-nota-comunidad/)
**,** more than 36 hours after its publication. It is the first post in a thread in English that states that “USAID paid Ben Stiller 4 million dollars to take these photos with Zelensky.” This message is accompanied by two images (which are real) of the American actor and comedian with the president of Ukraine.

! <image:6467>

[Community Notes is the system implemented](https://maldita.es/nosotros/20250117/notas-comunidad-verificadores-juntos-funcione/)
 in X that allows users to add context to misleading tweets. [Although this is only selected and displayed when it is rated](https://maldita.es/malditatecnologia/20240917/notas-de-la-comunidad-twitter-x/#:~:text=en%20la%20desinformaci%C3%B3n%3F-,%C2%BFC%C3%B3mo%20funcionan%20las%20Notas%20de%20la%20comunidad%3F,-Las%20Notas%20de)
 as useful by enough contributors with “different points of view.” In fact**,** [**there are actually notes proposed**](https://archive.is/QieM8)
 **in the tweet with more than 15.8 million views**, as mentioned above. And why are they not displayed? Due to a lack of consensus between contributors, who present “different points of view” according to the platform’s rules.

! <image:6468>

This is precisely one of the points to improve the X Community Notes system identified by [Maldita.es](https://Maldita.es)
 [in its analysis](https://maldita.es/nosotros/20250117/notas-comunidad-verificadores-juntos-funcione/)
. One of the problems it raises is that many of the notes that are proposed and that refute viral misinformation are never shown to users. It also points against the need for consensus among users, who tend to disagree. 

Thus, several contexts have been identified in which community notes have not been sufficient to combat hoaxes. For example, [during the disinformation campaign](https://maldita.es/malditatecnologia/20241127/dana-notas-comunidad-x-twitter/)
 that emerged on social networks as a result [of the DANA of October 2024](https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20241030/bulos-y-desinformaciones-sobre-el-paso-de-la-dana-en-el-este-y-sur-de-espana-en-octubre-de-2024/)
: out of 176 tweets analysed with disinformation narratives about heavy rains, only 8.5% had visible community notes. They were also not enough to stop the spread of the [hoax of the video of the European Parliament applauding the launch of missiles from Ukraine to Russia](https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20241125/parlamento-europeo-aplausos-misiles-ucrania/)
. This content was spread in at least [five different languages on X](https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20241126/bulo-parlamento-europeo-misiles-europa/)
 and none of those analysed by [Maldita.es](https://Maldita.es)
 had community notes.

**61.9% of posts are from users with a blue tick, but that does not mean they are trustworthy**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A common factor detected in this analysis is that most of the accounts that have shared the narrative about USAID allegedly paying US celebrities to visit Ukraine in X **pay the premium version**. Of the 42 pieces of content analysed, **37 were published by users with the so-called** [**blue tick**](https://maldita.es/malditatecnologia/20230421/Twitter-tic-azul-original-cambios/)
 (61.9% of the total). In fact, among the ten most viral tweets, there is only one tweet that does not have the blue tick.

**This disinformative narrative is circulated in at least nine languages within X**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The contents that have had the greatest impact so far are those disseminated in English. Of the 42 analysed by [Maldita.es](https://Maldita.es)
, **13 have been published in English.** In total, they have had more than 18.4 million views (an average of 1.4 million per publication). 

! <image:6472>

The **content in French**, meanwhile, has an average of **106,000 views per tweet**. The nine tweets taken into account for this analysis reach almost one million reproductions (958,821 views in total). 

Although to a lesser extent and with less impact, content in Portuguese, Spanish, German and Romanian was also found. Four publications in each of these languages were used in this analysis. Of this group, those published in Portuguese and Spanish have had the greatest reach (with an average of 61,000 and 44,000 reproductions, respectively). There were also three tweets in Italian (with 44,000 total views) and two in Polish (with a total of 11,765 views) and one in Dutch (with 20,100 views).

These 42 pieces of content do not reflect the full impact of the dissemination of this narrative. During the analysis, [Maldita.es](https://Maldita.es)
 **has located dozens of tweets** in localized languages ​​with less than 5,000 views. In addition, this misinformation [has been shared on X](https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20250206/video-angelina-jolie-orlando-bloom-visita-ucrania/#:~:text=El%20v%C3%ADdeo%20ha%20sido%20compartido%20en%20Twitter%2C%20ahora%20X%2C%20por%20Donald%20Trump%20Junior%20o%20Elon%20Musk)

[Why you can trust Sky News](/info/policies-and-standards)

Hollywood star Ben Stiller has met Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, telling the actor-turned-leader: "You are my hero."

The US actor, 56, who has been meeting with refugees in **[Poland](https://news.sky.com/topic/poland-6132)
** and **[Ukraine](https://news.sky.com/topic/ukraine-6556)
** since 18 June, shook hands with the wartime premier as they met in Kyiv.

**[UK would be 'right to prepare for war' - Ukraine war latest updates](https://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-news-live-war-russia-putin-eu-membership-12541713)
**

He told President Zelenskyy: "It's great honour for me. You are my hero. You quit a great acting career for this."

"Not so great as you," he replied.

But Stiller insisted: "What you have done, the way you rallied the country and for the world, it's really inspiring."

The actor spoke of his time visiting the war-torn country, and the devastation he had seen.

"I feel that it's hard to understand what's going on here if you haven't been here.

"We were talking about the actual impact of coming here. I just was in Irpin this morning, saw the level of destruction.

"You see it on TV, you see it on social media, it's something else to actually see it and feel it and then to talk to people. We have talked to a bunch of people."

**.

The pair discussed the difficulties keeping the war in Ukraine in the global public eye after so many months of fighting.

President Zelenskyy said: "It is not interesting to speak about the war every day for an audience, for different people, but for us it is very important.

"When people forget to speak about this influence and how to push Russia, it's very difficult."

Looking at Stiller, he added: "Thanks to people like you, we can do it."

**

As he visited eastern Europe, Stiller has released a video message urging global support for Ukrainian refugees and the 100 million refugees around the world.

In his message he said: "I'm here meeting people who've been impacted by the work and hearing how it's changed their lives.

"War and violence are devastating people all over the world. No one chooses to flee their home. Seeking safety is a right and it needs to be upheld for every person."

Last week Stiller, who is a UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) goodwill ambassador, had flown to Rzeszow in southeastern Poland.

On Sunday he was also spotted walking in the western city of Lviv, which has come under attack by [**Russian**](https://news.sky.com/topic/russia-5803)
 forces during the months-long invasion but has remained relatively unscathed compared to the ferocious assaults in the east of the country.

On his Instagram page, Stiller said he was meeting families "whose lives have been torn apart by war and violence in [**Ukraine**](https://news.sky.com/topic/ukraine-6556)
".

He said millions of people have been forced to flee their homes, with more than 90% being women and children, following the invasion by President Vladimir Putin's troops.

Stiller added: "I'm here to learn, to share stories that illustrate the human impact of war and to amplify calls for solidarity.

"Everyone has the right to seek safety. Whoever. Wherever. Whenever."

In one image, he was photographed meeting workers from the UNHCR.

In another post, the Zoolander and Tropic Thunder star was pictured hugging two refugee children near the Medyka border in Poland.

Since the war began, a number of stars from the music and film industries have visited Ukraine and its neighbouring countries.

In April, Hollywood actress and UN humanitarian Angelina Jolie [**made a surprise visit to Lviv**](https://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-war-angelina-jolie-seen-in-lviv-amid-russias-invasion-12602639)

 told Ukrainian President [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://deadline.com/tag/volodymyr-zelenskyy/)
 today on a visit to Kyiv. “You gave up a great acting career for this,” the _Severance_ filmmaker joked with the former _Servant of the People_ star.

“Not so great as you,” Zelenskyy responded with perfect comic timing to laughing UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador Stiller.

Showing up in [Ukraine](https://deadline.com/tag/ukraine/)

### Watch on Deadline

POTUS today said that is “not likely” he will go to Ukraine while in Europe later this week.

Speaking with reporters briefly on a wide range of topics this morning, Biden added that he did not want to “cause more difficulty for Ukrainians” by swooping into Kyiv as other leaders and celebrities have over the past months. Still, having visited with Ukrainian refugees on a trip to Poland in March, Biden could be planning a surprise touch down in Kyiv as he travels in Germany and Spain in the coming days.

On the other hand, before meeting Zelenskyy on Monday, Stiller walked among the ruins of Irpin and talked to survivors of the Russian attacks. “It’s one thing to see this destruction on TV or on social networks. Another thing is to see it all with your own eyes,” said the actor to Zelenskyy later in the duo’s sit-down. “That’s a lot more shocking.”

“What you saw in Irpin is definitely dreadful,” the battle garbed Ukrainian leader told Stiller. “But it is even worse to just imagine what is happening in the settlements that are still under temporary occupation in the east.”

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence includes articles about corruption in Ukraine and the US, as well as images of US politicians. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that the image shows an authentic list released by Ukraine detailing bribes taken by US politicians. The evidence does not mention any such list or provide any information about US politicians taking bribes from Ukraine.

The claim also states that the highest bribe was $92 million for Joe Biden. While the evidence includes images of Joe Biden, there is no information about his net worth or any alleged bribes.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence.

_________________________



JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

The evidence indicates that a limousine from Vladimir Putin's fleet exploded and caught fire in Moscow. However, the provided sources do not confirm that Putin was in the car or that he died in the explosion.

The India Today article ([https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/limousine-from-vladimir-putins-fleet-explodes-in-moscow-catches-fire-report-2701228-2025-03-30](https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/limousine-from-vladimir-putins-fleet-explodes-in-moscow-catches-fire-report-2701228-2025-03-30)) and Northeast Live TV ([https://northeastlivetv.com/topnews/putins-2-75-lakh-luxury-limo-explodes/](https://northeastlivetv.com/topnews/putins-2-75-lakh-luxury-limo-explodes/)) report on the explosion.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that the Wall Street Journal published an article with an image of J.D. Vance. CNN also published an article about J.D. Vance on February 14, 2025. However, the evidence does not explicitly state whether J.D. Vance discussed US military action against Russia in the Wall Street Journal interview.

To verify the claim, I need to examine the content of the Wall Street Journal article.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The search results confirm that the Wall Street Journal published an article with an image of J.D. Vance and that CNN published an article about J.D. Vance on February 14, 2025. However, the search results do not provide the content of the Wall Street Journal article to verify if J.D. Vance made the statement in question.

Since the content of the Wall Street Journal article is missing, there is not enough information to verify the claim. `not enough information`

## Elaboration
The IMF published the World Economic Outlook October 2024. The Kyiv Post provides an image from the IMF with economic forecasts for Europe, including real GDP growth projections for Russia for 2024, 2025, and 2026. Statista includes a graph showing the IMF's real GDP year-over-year growth estimates/projections in Russia, "As of Jan. 2025".

The evidence confirms that the IMF released economic data in October 2024. However, the provided evidence does not contain information about the IMF declaring Russia the fourth-largest economy in the world.

To verify the claim, I need to find the IMF's ranking of the world's largest economies in October 2024.

При [бегстве из Балаклеи](https://apostrophe.ua/news/society/2022-09-08/v-balaklee-i-okrestnyih-selah-podnyali-ukrainskie-flagi-foto-i-video/278860)
 в Харьковской области российские оккупанты потеряли очень много живой силы и техники.

Подробности феерического отступления россиян появляются в сети.

Украинский журналист Денис Казанский [опубликовал](https://t.me/kazansky2017/3989)
 красноречивое фото, на котором два бойца ВСУ "селфятся" на фоне лежащего на земле "орка".

"_Теперь уже можно! Балаклея - это Украина!_", - подписан кадр.

![](https://static.apostrophe.ua/uploads/image/d65ce3221fb2320e1df433cbd2684f2e.jpg)

Кроме того, в Балаклее у оккупантов очень большие потери. Россияне драпали так быстро, что [бросали](https://t.me/kazansky2017/3991?single)
 тела погибших сослуживцев.

**Осторожно, жесткие кадры! 18+**

Разгром российской армии в Балаклее стал расплатой за Иловайск в 2014 году, [отмечает](https://t.me/kazansky2017/3994)
 журналист, добавляя, что на дорогах в округе повсюду разбитая и брошенная техника оккупантов.

Еще один украинский журналист Анатолий Цаплиенко [сообщает](https://t.me/Tsaplienko/15021)
, что россияне пробовали убежать, но на дороге их встретила засада украинских бойцов. Чем все закончилось, можно посмотреть на видео.

Напомним, Президент Украины [Владимир Зеленский официально подтвердил освобождение города Балаклеи в Харьковской области от российских оккупантов](https://apostrophe.ua/news/society/2022-09-08/teper-ofitsialno-zelenskiy-podtverdil-osvobojdenie-balaklei-ot-okkupantov/278876)
.

  

##### Президент Зеленский предположил, что война может завершиться в 2026 году. Верите ли вы в это?

Да, это возможно

Нет, сомневаюсь

Трудно сказать

!Оккупанты понесли огромные потери при паническом бегстве из Балаклеи <image:2752>

Многие российские военные попали в засаду.

При бегстве из Балаклеи в Харьковской области российские оккупанты потеряли очень много живой силы и техники.

Подробности феерического отступления россиян появляются в сети, сообщает [«Апостроф»](https://apostrophe.ua/news/society/2022-09-08/rasplata-za-ilovaysk-okkupantyi-ponesli-ogromnyie-poteri-pri-begstve-iz-balaklei-video/278880/)

Российские войска отступают. Как развивается украинское контрнаступление и чем успехи ВСУ последних недель грозят России — мнение экспертов и российских военных

Украина [объявила](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1018539645523163)
 о контрнаступлении на юге страны в Херсонской области 29 августа, а 6 сентября начала наступательную операцию на востоке — в Харьковской области. За это время украинская армия освободила десятки населенных пунктов и продвинулась вглубь российских оборонительных позиций. Поступают сообщения о том, что российские войска отступают из стратегически важных городов — Балаклеи, Купянска, Изюма, Волчанска и Лимана. Военные эксперты называют события последних двух недель невообразимым [успехом](https://republic.ru/posts/105163)

### **Российские войска не могут держать оборону и бегут**

«8 лет говорили что и когда будут делать: один треп, обо всем со всех щелей. Никакой тактики, никакого профессионализма, никакого ума. Когда на это \[контрнаступление ВСУ\] смотрим мы \[военные\], мы понимаем, что изначально все было сделано неправильно. Но забили на это хуй, начали двигаться дальше криво, коряво. А с другой \[украинской\] стороны, люди просто взяли, увидели это, соорганизовались, все сделали. ‎

Поэтому в плане войны все выглядит очень логично: мы начали как долбоебы, не смогли ничего удержать, всё разъебали, один сплошной пиздеж вокруг, командования ноль, обеспечения ноль, руководства ноль. И вот изначально было понятно, что будет заканчиваться тем, что нас просто разнесут», — комментирует «‎Важным историям»‎ ситуацию на фронте бывший российский военнослужащий, который участвовал в войне в Украине. «Вспоминаю, как долго \[ВС РФ\] ковыряли Мариуполь и Северодонецк, а тут два дня \[понадобилось ВСУ\]. \[При том, что\] Изюм чуть ли не с первых дней войны был под контролем \[российских войск\], то есть они даже не планировали и не думали, что его, возможно, придется оборонять», — недоумевает другой бывший российский военный.

При этом, в [брифинге](https://t.me/mod_russia/19716)
 российского Минобороны от 10 сентября не было сказано ни слова об оставленных российскими войсками городах. Позже Минобороны [объяснило](https://t.me/mod_russia/19719)
 отступление российских войск «операцией по свертыванию и переброске Изюмско-Балаклейской группировки» для наращивания усилий по «освобождению Донбасса».

«Сейчас мы видим, как российские войска бегут, потому что не могут держать оборону», — описывает происходящее украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. Этому предшествовал первый крупный успех ВСУ в Харьковской области — освобождение 8 сентября города Балаклея, который был оккупирован с марта. «Это место, где сосредоточены склады с боеприпасами для артиллерии, поэтому \[ее освобождение\] достаточно серьезно усилит огневые возможности ВСУ», — говорит военный эксперт.

Именно освобождение Балаклеи позволило ВСУ лишить российскую группировку, которая там сконцентрирована, возможности держать оборону, поскольку отрезало их от «логистической артерии» Волчанск-Большой Бурлук-Купянск-Изюм, по которой происходило снабжение армии, объясняет эксперт. «Без снабжения вся эта масса личного состава и техники, сконцентрированная на Изюмском направлении, оказалась бы не боеспособной», — говорит Коваленко.

По словам российского военного эксперта Юрия Федорова, у российских войск на этом направлении «очень крупные потери»: не только убитыми, но и пленными: «как минимум сотни пленных, если не пара тысяч».

Вероятное большое количество пленных подтверждают и двое бывших военнослужащих российской армии. «При спонтанном отступлении особенно много пленных. Связи внутри подразделений нет. Кто где находится, командиры не всегда знают. Соответственно, об отступлении не все могут знать», — говорят они. Бывший военнослужащий одного из элитных подразделений в разговоре с «Важными историями» отметил, что на Харьковском направлении обе стороны несут ощутимые потери. «Когда мои говорят: „Бля, там пиздец“, значит, что всё плохо», — добавил собеседник «Важных историй».

### **Почему провалилась российская оборона**

Несмотря на то, что в Харьковской области было сконцентрировано больше российских войск, чем задействовано сил ВСУ в контрнаступлении на этом участке, операция была направлена на особо уязвимые места, где возможности российских подразделений по обороне были истощены, говорит украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. «Российское командование знало, что у них есть уязвимые места в Харьковской области, они даже пытались их в значительной степени усилить. Знали, но предотвратить \[исход событий\] не могли: нехватка ресурсов уже начала сказываться на их возможностях по ведению обороны. И сейчас мы наблюдаем каскадный обвал обороны», — объясняет Александр Коваленко.

*   [ЗСУ вже на околицях окупованого Куп’янська](https://cripo.com.ua/news/war/zsu-vzhe-na-okolytsyah-okupovanogo-kup-yanska/ "Permalink to ЗСУ вже на околицях окупованого Куп’янська")
    

Российский военный эксперт Юрий Федоров говорит, что в Харьковской области украинская армия использовала новую тактику, которая и обеспечила успех на этом направлении. «ВСУ действуют очень динамично и фактически не задерживаются на то, чтобы штурмовать те или иные города. Они просто их обходят, берут в кольцо, и тогда гарнизоны этих городков и небольших сел просто вынуждены капитулировать, — рассказывает российский военный эксперт Юрий Федоров.

— Сейчас уже практически взят Купянск, по крайней мере, та часть, которая находится на правом берегу. Сдан Изюм или находится в процессе. Российские войска уходят оттуда, чтобы не попасть в окружение. Это, в общем, разумное решение, потому что коммуникации перерезаны. Сам по себе Изюм находится на стыке двух рек: Оскол и Северский Донец. Если его окружить, скажем, с северо-востока или с севера, то он просто будет отрезан от подвоза боеприпасов и всего прочего, и \[российская армия\] вынуждена будет капитулировать. Чтобы этого не случилось, они просто выводят войска, пока есть возможность».

Юрий Федоров считает, что ВСУ тактически и оперативно переиграли российские войска, которым не хватило ресурсов для сдерживания этого наступления. «\[Сначала\] была прорвана оборона в районе Балаклеи. А затем российские войска были разбросаны гарнизонами по различным городкам, селам. Эти гарнизоны часто состояли из Росгвардии, а также мобилизованных из так называемых народных республик.

Росгвардия в принципе воевать не умеет, она не для этого предназначена. Задача этих гарнизонов и гвардейских полков заключалась в том, чтобы держать в подчинении местное население. А среди мобилизованных многие в первый раз взяли в руки автомат, надели каску, мотивации \[у них нет\] никакой. Российские регулярные части были отведены частично на правобережье в Херсонскую область, частично на Донецкое направление, где они пытались штурмовать пригород Донецка, занятый ВСУ. Поэтому вот такой разгром», — объясняет военный эксперт.

Это же подтверждает в разговоре с «Важными историями» и российский военнослужащий, который был на этом направлении. «\[Подведомственные\] Минобороны \[войска\], группировка Восток, вышли с этого направления еще в июле в Белгородскую область. На тот момент в Изюме я встречал БАРСов (_боевой армейский резерв страны_ — **Прим. ред.**), ополченцев и войска ПВО Западного округа. После \[их\] выхода в Изюм зашёл СОБР и ОМОН. Соответственно, там действительно остались только „БАРСики“, ополченцы и Росгвардия», — говорит он.

По словам эксперта Федорова, российское командование просчиталось в оценке ситуации, когда перебросило боевые части с юга Харьковской области на другие направления до начала контрнаступления. «Считалось, что в районе расположения изюмской группировки ничего страшного случиться не может. Просчет заключался в том, что не была оценена вероятность того, что украинские войска начнут там наступление», — говорит Федоров.

«Российское командование с профессиональной точки зрения оценивают как очень слабое. Это люди, которые умеют бросать в бой значительное количество живой силы, но отсутствует инициатива в исполнении приказа. Написано „занять такой-то перекресток“, а может быть, лучше занять другой перекресток рядышком, но это недопустимая вещь, \[только\] тупое упорное выполнение приказа», — добавляет он.

«Нельзя, чтобы армия, которая строилась двадцать лет, сегодня такая: все, мы будем работать по-другому. Нас заставляли быть тупыми и не принимать никаких решений, — подтверждает бывший военнослужащий российской армии. — Попробуй сержанту скажи, что ты считаешь, что лучше вот так вот. Тебе ебало просто сломают, если не застрелят сразу. И так на всех уровнях. Верховный главнокомандующий принимает только „‎правильные“‎ решения — а все остальные должны их исполнять. И если что, они будут нести наказание, не потому что сверху долбоебы, а потому что „‎вы плохо \[приказы\] исполняете, вы не исполнительные“»‎, — говорит он.

![Український контрнаступ та звільнення міста Балаклія Харківської області та навколишніх сіл](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201280%20960'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

«Самые успешные операции за всю мою службу были те, о которых знали только мы. Только те люди, которые в ней участвуют. Потому что стоит таким заняться командованию… Поэтому когда мы сами решали, что делать, не ожидая команды сверху или пока качнут связь, чтобы уточнить, связаться, запросить разрешение на выполнение, уточнение и прочую херню, мы всегда все выполняли на 100 %», — отмечает бывший военнослужащий одного из элитных подразделений ВС РФ.

Накануне, 9 сентября, Минобороны [показало](https://t.me/mod_russia/19710)
 кадры переброски военной техники в Харьковскую область, но это подкрепление не помогло отстоять города. «Этих подкреплений крайне недостаточно, — говорит Юрий Федоров. — Даже вертолетами перебрасывали личный состав и легкую технику. Но это все равно, что пытаться из пипетки наполнить стакан, практически бессмысленная задача».

Александр Коваленко объясняет это тем, что переброска поддержки была лишь пропагандистским жестом. «Российской армии срочно понадобилось демонстрировать некую активность, что „помощь близка“, „мы своих не бросаем“, якобы они готовы оказывать поддержку тем подразделениям, которые оказались в сложной ситуации. Но эта переброска имела неорганизованный, хаотический характер, она не могла обеспечить никакой поддержки», — говорит эксперт.

По его словам, те подразделения, которые зашли в зону боевых действий для поддержки, были обречены. Многие из них давным-давно требовали ротации или вывода для восстановления боеспособности из-за понесенных до этого серьезных потерь. «В ближайшее время мы будем узнавать о большом количестве подразделений российской армии, которые попросту перестали существовать, поскольку вместо вывода на восстановление боеспособности их кинули в самую мясорубку, самое жерло боевых столкновений», — говорит он.

### **Чем российской армии грозит прорыв ВСУ**

Освобождение Купянска и Изюма важно в стратегическом смысле тем, что оно отрезает российские группировки от путей снабжения и открывает ВСУ путь на Луганское и Донецкое направление, говорит украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. «Эти города важны тем, что они являются неотъемлемой частью логистических артерий поставок техники, материально-технического обеспечения, боеприпасов, личного состава как в Харьковскую область, так и в целом на донбасский плацдарм. Купянск является очень важным логистическим узлом, сердцем этой артерии.

Через него шло обеспечение города Изюм, который стал центром сосредоточения самой большой бронетанковой группы российских оккупантов за все время полномасштабного вторжения в Украину, — говорит эксперт. — И вся эта масса должна была идти в сторону Славянска и Краматорска. Сейчас планы по захвату Славянска и Краматорска можно считать аннулированными. Потеря \[российской армией\] таких населенных пунктов как Купянск и Изюм полностью рушит систему обеспечения донбасского плацдарма и позволяет ВСУ в дальнейшем развивать контрнаступательные действия уже не только в Харьковской области, но и в Луганском и Донецком направлениях».

В ближайшие дни можно ожидать, что Харьковская область будет освобождена, уверен российский военный эксперт Юрий Федоров. «Это не решающее сражение, но очень крупный успех ВСУ», — говорит он. По его словам, тогда вооруженные силы Украины смогут перебросить значительное количество личного состава и на другие направления.

Херсонская область
------------------

### **Российской армии не хватает сил для обороны**

Еще одно не менее важное направление, на котором продолжают наступать силы ВСУ, — контролируемый российскими войсками плацдарм на правом берегу Днепра в Херсонской области. Украинское контрнаступление началось там 29 августа. В тот день, по [данным](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1018539645523163)
 оперативной группировки ВСУ «Каховка», ей удалось «прорвать первую линию обороны» в Херсонской области. «109 полк „ДНР“ отошел со своих позиций, российские десантники, которые были их поддержкой, сбежали с поля боя», — [говорилось](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1018539645523163)
 в сообщении. 4 сентября ВСУ [установили](https://www.facebook.com/kirill.timoshenko/posts/5588117717898633)
 украинский флаг в крупном населенном пункте Высокополье.

Точная численность российской группировки, которая находится на правом берегу Днепра, где Украина ведет контрнаступление, неизвестна. По разным оценкам, на начало контрнаступления там находилось от [20](https://www.currenttime.tv/a/ukraine-russia-war-kherson/31989285.html)
 до [25 тысяч](https://www.currenttime.tv/a/32011307.html)
 российских военных. Нет точных данных и о численности украинской группировки. Источник «Важных историй» из числа бывших сотрудников российской спецслужбы, пожелавший остаться анонимным, говорит, что для контрнаступления в Херсонской области Украина сформировала «довольно скромные резервы»: их численность — 10–12 тысяч человек.

Однако, по его словам, у Украины есть еще резервы, не брошенные в контрнаступление, которые не должны позволить российской стороне замкнуть окружение вокруг прорвавшихся вперед войск. Максимальную оценку украинских сил на этом фронте [приводит](https://www.currenttime.tv/a/rf-boitsya-poteryat-litso-i-poetomu-otdaet-svoih-soldat-na-myaso-na-pravom-beregu-dnepra-eksperty-o-rasklade-sil-na-yuge-ukrainy-/32011763.html)
 украинский военный эксперт Роман Свитан: по его данным, там находится 30 тысяч бойцов ВСУ.

«Теми силами, которые присутствуют сейчас на правом берегу Днепра, российская армия в среднесрочной перспективе не сможет удерживать контрнаступление ВСУ», — уверен украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. По словам аналитика Conflict Intelligence Team (CIT) Кирилла Михайлова, ВСУ удалось создать определенное превосходство в численности личного состава на основных направлениях наступления в Херсонской области. «К этому добавляется эффективная работа артиллерии и локальное превосходство Украины в воздухе, которое позволяет использовать как фронтовую авиацию, так и ударные беспилотники», — комментирует он расстановку сил.

По его словам, сейчас украинцы наступают в Херсонской области как минимум на трех направлениях: с запада; северо-запада, где они расширяют плацдарм на оккупированном \[Россией\] берегу реки Ингулец; и с севера, где им удалось взять крупный населенный пункт Высокополье и «затрофеить» большое количество военной техники российского десанта. На сегодня украинской армии удалось продвинуться на территорию более десяти населенных пунктов в Херсонской области, говорит Михайлов. «Хоть эти населенные пункты и небольшие, они являются оборонительными узлами. Пока мы видим преимущество на украинской стороне», — говорит он.

Нехватку ресурсов у российской группировки на этом направлении подтверждает и бывший сотрудник российской спецслужбы. «Из-за нехватки солдат и офицеров российские войска на фронте сосредоточены в недостаточном количестве. Людей примерно в три раза меньше, чем нужно для выполнения поставленных задач: требуется минимум одна батальонно-тактическая группа на 3 километра, а у России — одна на 5 километров. Такой численностью не наступают, это похоже на авантюру, — говорит он. — Прорвав первую линию \[обороны\] российских войск, украинское наступление должно было упереться во вторую линию, но проблема в том, что у российской военной группировки ее нет: из-за нехватки людей такие прорывы затыкают лишь мобильными резервами. И это может сделать ситуацию непредсказуемой».

Достоверных данных о потерях обеих сторон в этой схватке сейчас нет, говорит аналитик CIT Кирилл Михайлов, но судя по [публикации](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/09/04/ukraine-is-losing-fewer-soldiers-in-its-counter-offensive-than-russia-claims)
 The Economist (журналисты побывали в прифронтовом городе Николаеве, поговорили с местными врачами и не увидели там «переполненных моргов» с погибшими украинскими военными, о чем утверждает российская сторона), хоть потери украинской армии выросли с началом наступления, они не катастрофические, как это заявляет российское Минобороны. По словам бывшего сотрудника российской спецслужбы, с которым поговорили «Важные истории», потери украинской стороны высоки, потому что наступающая сторона всегда теряет больше обороняющейся.

На третий день контрнаступления в Херсонской области The Wall Street Journal [поговорила](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ukrainian-soldiers-say-they-are-advancing-in-the-south-but-at-a-cost-11661983338)
 в госпитале с ранеными украинскими солдатами, которые участвовали в операции. По их словам, бои на пути к Херсону идут крайне ожесточенные, но украинские войска продвигаются вперед. «У них много техники, но мало людей», — сказал один из украинских военных. Кроме этого, они утверждают, что некоторые российские солдаты бегут со своих позиций, бросая технику и устанавливая мины на телах погибших товарищей.

По словам одного из российских военнослужащих, который сейчас находится в Херсонской области, российская армия там находится в тяжелом положении, солдаты массово пытаются уволиться. «Две недели назад командиры нам сказали, что на нас наступление идет. А нам даже боеприпасы никак не привезти, потому что дамба разбита (_вероятно, речь идет о дамбе в Новой Каховке_ — **Прим. ред.**). Люди каждый день ходят с рапортами \[на увольнение\], но почти всем их разрывают», — написал он. Спустя две недели военный передал «Важным историям», что при обстреле чудом выжил, и «там все жестко».

Другой источник, близкий к российским военнослужащим, которые находятся на Херсонском направлении, передал, что солдаты в полном шоке, «никто ничего не понимает, гибнут пачками, потери ужасные. Некоторые вообще звонят, прощаются, мы, говорят, смертники ебучие».

### **У российской армии проблемы со снабжением**

Еще одна проблема российской группировки, которая должна сдерживать прорыв украинской армии в Херсонской области, заключается в том, что она оказалась отрезанной от всех основных путей снабжения. Ранее снабжение российской группировки на правом берегу Днепра происходило через мосты, по которым везли боеприпасы, технику, топливо и продовольствие с левого берега реки. Однако в результате ударов ВСУ все стационарные мосты через Днепр были выведены из строя, понтонные и паромные переправы постоянно подвергаются обстрелам.

«\[Исход этого противостояния на правом берегу Днепра\] зависит от того, удастся ли россиянам организовать поставки \[снабжения\] паромами, поскольку все постоянные мосты перестали функционировать. Наладить понтонные переправы через Днепр \[российской армии\] не удалось. Сейчас функционирует несколько паромных переправ — их украинцам тяжелее поражать, чем мосты, потому что паромы мобильны, сложно предугадать, где они находятся.

Однако периодически украинцы пытаются поражать скопление российской техники в местах ожидания паромов. Это должно вызывать значительные проблемы со снабжением. Насколько россиянам хватит ресурсов для противостояния, зависит от того, смогут ли они эффективно перебрасывать подкрепление, а также от того, сколько продержатся силы ВДВ, пока у них не закончится техника, которая не отличается бронированностью», — говорит аналитик CIT Кирилл Михайлов.

### **Чем России грозит продвижение ВСУ** 

Освобождение украинскими войсками населенного пункта Высокополье в Херсонской области 4 сентября сделало невозможным для российской армии ведение наступательных действий в направлении Кривого Рога в Днепропетровской области, говорит украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. «Это была крайняя северная точка, откуда россияне могли развернуть наступательную операцию в Криворожском направлении. В настоящее время эти возможности у них отсутствуют, — объясняет он.

— Кроме того, благодаря Высокополью ВСУ получили возможность расширить плацдарм в правобережной части Херсонской области и сформировать условия для контрнаступления на достаточно угрожающем участке для многих подразделений ВС РФ. Если ВСУ будут достаточно успешно развивать наступательные действия, то мы сможем говорить о том, что огромное количество российских подразделений может оказаться фактически в окружении».

Стратегический и политический смысл операции на Херсонском направлении для Украины в том, чтобы разгромить российскую группировку на правом берегу Днепра и освободить Херсон, считает аналитик CIT Кирилл Михайлов. «Это позволит задействовать экономические ресурсы области, а также продемонстрировать западным партнерам Украины \[поставщикам оружия\], что страна в состоянии наступать и выигрывать — нужно только больше \[поставок\] оружия.

Кроме этого, в долгосрочной перспективе ликвидация правобережного плацдарма устраняет перспективу наступления \[российской армии\] на Николаев, Кривой Рог и Одессу, потому что именно захват мостов и выход на правый берег Днепра был самым значительным успехом россиян на первом этапе операции. Ликвидация этого плацдарма сильно снижает угрозу всей правобережной Украине, в том числе западному Черноморью, которое критически важно для Украины с точки зрения, например, экспорта сельхозпродукции», — объясняет эксперт значимость операции на этом направлении.

Где еще наступают ВСУ и какая битва будет решающей
--------------------------------------------------

Кроме Херсонской и Харьковской областей, ВСУ осуществляют наступательные действия в Донецкой области, говорит украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. В частности освобожден населенный пункт Озерное в Донецкой области. «Аналогичные новости будут поступать и из Луганской области, где значительно активизировались ВСУ, воспользовавшись ослаблением российских подразделений после достаточно продолжительного воздействия на них огневым потенциалом», — уверен эксперт.

По мнению Коваленко, решающей для этой войны битвой станет контрнаступление украинской армии в Запорожской области. «Битва за правобережную Херсонщину — это очень важный промежуточный этап. После ее завершения и освобождения Херсона будет освобождена и значительная часть ресурсов ВСУ, которые были задействованы для сдерживания российских оккупантов и для ведения этой контрнаступательной операции. И эти ресурсы могут быть использованы на других направлениях: Запорожской, Харьковской, Донецкой и Луганской областях.

Они сыграют решающую роль в значительном ускорении, увеличении активности и интенсивности действий ВСУ. Для командования российских войск очень важно сохранять контроль именно над Запорожской областью. Ее потеря для россиян — это фактически выстрел в висок, поскольку это станет потерей всего юга, а потеря всего юга — это и потеря Крыма. Выйдя в Запорожскую область, ВСУ получат возможность блокировать Крым с материковой части Украины и нанести удары по Керченскому мосту — то есть отрезать его от материковой части России и начать операцию по освобождению Крыма», — говорит он.

«Что война проиграна, можно было легко судить, когда не получилось взять Киев. Плюс сейчас начинается слякоть, холода, потом зима. И такие простые вещи как теплая одежда, нормальная обувь и место для ночлега, будут влиять как на на здоровье, так и на отношение людей на фронте к войне, — говорит бывший российский военный. — Это трагичный конец, которого мы и ожидали. Война работает в обе стороны: за что боролись, на то и напоролись. В наше руководство я не верю, конечно. Как родина нас кидает, мы и так знаем. Уже кинула, начиная с 14-го \[года\] — заканчивая сегодня. Сами это дерьмо устроили, естественно, мы охуеть как насосемся теперь. Проблема в том, что мы изначально на проигравшей и некомпетентной стороне были. Родина сначала кинула мясом, а теперь бросила умирать. И у этого нет ни цели, ни мотива, никакой пользы никому — ни единому человеку».

1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that Poland held a military parade. However, the provided evidence does not confirm the date of the parade, nor does it mention any preparation for war with Russia. The articles were published in August 2023, not 2024.

The claim that the parade was on August 14, 2024, and that it was preparing for war with Russia is not supported by the evidence.

More information is needed to verify the date and the purpose of the parade.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

However, the claim incorrectly states the date as August 14, 2024, and falsely suggests the parade was preparation for war with Russia, which is not supported by the available evidence.
