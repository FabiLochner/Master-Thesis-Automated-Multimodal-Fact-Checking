Content: The Al Jazeera article discusses the London summit on Ukraine on March 2, 2025, and includes an image of European leaders. <image:5617> The image shows the leaders in suits.

The claim '<image:9> This is an authentic image of world leaders taking off their suits to symbolically support Ukraine at the London summit on Ukraine on March 2, 2025.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false.

So, the overall veracity is: false
