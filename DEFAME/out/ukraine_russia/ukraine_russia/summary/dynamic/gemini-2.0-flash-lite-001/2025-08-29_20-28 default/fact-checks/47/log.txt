The article also mentions that Charlie Hebdo released four different issues in March 2025. The source also provides links to other fact-checks about fabricated Charlie Hebdo covers.

Useful result: From [Source](https://without-lie.info/en/fake-with-another-fictional-cover-of-charlie-hebdo-magazine-with-a-caricature-of-the-president-of-ukraine/): 
Content: The search result from without-lie.info states that the Charlie Hebdo cover featuring Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a coffin is a fake. The article mentions the magazine's release date (March 20, 2025) and serial number (1705) and includes images of the fake cover <image:1> and the real cover. The article was published on March 23, 2025, and authored by Олександр Гороховський.

The claim '<image:14> This image shows a screenshot of an authentic Charlie Hebdo magazine cover from March 20, 2025 illustrating Ukrainian President Volodoymr Zelenskyy lying in a coffin and saying 'Ukraine is an independet state' in French.' is false.
Justification: The Charlie Hebdo cover depicting Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a coffin is a fabrication, as confirmed by multiple fact-checking sources, including Myth Detector ([https://mythdetector.com/en/coffin-was-not-published-by-charlie-hebdo/](https://mythdetector.com/en/coffin-was-not-published-by-charlie-hebdo/)) and without-lie.info ([https://without-lie.info/en/fake-with-another-fictional-cover-of-charlie-hebdo-magazine-with-a-caricature-of-the-president-of-ukraine/](https://without-lie.info/en/fake-with-another-fictional-cover-of-charlie-hebdo-magazine-with-a-caricature-of-the-president-of-ukraine/)), which identify the image as inauthentic.

So, the overall veracity is: false
