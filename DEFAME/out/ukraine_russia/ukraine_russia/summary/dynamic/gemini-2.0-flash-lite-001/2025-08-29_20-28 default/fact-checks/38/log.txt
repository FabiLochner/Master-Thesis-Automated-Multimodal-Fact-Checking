Useful result: From [Source](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/zelenskyys-meeting-harris-spat-trump-reveal-growing-partisan-divide-uk-rcna172648): 
Content: NBC News reports that Zelenskyy visited a munitions factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania, which some Republicans viewed as a signal of which way he wants the November election to go.

Useful result: From [Source](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/harris-standing-zelenskyy-indirectly-jabs-trump-vance-ukraine/story?id=114219628): 
Content: The ABC News article, published on September 26, 2024, reports on Vice President Kamala Harris meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to discuss the war with Russia. <image:1>, <image:2061>. The article mentions Zelenskyy's visit to Washington and his meetings with U.S. lawmakers.

The claim 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy engaged in election interference by campaigning in Pennsylvania for Kamala Harris ahead of the US presidential election in 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not directly supported by the evidence. While there is evidence of Volodymyr Zelenskyy's visit to a munitions plant in Pennsylvania and meetings with U.S. officials, there is no direct evidence of him campaigning for Kamala Harris. Newsweek reports that JD Vance accused Zelenskyy of campaigning for Harris, and NBC News states that Zelenskyy's visit was viewed by some Republicans as a signal of his preference. However, these actions do not equate to campaigning.

So, the overall veracity is: false
