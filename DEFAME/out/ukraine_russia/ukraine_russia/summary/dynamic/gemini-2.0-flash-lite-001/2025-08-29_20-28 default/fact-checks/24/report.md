### Evidence from `web_search`
Howard Buffett's foundation has provided significant aid to Ukraine. According to [Alliance magazine](https://www.alliancemagazine.org/blog/howard-buffett-maintains-ukraine-philanthropy-despite-deteriorating-us-support/), the foundation aims to surpass $1 billion in giving this year. [Fortune](https://fortune.com/2025/04/07/warren-buffetts-son-is-on-track-to-donate-1-billion-in-aid-to-ukraine-this-year-and-pledges-to-continue-despite-trumps-shaky-relations/) reports that Howard Buffett's foundation has contributed about $800 million to Ukraine since the start of the full-scale invasion <image:k>.

[Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/howard-buffett-gives-500-million-to-ukraine) states that Howard Buffett's foundation has given $520 million to Ukraine in humanitarian aid ![image 508](media/2025-08-06_17-43-1754502221-865316.jpg).


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Howard Buffett's foundation, not Warren Buffett, has donated to Ukraine. Specifically, the foundation has provided approximately $800 million since the start of the full-scale invasion, and aims to surpass $1 billion in giving this year. One source states that the foundation has given $520 million in humanitarian aid.

The claim is about Warren Buffett, but the evidence focuses on Howard Buffett's philanthropic efforts.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The evidence shows that Howard Buffett's foundation, not Warren Buffett, has donated to Ukraine. The foundation has provided significant aid, with amounts cited ranging from $520 million to $800 million.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While Howard Buffett's foundation has donated significant aid to Ukraine, with amounts cited ranging from $520 million to $800 million, the claim attributes these donations to Warren Buffett.
