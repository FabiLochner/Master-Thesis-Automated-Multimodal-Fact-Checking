## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that JD Vance accused Volodymyr Zelenskyy of campaigning for Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential race. NBC News reports that Zelenskyy's visit to a munitions factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania, was viewed by some Republicans as a signal of his preference in the November election. ABC News mentions a meeting between Kamala Harris and Zelenskyy.

The evidence does not explicitly state that Zelenskyy campaigned for Harris. It does mention a visit to a munitions plant in Pennsylvania, which some Republicans interpreted as a signal of preference.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported. While there is evidence of Zelenskyy's actions and perceptions of his actions, there is no direct evidence of campaigning.


## Final Judgement
The claim that Volodymyr Zelenskyy engaged in election interference by campaigning for Kamala Harris is not directly supported by the evidence. While there is evidence of Zelenskyy's visit to a munitions plant in Pennsylvania and meetings with U.S. officials, there is no direct evidence of campaigning for Harris. The evidence suggests that some Republicans viewed his actions as a signal of preference, but this does not equate to campaigning.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is not directly supported by the evidence. While there is evidence of Volodymyr Zelenskyy's visit to a munitions plant in Pennsylvania and meetings with U.S. officials, there is no direct evidence of him campaigning for Kamala Harris. Newsweek reports that JD Vance accused Zelenskyy of campaigning for Harris, and NBC News states that Zelenskyy's visit was viewed by some Republicans as a signal of his preference. However, these actions do not equate to campaigning.
