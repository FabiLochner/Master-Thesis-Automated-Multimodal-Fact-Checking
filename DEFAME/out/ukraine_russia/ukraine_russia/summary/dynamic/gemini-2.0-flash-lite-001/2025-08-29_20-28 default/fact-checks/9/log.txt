Useful result: From [Source](https://telegrafi.com/en/zelensky-on-a-rare-trip-outside-kiev-visited-the-front-line-where-he-met-ukrainian-troops/): Found exact image on website with title: Zelensky, on a rare trip outside Kiev, visited the front line where he ...
Content: The article from Telegrafi.com discusses a rare trip of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky outside of Kyiv, where he visited the front line in the Kharkiv region and met with Ukrainian troops. The article includes an image of Zelensky with soldiers <image:1662>. The article was published 3 years ago.

The claim '<image:7> This image shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky arriving in August 2024 in the Sudzha of Kursk region, Russia, which had just been occupied by Ukrainian troops in the Kursk Offensive, and meeting with representatives of the people there.' is false.
Justification: The claim is partially accurate. According to a CNN report, Ukrainian forces took control of Sudzha in August 2024, and the BBC and Meduza articles mention the Kursk Offensive and Sudzha, supporting the possibility of Zelensky visiting the area at that time. However, the evidence does not verify whether Zelensky met with representatives of the people, making the claim only partially accurate.

So, the overall veracity is: false
