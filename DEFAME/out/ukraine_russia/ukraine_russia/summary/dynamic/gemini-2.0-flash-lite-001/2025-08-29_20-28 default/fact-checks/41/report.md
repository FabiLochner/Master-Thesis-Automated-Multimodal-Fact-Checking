Sky News ([https://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-war-latest-russia-rape-putin-zelenskyy-12541713](https://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-war-latest-russia-rape-putin-zelenskyy-12541713)) reports on the ongoing Ukraine war, mentioning meetings and calls between various leaders.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022. The provided sources do not support the claim that Zelenskyy initiated the war.

The Al Jazeera article specifically addresses the claim that Ukraine started the war, which contradicts the claim. The other sources mention Zelenskyy's presidency and the ongoing war but do not provide evidence to support the claim.

To verify the claim, more information is needed about the events leading up to the 2022 invasion and any actions taken by Zelenskyy that could be interpreted as starting the war.


## Final Judgement
The search results show that Russia initiated the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The provided sources do not support the claim that Zelenskyy started the war. The Al Jazeera article directly contradicts the claim.
