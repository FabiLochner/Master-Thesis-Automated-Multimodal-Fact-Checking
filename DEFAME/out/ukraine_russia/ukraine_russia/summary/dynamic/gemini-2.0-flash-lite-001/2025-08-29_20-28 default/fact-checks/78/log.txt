Useful result: From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kursk_campaign): 
Content: The Wikipedia article discusses the 2024 Kursk offensive, which began on August 6, 2024, as part of the Russo-Ukrainian War. <image:26> The Armed Forces of Ukraine launched an incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast, clashing with Russian forces. The article mentions the involvement of Ukrainian, Russian, and North Korean forces, and provides casualty figures from both sides. The incursion led to a state of emergency in Kursk Oblast and the postponement of elections in the region. The article also mentions the destruction of bridges and the capture of settlements.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0q198zyppqo): 
Content: The BBC article, published on March 17, 2025, discusses the retreat of Ukrainian troops from the Kursk region. The article mentions that the roads were littered with destroyed military equipment. <image:5984>, <image:5989>, <image:5993>. The article includes a map showing the Ukrainian advance in August 2024 and the Russian control in March 2025. <image:5987>.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-says-it-pummelled-ukrainian-forces-along-kursk-front-2024-08-26/): 
Content: The Reuters article, published on August 26, 2024, discusses the conflict in the Kursk region of Russia, where Ukraine has made incursions. The article mentions that Russia claims to have struck Ukrainian forces in the area and that Ukraine has lost 73 tanks, 61 armored personnel carriers, and 404 armored combat vehicles. <image:5994> shows a crossing point on the border with Russia in the Sumy region.

The claim '<image:26> This image shows destroyed Ukrainian tanks during Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024.' is false.
Justification: The image in the claim, showing destroyed tanks, is associated with the conflict in the Kursk region during August 2024, as confirmed by the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kursk_campaign) and the [Reuters article](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-says-it-pummelled-ukrainian-forces-along-kursk-front-2024-08-26/). While the evidence supports the presence of destroyed military equipment and Ukrainian incursions, it does not definitively confirm that the tanks in the image are Ukrainian.

So, the overall veracity is: false
