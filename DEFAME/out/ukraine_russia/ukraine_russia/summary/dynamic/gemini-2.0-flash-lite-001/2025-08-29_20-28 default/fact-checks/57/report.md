## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The University of California, Berkeley, reported on an AI-generated audio of Donald Trump criticizing Keir Starmer, overlaid on a video interview with Theo Von on August 21, 2024; neither Trump nor Von discussed the UK or Ukraine in the original video ([https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/news/2025/hany-farid-discusses-circulating-trump-video-criticizing-keir-starmer](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/news/2025/hany-farid-discusses-circulating-trump-video-criticizing-keir-starmer)). Yahoo News mentions Theo Von's podcast "This Past Weekend" and that Trump was on the podcast last year (![image 5881](media/2025-08-29_20-39-1756499958-380494.jpg), ![image 5882](media/2025-08-29_20-39-1756499961-537524.jpg)). The Independent reported that Trump criticized European leaders, including Keir Starmer, regarding their talks over Ukraine, and also mentioned Starmer's efforts to act as a bridge between America and Europe (![image 5884](media/2025-08-29_20-39-1756499970-391887.jpg), ![image 5883](media/2025-08-29_20-39-1756499969-997712.jpg), ![image 5885](media/2025-08-29_20-39-1756499970-936793.jpg)) ([https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/donald-trump-keir-starmer-ukraine-tirade-b2708208.html](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/donald-trump-keir-starmer-ukraine-tirade-b2708208.html)).


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that an AI-generated audio of Trump criticizing Keir Starmer was overlaid on a video interview with Theo Von on August 21, 2024, but the original video did not discuss the UK or Ukraine ([https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/news/2025/hany-farid-discusses-circulating-trump-video-criticizing-keir-starmer](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/news/2025/hany-farid-discusses-circulating-trump-video-criticizing-keir-starmer)). However, The Independent reported that Trump criticized Keir Starmer regarding Ukraine ([https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/donald-trump-keir-starmer-ukraine-tirade-b2708208.html]).

The evidence does not explicitly confirm that Trump criticized Starmer over a 100-year deal between the U.K. and Ukraine.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported, as Trump did criticize Starmer regarding Ukraine, but the specific context of a 100-year deal is not confirmed.


## Final Judgement
The claim is partially supported. While Trump did criticize Keir Starmer regarding Ukraine, the evidence does not confirm that the criticism was specifically about a 100-year deal between the U.K. and Ukraine.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is partially supported. While Donald Trump did criticize Keir Starmer regarding Ukraine, as reported by The Independent ([https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/donald-trump-keir-starmer-ukraine-tirade-b2708208.html](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/donald-trump-keir-starmer-ukraine-tirade-b2708208.html)), the evidence does not confirm that the criticism was specifically about a 100-year deal between the U.K. and Ukraine, nor does it confirm that the interview took place in August 2024.
