## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Russia Matters article from February 26, 2025, estimates over 700,000 Russian soldiers killed or injured as of January 2025. <image:k> It also mentions Donald Trump's estimate of 1 million Russian soldiers killed in January 2025.

The Wikipedia article "Casualties of the Russo-Ukrainian War" states that a British Army official estimated 1.5 to 1.8 million Russian casualties by July 2024. By the end of 2024, Meduza estimated over 165,000 Russian soldiers had died. As of early February 2025, 1,382 Russian servicemen were confirmed in Ukrainian captivity.

Mediazona, in collaboration with BBC News Russian service, provides information on Russian losses, with the last update of the Probate Registry estimate on February 24, 2025, as of December 2024. [Source](https://en.zona.media/article/2025/08/01/casualties_eng-trl)


## Elaboration
The evidence presents conflicting information regarding Russian troop losses. The Russia Matters article from February 26, 2025, estimates over 700,000 Russian soldiers killed or injured as of January 2025, while Donald Trump estimated 1 million Russian soldiers killed in January 2025. The Wikipedia article mentions a British Army official's estimate of 1.5 to 1.8 million Russian casualties by July 2024.

The claim of 1.5 million troop losses by February 2025 is not directly supported by the evidence. While the Wikipedia article mentions estimates that approach this number, they are for earlier dates (July 2024) and include casualties, not just losses. The other sources provide different figures for different timeframes, making it difficult to verify the claim.

To verify the claim, more specific data on Russian troop losses, including the definition of "loss" (killed, wounded, missing, captured), and the exact timeframe (February 2025) would be needed.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://en.zona.media/article/2025/08/29/casualties_eng-trl): 
Content: The Mediazona article, updated on August 29, 2025, estimates that around 220,000 Russian men between 18 and 55 had been killed in the war by August 2025. The article also mentions a peak of approximately 3,000 deaths per week in November 2024.


## Elaboration
The new evidence from Mediazona, updated on August 29, 2025, estimates around 220,000 Russian men killed in the war by August 2025. This figure is significantly lower than the claimed 1.5 million troop losses by February 2025.

The evidence does not support the claim. The provided figures are for a later date (August 2025) and refer only to deaths, not total losses.


## Final Judgement
The initial search revealed conflicting information and estimates for Russian casualties, but none that specifically supported the claim of 1.5 million troop losses by February 2025. The additional search provided an estimate of 220,000 Russian deaths by August 2025, which is significantly lower and doesn't align with the claim.

The claim is demonstrably false because the available evidence, including the most recent data, does not support the figure of 1.5 million troop losses by February 2025. The evidence provides significantly lower figures and different metrics (deaths vs. losses). `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim that Russia lost 1.5 million troops in the Ukraine war by February 2025 is demonstrably false. While estimates of casualties exist, such as the British Army official's estimate of 1.5 to 1.8 million casualties by July 2024 ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War)), these figures do not align with the claim's timeframe or definition of "losses." Furthermore, a Mediazona article from August 29, 2025, estimates around 220,000 Russian deaths by August 2025 ([Mediazona](https://en.zona.media/article/2025/08/29/casualties_eng-trl)), which is significantly lower than the claimed figure.
