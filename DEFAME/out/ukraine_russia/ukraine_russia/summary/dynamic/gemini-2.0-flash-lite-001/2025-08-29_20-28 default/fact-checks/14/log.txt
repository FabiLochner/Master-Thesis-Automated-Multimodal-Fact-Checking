Content: The article from gwaramedia.com debunks a claim that Fox News published an article stating that the "Psychological and Information Warfare Center of Ukraine" received $140,000,000 per month from USAID.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-disinformation-spikes-after-trump-zelenskyy-row/a-71832118): 
Content: The DW article fact-checks a claim that Fox News reported USAID pays $140 million per month to Ukraine's Psychological and Information Warfare Center. The article states that a manipulated screenshot of a Fox News article is circulating on social media. The article states that the US Congress appropriated $182.75 billion for Ukraine-related efforts between 2022 and 2024, with USAID's share being approximately $39.9 billion. The article states that there was no mention of a $140-million-per-month disbursement to a "Psychological and Information Warfare Center." The article also mentions that the "psychological operations unit" is part of Ukraine's Special Operations Forces (SOF). <image:11>

It was established in 2003 and is currently headquartered in Kyiv. The center has been involved in the Russo-Ukrainian War and the Syrian Civil War. The article also mentions the center's structure, commanders, and history, including its capture by Russian forces in Crimea in 2014. <image:11>
