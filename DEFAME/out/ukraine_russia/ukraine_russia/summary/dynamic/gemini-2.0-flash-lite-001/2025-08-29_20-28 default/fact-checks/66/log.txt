Useful result: From [Source](https://www.mofa.go.jp/region/europe/russia/russia_policy.html): 
Content: The provided document, "Japan's Policy on the Russian Federation" from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan, outlines Japan's objectives regarding Russia. These include resolving the Northern Territories issue, normalizing relations, and providing assistance for Russia's reforms. The document mentions political dialogues and exchanges between Japan and Russia, including meetings and agreements related to security and defense. It also highlights Japan's contributions to enhancing safety in the Russian nuclear power industry.

The claim 'China and Japan plan to invade the Russian Federation.' is false.
Justification: The evidence indicates increasing military cooperation between China and Russia, with Japan expressing security concerns, as reported by [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/china-russia-drills-trump-2108410) and CEPA. While there are mentions of strained relations between Japan and Russia, including leaked documents about potential attacks, there is no evidence to support the claim that China and Japan plan to invade Russia.

So, the overall veracity is: false
