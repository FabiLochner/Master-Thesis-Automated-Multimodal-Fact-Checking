## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The provided sources describe a contentious meeting between Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trump at the White House on February 28, 2025. According to a Wikipedia article, the meeting involved Donald Trump, JD Vance, and Volodymyr Zelenskyy. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Trump%E2%80%93Zelenskyy_Oval_Office_meeting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Trump%E2%80%93Zelenskyy_Oval_Office_meeting)) <image:i>. NPR reported that the visit ended abruptly after an "Oval Office spat" and that Zelenskyy was there to finalize a deal on minerals. ([https://www.npr.org/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5312076/zelenskyys-visit-to-the-white-house-ends-abruptly-after-oval-office-spat](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5312076/zelenskyys-visit-to-the-white-house-ends-abruptly-after-oval-office-spat)) ![image 517](media/2025-08-06_17-46-1754502406-548910.jpg).

Al Jazeera also covered the meeting, highlighting disagreements over a deal for Ukraine's rare earth minerals and security assurances. ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/28/key-takeaways-from-the-fiery-white-house-meeting-with-trump-and-zelenskyy](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/28/key-takeaways-from-the-fiery-white-house-meeting-with-trump-and-zelenskyy)) <image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>. However, none of the sources mention Zelenskyy stating that the U.S. would have to send their sons and daughters to die for Ukraine.


### Evidence from `web_search`
Multiple sources, including Yahoo News ([Source](https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-zelenskyy-saying-us-120000537.html)), VOA News ([Source](https://www.voanews.com/a/no-zelenskyy-did-not-say-american-sons-and-daughters-will-have-to-die-in-ukraine/6993247.html)), and CNN ([Source](https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/02/politics/fact-check-zelensky-americans-fighting-ukraine-video)), report that Zelenskyy did not say the U.S. would have to send their sons and daughters to die for Ukraine. Instead, his comments, taken out of context, referred to a hypothetical scenario where a loss for Ukraine could lead to a broader conflict involving the U.S. ![image 1](media/0.jpg), <image:k>, ![image 522](media/2025-08-06_17-47-1754502436-263202.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the claim is false. While there was a contentious meeting between Zelenskyy and Trump at the White House in February 2025, the provided sources do not support the assertion that Zelenskyy made the statement in question. Furthermore, multiple fact-checking sources explicitly state that Zelenskyy did not make such a statement.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that while there was a meeting between Zelenskyy and Trump in February 2025, there is no evidence to support the claim that Zelenskyy said the U.S. would have to send their sons and daughters to die for Ukraine. Multiple sources confirm that Zelenskyy did not make this statement.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While there was a meeting between Zelenskyy and Trump in February 2025, there is no evidence to support the claim that Zelenskyy said the U.S. would have to send their sons and daughters to die for Ukraine. Multiple fact-checking sources, such as [Yahoo News](https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-zelenskyy-saying-us-120000537.html), [VOA News](https://www.voanews.com/a/no-zelenskyy-did-not-say-american-sons-and-daughters-will-have-to-die-in-ukraine/6993247.html), and [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/02/politics/fact-check-zelensky-americans-fighting-ukraine-video), confirm that Zelenskyy did not make this statement.
