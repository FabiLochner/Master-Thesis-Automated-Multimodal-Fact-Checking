On March 16, a cover of the British daily newspaper Hull Daily Mail was actively shared on Russian- and [Georgian-language](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid0g1GfY7Z4aGG2xGcbGWwFUMDyp5zv6Kn2tu9X8RujD2idboESUuMpueFeNq52AMPMl&id=100003712160160)

) The image features the following caption: “_70,000 Ukrainian soldiers in the Kursk region died in vain.”_ According to the date shown on the image, this issue was supposedly published on March 13, 2025. Additionally, no such visual appears on the publication’s official [website](https://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/)
 or social media pages [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/hulllive/)

).

The actual [cover](https://www.pressreader.com/newspapers/n/hull-daily-mail/20250313)
 of the March 13 issue does not mention Ukraine at all, while the main headline of the issue reads: “Boy found guilty of attempting to murder a girl with a sword.”

The newspaper did not use such a cover on March 13 or any other day.**

 the Armed Forces’ control and thanked Ukrainian troops for Kursk operation, the information about a new cover for British _Hull Daily Mail_ spread online. 

The сover for the new issue — extensively discussed on Telegram — had a headline saying almost 70 thousand (**UPD**: 70,000, not 200,000) Ukrainian soldiers died in Russia’s Kursk region. It is a fake cover.

What happened?
--------------

Since March 15, 2025, this cover has been published on Telegram channels that regularly spread Russian propaganda, e.g., Ramzai (“Рамзай”, [archive](https://archive.ph/lbZQC)
), Tsarhrad TV (Царьград ТВ, [archive](https://archive.ph/kFuzl)
), V Рука Кремля Z ([archive](https://archive.ph/S6ojC)
), web-resources like Russian spring (Русская весна, [archive](https://archive.ph/vGRJh)
), Politikus (“Політікус,” [archive](https://archive.ph/evraz)
), and on X accounts ([1](https://archive.ph/Oq0sF)
,[2](https://archive.ph/TEjv8)
,[3](https://archive.ph/Fj0XG)
). 

The posts included a cover of the British regional daily newspaper of _Hull Daily Mail_ with the following text: 

!Telegram posts and other pro-Russian sources posting fake Hull Daily Mail cover about 70,000 Ukrainian soldiers dying in Kursk  <image:1452>

Telegram posts and other pro-Russian sources posting fake Hull Daily Mail cover about 70,000 Ukrainian soldiers dying in Kursk

“70,000 Ukrainian soldiers in Kursk Oblast died in vain. The victim managed to survive, so the defendant was found guilty of the attempted murder. 

So, the “news” about British outlet _Hull Daily Mail_ writing about 70,000 Ukrainian soldiers dying in Russia’s Kursk region is another fake, aimed at the accreditation of allied countries providing Ukraine with aid among Russian-speaking audiences. 

Conclusion: Fake

A WIDELY CIRCULATED image of a UK local newspaper front page containing the headline “70,000 Ukrainian soldiers in the Kursk region died in vain” is fake.

The supposed front page of the Hull Daily Mail – a local newspaper in England – from Thursday, 13 March was shared widely across social media by multiple accounts.

[Multiple examples](https://www.facebook.com/okoro.austine.1/posts/pfbid0CP3sHF7i9DmTrMjun8LADctWJoPfACeJ3b9DbeLMNfn28vJTYL6orp2p8XQ7UE5il)

 containing the doctored image can be found on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/TinhCaTayBac1979/posts/pfbid0854v3LXb6u4gqFi229CbiPTjwqbtSX3UTXaR2LSGqjKea4biRFL8H7cyLxr1CecVl)
 and [X](https://x.com/DD_Geopolitics/status/1900999961350901999)
, where they have been liked and shared thousands of times. The posts have been shared by figures with links to Russia and who have previously spread disinformation.

The image beneath the fake headline shows one soldier comforting another, with a sub-headline saying: “The UK poured hundreds of millions of pounds into Zelensky’s crushing failure”.

The fake headline references recent battles in the Kursk region of Russia as part of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. Ukraine launched an offensive into the Kursk region last year in retaliation for an invasion that has seen Russian troops occupy swathes of southern and eastern Ukraine.

However, Ukrainian forces have recently come under intense pressure from Russian forces there, and there have been many reports of soldiers having to retreat from the region.

But the Hull Daily Mail headline describing the conflict in Kursk is fake. 

“That story re Ukraine was a fake,” Lija Kresowaty, a spokesperson for Reach PLC, the Hull Daily Mail’s parent company, [told AFP News](https://www.yahoo.com/news/fake-newspaper-cover-ukrainian-soldiers-180125785.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAAVEWlsU32-KZuLxBFOD9WpKhOeQNx4Q7ZCMt2Oci-U2kfjiYWf0WdSLBOwmdFhk7qKgCcdyqUViu3und3fjSmLvm3XeH6ZLYDaVcp3wr35Nzao2wcRRZiqX_AgkT7MqwPM3VHIb3ORXTiyNH1CnF0dSNHy8PZS45d87r-DeSxBJ)
.

[A copy of the front page from 13 March](https://penrithcity.spydus.com/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/WPAC/ISSENQ?SETLVL=&ISX=142144)
, held by the Penrith City Library, shows a different front page from the one circulated, as does the Press Reader website (which features archives of dozens of regional and national newspapers).

“Boy found guilty of attempting to murder girl with a sword,” the front-page text reads in the real edition of the Hull Daily Mail from that date.

It describes a Halloween camping in which a young teenager is alleged to have been stabbed ten times.

It is unclear where the 70,000 figure used in the fake post about Ukraine came from. <image:1472>](https://www.thejournal.ie/author/cormac-fitzgerald/3970/)

At the time of writing, just before Russia retook Sudzha, Volodymyr said Ukrainian forces were being pressed from three sides.

Maksym: Vehicle wrecks litter the roads
---------------------------------------

By 11 March, Ukrainian forces were battling to prevent the road being cut, according to Telegram messages from "Maksym".

"A few days ago, we received an order to leave the defence lines in an organised retreat," he said, adding that Russia had amassed a significant force to retake the town, "including large numbers of North Korean soldiers".

Military experts estimate Russia had amassed a force of up to 70,000 troops to retake Kursk – including about 12,000 North Koreans.

Russia had also sent its best drone units to the front and was using kamikaze and first-person-view (FPV) variants to "take fire control of the main logistics routes".

They included drones linked to operators by fibre-optic wires - which are impossible to jam with electronic counter-measures.

Maksym said as a result "the enemy managed to destroy dozens of units of equipment", and that wrecks had "created congestion on supply routes".

What now for Ukraine's offensive?
---------------------------------

Ukraine's top general, Oleksandr Syrskyi, insists that Ukrainian forces have pulled back to "more favourable positions", remain in Kursk, and would do so "for as long as it is expedient and necessary".

He said Russia had suffered more than 50,000 losses during the operation - including those killed, injured or captured.

However, the situation now is very different to last August. Military analysts estimate two-thirds of the 1,000 sq km gained at the outset have since been lost.

Any hopes that Ukraine would be able to trade Kursk territory for some of its own have significantly diminished.

Last week, President Volodymyr Zelensky said he believed the Kursk operation had "accomplished its task" by forcing Russia to pull troops from the east and relieve pressure on Pokrovsk.

But it is not yet clear at what cost.

Volodymyr: 'Drones around the clock'
------------------------------------

On 9 March, "Volodymyr" sent a Telegram post to the BBC saying he was still in Sudzha, where there was "panic and collapse of the front".

Ukrainian troops "are trying to leave - columns of troops and equipment. <image:5585>!Map showing the region of Sudzha in August 2024, controlled by Ukraine and on 16 March 2025, under Russian control <image:5588>

Volodymyr said it was possible to travel on that road relatively safely a month ago. There is no point in keeping it any more".

Western officials estimate that Ukraine's Kursk offensive involved about 12,000 troops.

A Ukrainian soldier comforts a comrade during fighting in Kursk

Ukrainian soldiers fighting in Russia's Kursk region have described scenes "like a horror movie" as they retreated from the front lines.

The BBC has received extensive accounts from Ukrainian troops, who recount a "catastrophic" withdrawal in the face of heavy fire, and columns of military equipment destroyed and constant attacks from swarms of Russian drones.

The soldiers, who spoke over social media, were given aliases to protect their identity. Some gave accounts of a "collapse" as Ukraine lost Sudzha, the largest town it held.

Ukrainian restrictions on travel to the front have meant it is not possible to get a full picture of the situation. It is impossible to leave during the day."

Movement of men, logistics and equipment had been reliant on one major route between Sudzha and Ukraine's Sumy region.

A costly gamble Meduza analyzes Russia’s Kursk counteroffensive and what losing Sudzha means for Ukraine
========================================================================================================

7:24 pm, March 17, 2025

![Russian servicemen in the Kursk region with a captured M777 howitzer. Meduza analyzes how Russia’s counteroffensive in the Kursk region unfolded and what losing its foothold in Sudzha means for Ukraine.

### What happened during Russia’s rapid advance in the Kursk region?

On March 8, Russian forces launched a new phase of their offensive to take back Ukraine’s foothold in the Kursk region. President Donald Trump’s [statement](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114161039436456514)
 to that effect last Friday — apparently based on Putin’s [claims](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/15/europe/zelensky-putin-kursk-encircle-russia-ukraine-intl/index.html)
.

### Why did Ukraine launch the Kursk operation, and what did it achieve?

How Ukraine’s incursion into the Kursk region unfolded — and how Russia’s counteroffensive developed

Meduza

As early as 2022, an unusual situation had taken shape along the front line — it was distinctly divided into two sections of nearly equal length:

*   **An active front**, stretching from the northeastern Kharkiv region to the mouth of the Dnipro River, where most forces were concentrated and both sides traded offensives and strikes
*   **A passive front**, running from the junction of Ukraine’s borders with Belarus and Poland to Kharkiv, following the Belarusian-Ukrainian and Russian-Ukrainian borders

Both sides conducted cross-border raids — Russia [using](https://t.me/dva_majors/35315)
 GRU special forces, while Ukraine deployed larger units under the Main Intelligence Directorate. The main rationale became President Volodymyr Zelensky’s publicly stated goal of exchanging Russian-held territory in Kursk region for parts of Ukraine occupied by Russia. President Volodymyr Zelensky had repeatedly [said](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/11/zelenskyy-europe-cannot-guarantee-ukraines-security-without-america)
 the goal was to use occupied territory as leverage for a future exchange, but now Kyiv has nothing left to trade. For seven months, Ukraine’s presence in the region tied down a large Russian force, but Kyiv also committed some of its most battle-ready brigades to Sudzha — troops that might have been used more effectively had they withdrawn as soon as Russia launched its counteroffensive in the fall. Another supply route south of Sudzha was also severed by Russian forces.

On the first day of the renewed offensive, Russian units struck north of Sudzha, effectively isolating the entire northern part of the bridgehead from the city. It was there, between the Sudzha–Kursk and Sudzha–Lgov roads, that Russian forward units emerged from a [gas pipeline](https://meduza.io/en/feature/2025/03/10/russian-troops-reportedly-spent-days-crawling-through-gas-pipeline-to-slip-behind-ukrainian-lines-in-kursk-region)

By the evening of March 8, Ukrainian forces had lost key defensive positions north of Sudzha, including Malaya Loknya and Martynovka. Ukrainian troops suffered heavy losses during their hasty retreat from the northern part of the bridgehead.

At the same time, Russian forces launched an offensive on Sudzha’s eastern districts."

CNN  — 

Ukrainian President [Volodymyr Zelensky](https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/11/world/ukraine-zelensky-confirms-russian-incursion-intl/index.html)
 said on Thursday that Ukrainian forces have taken control of the Russian town of Sudzha, over a week after his forces launched a [cross-border incursion](https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/10/europe/ukraine-putin-embarrasses-surprise-assault-analysis-intl/index.html)
 into Russia’s Kursk region.

Kyiv’s forces have been in the town, located 105 kilometers (65 miles) southwest of the city of Kursk, since last Wednesday, but this is the first confirmation from the Ukrainian president that his army had captured it.

Ukrainian military chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said Ukrainian troops have advanced 35 kilometers (21.7 miles) through Russian defenses since the start of their surprise assault, capturing 1,150 square kilometers of territory and 82 settlements.

Syrskyi said a military commandant’s office has been set up in Sudzha “to maintain law and order and meet the priority needs of the population in the controlled territories.”

Sudzha is located next to a Russian gas terminal, a key point for supplying gas from Russia, via Ukraine, to Europe. A source in Ukraine’s security service told CNN the attack targeted four bases in the southwest regions of Kursk and Voronezh, and Nizhny Novgorod, east of Moscow.

Russia’s defense ministry said it destroyed 117 “aircraft-type” drones and four tactical missiles over Kursk and neighboring regions.

Ukraine’s assault – which poses [a major embarrassment](https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/13/europe/ukraine-incursion-russia-analysis-intl/index.html)
 for the Kremlin – represents a notable change in tactics for Kyiv, marking the first time foreign troops have entered Russian territory since World War II.

Russia has pulled reserves from key battleground areas in Ukraine and Russian-occupied Crimea to repel Kyiv’s advances, a Ukrainian military commander told CNN Wednesday.

The Russian Ministry of Defense claimed in an update posted on Telegram Thursday to have recaptured the first village from Ukrainian forces in Kursk region – the settlement of Krupets.

Russian President Vladimir Putin vowed on Monday to “kick the enemy out” of Russia after it emerged that dozens of Russian villages were under Ukrainian control.

Ukraine meanwhile continues its struggle along the eastern front, where Russian forces have been making incremental gains for months."

    Russian rockets are devastating large areas of eastern Ukraine
    
    Russia is reported to have fired its latest multiple-rocket system against Ukrainian targets in the Kharkiv area – a weapon described as a giant flamethrower.
    
    That is what a Russian security official told the state-run Tass news agency. It has not been confirmed officially.
    
    The TOS-2 Tosochka is a thermobaric fuel-air weapon: it creates massive explosions by igniting gas clouds on impact, depriving anyone in the area of oxygen.
    
    Ukraine has pushed Russian forces back from the outskirts of Kharkiv, the second city, which was visited by President Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday.
    
    Earlier Russia confirmed that it was using TOS-1 Solntsepyok (“Blazing Sun”) rockets against targets in the Donbas, where Ukrainian forces are under constant, intense bombardment.
    
    TOS-1 is also thermobaric, with a range of up to 10km (six miles). The TOS-2’s manufacturer Rostec says TOS-2 has a longer range, better automatic targeting and more versatility. TOS-2 rockets are carried on an armoured truck, not a tank chassis.

    It was a rare trip for President Zelensky outside Kyiv. He visited troops on the frontline near Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second city, handed out awards and gifts, and thanked soldiers for their service.
    
    “You’re risking your life for all of us and our state,” he said. “Thank you for defending Ukraine’s independence. Take care!”
    
    The visit was a demonstration of the country’s success in pushing Russian forces back from the city. And was probably intended to boost morale as Ukraine tries to contain a massive Russian offensive in the Donbas area further east.
    
    An onslaught that is causing enormous suffering and destruction.
    
    Hours after the president left, loud explosions were reported in Kharkiv. A message that the threat posed by the invading forces there may have subsided, but it’s not entirely gone.

    Verdi's Rigoletto is being performed at Kyiv's Opera House
    
    Ukraine’s capital is 1,540 years old this weekend, and you’d be forgiven for assuming Kyiv wasn’t in the mood to celebrate.
    
    After all, it’s just over three months ago that the city found itself surrounded by Russian forces, with some predicting it would fall within 72 hours.
    
    At the time, I remember standing outside the Opera House, where the only gathering of people was outside a nearby pharmacy - scared and angry.
    
    Today it's a different scene. There is a sea of smiling faces, colourful outfits and cheerful chatter as people walk in to watch a performance of Verdi's Rigoletto. Shows returned last week; and you can’t help but feel the joy of those lucky enough to get a ticket. Tickets are limited to 300, the capacity of the theatre's bomb shelter.
    
    !Kyiv <image:1637>
    
    “Life really goes on and we do not stop,” says Pavlo, one of the soldiers in uniform, in passing. “We hope for the best and believe everything is going to be alright”.
    
    Backstage one of the lead singers, Olga Fomichova, sits illuminated by her make up mirror. “I can see our audience needs us, from the sold-out tickets, but it won’t be the same” she admits.
    
    “I don’t have anger or defiance, only the desire to be heard, that the Ukrainians are a cultural and educated nation which deserves world-wide respect and attention.”
    
    For several of its 1,540 years, other rulers and empires have tried to take Kyiv by force. Some have been more successful than others, but few predicted such attempts would be made in 2022.

    !Volodymyr Zelensky visits Kharkiv <image:1640>Image source, Ukraine President's Office
    
    Volodymyr Zelensky has not turned out to be the president many predicted. The former comedian, the voice of Ukrainian Paddington Bear, was once mocked as a lightweight.
    
    Now, he is compared to Winston Churchill.
    
    His steadfastness in the face of overwhelming Russian force is credited by many as being a crucial factor in his country’s remarkable performance in the beginning of this war.
    
    His defiant videos from the streets of the capital, Kyiv, were a metaphorical middle finger to Russia and its president.
    
    While President Zelensky would appear with his colleagues, arms around their shoulders, Vladimir Putin was pictured at one end of an almost comedically long table, his officials barely in shouting distance.
    
    As effective as they were, however, those appearances were all in the capital. Today’s visit to Kharkiv is the first time he has left the Kyiv region since the start of Russia’s invasion.
    
    He met the troops that have not just defended Kharkiv, but repelled the Russians, almost pushing them back to the international border.
    
    The fact that he was able to visit shows just how much the tide has turned in Ukraine’s second city. A few weeks ago, this morale boosting visit would never have been possible.
    
    But, do not be mistaken, Kharkiv is only safe for now. Elsewhere, Ukraine very much appears on the back foot, withering Russian artillery barrages forcing them to retreat in the Donbas.
    
    With its charismatic president, Ukraine has very much won the informational war. Unfortunately for them, that is not where this conflict will ultimately be decided.

    Stopping Russia is the common mission of all civilised countries, Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhaylo Podolyak has said.
    
    "'Why does the world pay more attention to Ukraine than to Africa or the East?' - such a narrative is promoted by Russian agents," he wrote in a tweet.
    
    The Ukraine war is not a local conflict - it is the question of what the world will be like tomorrow, he added.
    
    Allowing Russia to win would "open Pandora's box and push humanity into the dark ages."
    
    Podolyak went on to say: "Any autocrat would be able to provoke territorial conflicts, seize countries and exterminate nations.
    
    "Stopping Russia is a mission of all civilized countries. There's time, but we should hurry up."

7.  !Kherson pictured on 20 May <image:1643>Image source, Getty Images
    
    Moscow-imposed authorities in the southern city of Kherson say nearby fighting could affect the timing of its formal bid to join Russia.
    
    Russian forces occupied Kherson in early March - one week after the invasion of Ukraine began. It was the first major city to fall.
    
    Kirill Stremousov, deputy-head of [Kherson's Moscow-installed administration](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-61338617)
    , says the process might involve a referendum, backtracking on previous comments suggesting none was needed.
    
    According to Reuters news agency, he says: "We'll announce later when some kind of vote or plebiscite is planned, but it won’t be today and it won’t be tomorrow because our first task is to restore order in the Kherson region."
    
    Russia has said that the fate of the Kherson region is for local residents to decide.
    
    But the UK Ministry of Defence said, [in an intelligence update in April, external](https://twitter.com/DefenceHQ/status/1518335593482268672)
    , a referendum would be a way for Russia to justify its occupation of Ukraine.
    
    And President Zelensky has said it fits in with Russia's plans of breaking Ukraine apart by creating "pseudo-republics" throughout the country.
    
    He has advised people [not to give the Russian authorities any personal data](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-61188943)
    , such as passport numbers, as they might be used to falsify votes.

    He visited the frontline in the Kharkiv region where he spoke with troops and presented gifts.
    
    It comes as intense fighting continues in the region as troops attempt to regain control of the area from the Russians.

10.  Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said last week's talks with Finnish and Swedish delegations were not at the "expected level" and Ankara cannot approve their applications to join the Nato military alliance.
    
    "For as long as Tayyip Erdogan is the head of the Republic of Turkey, we definitely cannot say 'yes' to countries which support terrorism entering Nato," the president said.
    
    Without the support of all Nato members, Sweden and Finland cannot join the military alliance.
    
    Both Nordic countries deny supporting Kurdish militants. But they have joined other EU countries in imposing a weapons embargo on Turkey following its operations against Kurdish groups in Syria.

12.  As we reported earlier, Russia's defence ministry says its missiles have destroyed a large arsenal of Ukrainian army weapons in Kryvyi Rih - the home city of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
    
    Now we can bring you more details. Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov claims in the last 24 hours more than 300 "nationalists" \[Ukrainian soldiers\] have been killed.
    
    He also claims a number of other Ukrainian military targets were hit in the offensive, including a Russian defence systems shooting down a Ukrainian SU-25 fighter jet in Dnipro.
    
    He says: "In total, as a result of Russian air strikes, more than 300 nationalists and up to 50 units of military and special equipment of the armed forces of Ukraine were destroyed."

13.  The governor of the Luhansk region has accused Russia of systematically destroying the city of Severodonetsk and its residents.
    
    Serhiy Haidai said the attacks were relentless as fierce fighting rages in the area.
    
    Severodonetsk is the easternmost place in the Donbas region still held by Ukraine and it is currently a key target for Russian forces.
    
    The Luhansk governor said more civilians in the city had been killed in the latest attacks and buildings had been destroyed, including apartment blocks and a cinema.
    
    But he said Russian troops trying to capture a vital road out had been driven back.
    
    Earlier Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said the situation remained difficult in the Donbas and Kharkiv regions where he said Russia was trying to "squeeze out some result for itself".

    [What we heard from Russia's UK ambassador Andrei Kelin](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-61618902)
    , we’ve been hearing for years from Russian officials whenever their county is accused of anything.
    
    All accusations are rebuffed, all evidence of Russian complicity is dismissed.
    
    What you end up with is this parallel reality in which CCTV footage of Russian soldiers shooting dead unarmed Ukrainian civilians is dismissed as a joke or a computer game.
    
    Where the [horrors of Bucha](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/60981238)
     are dismissed as a fabrication, and where the levelling of residential areas of Mariupol is brushed aside as either collateral damage or blamed on Ukrainian soldiers.
    
    In other words, none of this is ever Russia’s fault, everyone is against Russia, everyone is blaming Russia, everyone is accusing Russia and it claims it is the innocent party.
    
    This is the Kremlin narrative which we’ve heard many times before. We heard it after the Salisbury poisonings, we heard it after the attempted assassination of the Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny and we’re hearing it again now.

16.  !The BBC's Clive Myrie with Russian ambassador to the UK Andrei Kelin <image:1653>
    
    As we've previously reported, Russia's ambassador to the UK has told the BBC he does not believe his country will use tactical nuclear weapons in the war against Ukraine.
    
    He has also criticised the UK's Foreign Secretary Liz Truss for her tough stance on Russia. Britain has [imposed a number of sanctions on Russian individuals and businesses](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60125659)
    , as well as sending weapons to Ukraine.
    
    Ambassador Andrei Kelin told the BBC's Clive Myrie: "She's neither a professional military man or she's not for a long time at this position.
    
    "But she's very belligerent...
    
    "On the position that UK would like to supply more and more arms, \[but\] not to think about the future of Ukraine or of Europe...
    
    "But just to instigate conflict. Why this? What's the motivation for that?
    
    "To make Russia more feeble?"
    
    The ambassador added that Russia's economy has not "toppled down" despite the restrictions and asked what the benefit of sanctions was for the UK, which has [seen inflation hit a 40-year high](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-61483175)
    , partly driven by the Ukraine war.
    
    After sanctions were imposed on Russia, the rouble fell 22% in value pushing up the price of imported goods, before it recovered.
    
    More than 1,000 international companies have also suspended trading in Russia or withdrawn altogether - including McDonalds, Coca-Cola and Starbucks.

    The question about negotiating in a war depends on the battlefield and on the state of mind of the parties contesting it.
    
    It has to get to a point where either side is suffering so much they are prepared to go into negotiations and give some ground, or that one side feels it has achieved enough and it is prepared to bank those gains.
    
    But at the moment I think both the Russians and Ukrainians have unfinished agendas.
    
    The Ukrainians want the Russians out. The Russians want to move forward and make their points, and deliver a victory.
    
    So I think politically there is no chance right now for a negotiation that means anything other than people getting together and talking in a room.

18.  Russia has rejected accusations that its invasion of Ukraine has created serious threats to global food security, instead blaming Western sanctions.
    
    The West has accused the Russian military of holding food supplies hostage for millions around the world.
    
    The war in Ukraine has blocked the country's main ports on the Black sea, severely impacting food supply chains around the world. Ukraine is a major exporter of wheat, but now millions of tonnes of grain are stuck - impacting the countries that can least afford it.
    
    "The attempts of the West to attribute all troubles to the special military operation and accuse Russia of blocking foreign ships in the ports of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov are absolutely groundless," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said.
    
    "The main catalyst for the existing negative trends was the anti-Russian sanctions of the West, which led to a rupture of ties in the field of global logistics and transport infrastructure," she said.
    
    The hike in prices for agricultural products started in 2020 "and is by no means a result of the special military operation" in Ukraine she claimed, before also blaming Covid.
    
    The pandemic "has severely disrupted value chains and significantly increased the cost of food transportation services", she added.

    The war is especially raging in the east of Ukraine in the Donbas region.
    
    Russian forces have launched a number of assaults around the city of Severodonetsk, which is increasingly finding itself surrounded.
    
    Military experts think there is not much for Russia to gain economically or militarily by taking the city other than to declare some kind of early victory in the war, as it remains the last major city not in Russian control in the region of Luhansk.
    
    What isn't clear is whether Russian President Vladimir Putin, should the Donbas region fall, will continue to try and take more of Ukraine.
    
    It's been another night where we've seen more missile attacks, which continually raise questions over what happens next.

20.  Russia’s ambassador to the UK has told the BBC he does not believe his country will use tactical nuclear weapons in the war against Ukraine.
    
    Speaking to Clive Myrie, Andrei Kelin said such weapons would be used only if Russia’s existence was threatened.
    
    The ambassador also denied Russian forces were shelling civilians, and said allegations of war crimes in the town of Bucha were a "fabrication".
    
    Kelin's claims are contradicted by numerous [eyewitness accounts from residents](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-61003878)
    , who have told the BBC that Russian troops executed their loved ones.

Zelensky, on a rare trip outside Kiev, visited the front line where he met Ukrainian troops

!Zelensky, on a rare trip outside Kiev, visited the front line where he met Ukrainian troops <image:1659>

Ukraine's president has made a rare trip outside the capital, Kiev, the presidential office says.

According to foreign media, Telegrafi reports, Zelensky visited the frontline positions in the Kharkiv region.

! <image:1660>

  

"I want to thank each of you for your service. You risk your life for all of us and our country", the president told the troops.

! <image:1661>

The northeastern city has seen some of the fiercest fighting since Russia launched its aggression in Ukraine on February 24.

! <image:1662>

His visit comes as Ukraine has begun receiving Harpoon anti-ship missiles from Denmark and others from the US.

Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov was quoted as saying that the supply of Harpoon missiles was the result of cooperation between several countries.

! <image:1663>

Ukraine has sought more sophisticated weapons, but so far most of the help has been in short-range systems, such as anti-tank weapons.

Meanwhile, the US is said to be considering a request from Ukraine to supply Kiev with heavier, longer-range weapons, but has yet to make a final decision. /**Telegraph**/

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The BBC published an article on March 17, 2025, discussing the retreat of Ukrainian troops from the Kursk region, including Sudzha. The article includes a picture of a damaged statue of Lenin in Sudzha and a map showing Sudzha under Ukrainian control in August 2024 and under Russian control on March 16, 2025. The article also mentions that President Volodymyr Zelensky said he believed the Kursk operation had "accomplished its task" ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0q198zyppqo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0q198zyppqo)).

Meduza published an article on March 17, 2025, discussing Russia's counteroffensive in the Kursk region, mentioning Sudzha and the Kursk Offensive ([https://meduza.io/en/feature/2025/03/17/a-costly-gamble](https://meduza.io/en/feature/2025/03/17/a-costly-gamble)). CNN reports that Volodymyr Zelensky said on August 15, 2024, that Ukrainian forces have taken control of the Russian town of Sudzha ([https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/15/europe/kursk-incursion-sudzha-captured-ukraine-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/15/europe/kursk-incursion-sudzha-captured-ukraine-intl)). <image:5594>, <image:5588>, <image:k>.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that the claim is plausible. CNN reported that Ukrainian forces took control of Sudzha in August 2024. The BBC article and Meduza mention the Kursk Offensive and Sudzha. The image's metadata is missing, so it's impossible to verify the exact date and location. However, the evidence supports the possibility of Zelensky visiting Sudzha in August 2024.

The claim states that Zelensky arrived in August 2024 in Sudzha, which had just been occupied by Ukrainian troops. The BBC article and CNN report support the claim that Sudzha was under Ukrainian control in August 2024.

The claim also states that Zelensky met with representatives of the people there. The evidence does not provide information about whether Zelensky met with representatives. Therefore, this part of the claim cannot be verified.

For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion.

On December 2, anonymous Russian-language accounts on Facebook and Instagram ([1](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=541571908871528&set=a.101819279513462)
, [2](https://www.instagram.com/vizovvremenivv/p/DDE_2QJt2iJ/)
) spread information claiming that Volodymyr Zelensky purchased a hotel in Courchevel, France, for 88 million. Reports about the hotel sale have been spread by a questionable French-language media outlet, registered on November 25 of this year, while the link, which according to the report leads to the hotel’s website, is fraudulent and was created on November 22.**

Several fact-checking organizations ( [Dpa](https://dpa-factchecking.com/belgium/241203-99-214531/?fbclid=IwY2xjawG88MtleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHbkKjc7q2HviTLlnsH5KzjC2JQPi3w2sNcgRkQEHVvvYgS8-qSYNs4frmw_aem_cnqG1ln1AEcVYLnwDOBbxQ)

) have published articles on this topic. Therefore, the newly registered site under the same name is fraudulent.

[![morigi dezinphormatsia thithqos volodimir zelenskim dzviradghirebuli sastumro sheidzina3 | mythdetector.com](https://mythdetector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/morigi-dezinphormatsia-thithqos-volodimir-zelenskim-dzviradghirebuli-sastumro-sheidzina3.png "morigi dezinphormatsia thithqos volodimir zelenskim dzviradghirebuli sastumro sheidzina3 | mythdetector.com")](https://mythdetector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/morigi-dezinphormatsia-thithqos-volodimir-zelenskim-dzviradghirebuli-sastumro-sheidzina3.png)

The archived version of the fake website states that the hotel is owned by Film Heritage Inc., an offshore company that was reportedly managed by Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his wife, Olena Zelenska, until 2019. This fact has been reported by [various media outlets](https://lobservateurdemonaco.com/enquetes/hotel-de-luxe-courchevel-sbm/)
, but nowhere does it state that the hotel was resold and purchased by the Zelenskyy family.

It is worth noting that the claim that the Zelenskyy family spends Western money on personal luxuries has long been circulating and used as a Russian method to discredit Zelenskyy. *   [About Us](https://mythdetector.com/en/about-us/)

**The information claiming that Volodymyr Zelenskyy purchased an expensive villa in France is false. [Ukraine’s Center for Countering Disinformation](https://t.me/CenterCounteringDisinformation/12442)
 has also addressed the issue.

The claim about Zelensky purchasing a villa in France appeared on a French-language website, [Les Echos de la France](https://lesechosdelafrance.fr/la-societe-de-zelensky-a-achete-un-hotel-dans-la-station-de-ski-de-courchevel/)
, which presents itself as a media outlet, on November 28. However, using relevant keywords to search online, we found no such information in any reputable media sources.

The [Les Echos de la France](https://lesechosdelafrance.fr/la-societe-de-zelensky-a-achete-un-hotel-dans-la-station-de-ski-de-courchevel/)
 article includes a hyperlink to the hotel’s website, which is currently [inaccessible](https://hotelpalacedesneiges.com/)
. However, the official website of [Palace des Neiges](https://www.montecarlosbm.com/en/hotel-courchevel/monte-carlo-one-courchevel)

Multiple tweets, posted between November 12-15, 2022, claim that Ukraine sent billions of dollars sourced from foreign aid to FTX, which was then sent back to the Democratic party.

The claim has been spread by a number of prominent right-leaning commentators and politicians, including [Madison Cawthorn](https://twitter.com/CawthornforNC)
, [James Woods](https://twitter.com/RealJamesWoods/status/1592041414829166592)

 and [Jack Posobiec](https://twitter.com/JackPosobiec/status/1591855516053303298)
, among others.

Various iterations of the narrative took root on conspiracy theory subreddits, 4Chan, and other fringe online spaces.

Everstake, a crypto firm involved in setting up the donations, [has responded on Twitter](https://twitter.com/everstake_pool/status/1592621937054085120)
 to claims that these funds were illegally transferred to the Democrats, stating Aid for Ukraine had used FTX "only a few times in March 2022 exclusively to convert crypto donations into fiat" which it said The National Bank of Ukraine [had confirmed receipt of.](https://twitter.com/NBUkraine/status/1502207218514604034)

It added that of the $60 million received through Aid For Ukraine, $54 million had been spent on "Ukraine's humanitarian and military needs." Ukraine's Vice Prime Minister Fedorov Mykhailo made the same claim on Twitter, and included what he said was a [breakdown of this spending.](https://twitter.com/FedorovMykhailo/status/1559923193581899777)

Everstake added that the funds received were not stored on FTX and could be "converted into fiat elsewhere if necessary."

Its CEO Sergey Vasylchuk [took to Twitter](https://twitter.com/everstake_pool/status/1592622417226366977)
 as well, alleging that the claim was part of a Russian disinformation effort.

"Every time Russia is defeated on the battlefield, it starts looking for another way to cover up its military failures in the media by spreading fake news based on made-up assumptions," Vasylchuk said.

"This time, they decided to use the FTX collapse to spin yet another tale about money laundering. aid misappropriated?
-----------------------------

The claim that funds were effectively "laundered" from Ukraine via FTX back into the U.S., less so to the Democratic party coffers or Biden himself, is unevidenced.

_Newsweek_ has investigated the coverage of this claim across social media and larger media outlets and could find no transaction ID, statements, or any other tangible evidence to support the idea that U.S. government funding—under the nose of a multi-million dollar oversight process coordinated between the Office of Inspector General, the DOD and USAID—it would require a major lapse in oversight from those auditing Ukraine and a breakdown of protections in place to ensure funds could not be re-appropriated.

Furthermore, funding for Ukraine [received bipartisan support](https://www.newsweek.com/these-69-house-reps-voted-against-providing-ukraine-aid-1686658)
, meaning that both Democrats and Republicans signed off on the terms of the funding and how it would be managed.

In response to these claims Alex Bornyakov, Deputy Minister of Digital Transformation of Ukraine on IT industry development [tweeted:](https://twitter.com/abornyakov/status/1592241279051743233)

Did FTX send Ukrainian crypto donations to the U.S.?
----------------------------------------------------

FTX has also played a role in providing Ukraine with the capability to receive cryptocurrency donations since Russia's invasion.

In [March 2022](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/03/14/ukraine-partners-with-ftx-everstake-to-launch-new-crypto-donation-website/)
, the Ukrainian government launched a crypto donations website, Aid for Ukraine, with the backing of FTX, to route donated crypto to the National Bank of Ukraine. According [to its website](https://aid-for-ukraine.io/)
, Aid for Ukraine has received more than $60 million in donations including [611 Bitcoin](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/357a3So9CbsNfBBgFYACGvxxS6tMaDoa1P)

For example, under the Additional Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Act 2022, the bill behind the $40 billion in emergency funding to Ukraine, $5 million was spent on oversight of the funds alone, including by the Department of State Inspector General and the USAID Inspector General.

The Office of Inspector General Oversight in the Department of Defence (DOD OIG) and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID OIG) both provide audits of the use of funding in Ukraine and investigate complaints and allegations of misuse or attempted misuse of [USAID funding](https://oig.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/2022-11/Office%20of%20Investigations%20Ukraine%20Briefing%20Sheet%20-%20Oct%2022.pdf)

However, Ukraine’s government “never invested any funds into FTX,” Alex Bornyakov, the deputy minister of digital transformation in Ukraine said [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/abornyakov/status/1592241279051743233?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1592241279051743233%7Ctwgr%5Eff3dcafd17a806bb6a0a472b14ff2c933ac7e1a9%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fleadstories.com%2Fhoax-alert%2F2022%2F11%2Ffact-check-no-evidence-us-aid-to-ukraine-was-laundered-through-crypto-exchange-channeled-to-democrats.html)

CLAIM: U.S. The company filed for bankruptcy protection amid news it was short billions of dollars and may have been hacked.

The move has fueled baseless conspiracy theories on social media around the embattled former CEO’s donations, FTX, and Democrats who ran in this year’s midterm elections.

“So Biden gave loads of money to Ukraine, who gave loads of money to FTX, who gave loads of money to Democrats,” reads one tweet with over 100,000 likes.

“For an entire year Democrat law makers have stood on the House floor and demanded taxpayer $$ for Ukraine. The ministry said it “provided informational support” to the foundation, which was run by the cryptocurrency exchange Kuna and the blockchain company Everstake.

In early March, Aid For Ukraine began working with FTX to convert cryptocurrency donations into Ukraine’s government-issued currency, a partnership that ended in April 2022, according to the ministry.

Sergey Vasylchuk, the CEO of Everstake, told the AP that cryptocurrencies were an efficient way to raise funds for Ukraine to defend itself amid Russia’s invasion. The donations would then get sent to the [National Bank of Ukraine](https://twitter.com/NBUkraine/status/1502207218514604034)
 and no crypto was stored on FTX.

“It was eight months ago and the goal was that Aid for Ukraine was to supply the needs as soon as possible,” Vasylchuk said when asked about the relationship between Aid for Ukraine and FTX. FTX’s co-CEO [Ryan Salame](https://www.fec.gov/data/receipts/individual-contributions/?contributor_name=Ryan+Salame&two_year_transaction_period=2022&min_date=01%2F01%2F2021&max_date=12%2F31%2F2022)

Posts shared on Facebook allege that former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick has threatened to leave the United States “because of Trump supporters.” Though intended as satire, several users seem to have taken this seriously.

Examples of posts making this claim can be found [here](https://www.facebook.com/ALLODSatire2/posts/3020933381475578)
; , [here](https://www.facebook.com/art.jones.5/posts/3303647453036654)
 and [here](https://www.facebook.com/janyerdominguez/posts/10222928231691306)
 .

Kaepernick last played in the NFL in 2016, the year when he sparked national controversy for taking a knee during the national anthem as a protest against racial inequality and police brutality in the United States. You are good for nothing!”

The post on  “America – Love It Or Leave It” includes a link to a Daily World Update article ( [here](https://dailyworldupdate.us/colin-kaepernick-threatens-to-leave-america-because-of-trump-supporters/?fbclid=IwAR08AjXhxrjWZP2aHoDuhaORlUQrQkRXYuukngmkTvcAK3-GS2FmUXRLYbE)
 ) with the headline “Colin Kaepernick Threatens To Leave America Because of Trump Supporters.” As stated in the website’s “About” section ( [dailyworldupdate.us/about/](https://dailyworldupdate.us/about/)
 ), “DailyWorldUpdate.us is a subsidiary of the ‘America’s Last Line of Defense’ network of parody, satire, and tomfoolery.” It notes that “everything on this website is fiction. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined.”

Text in the article itself ( [here](https://dailyworldupdate.us/colin-kaepernick-threatens-to-leave-america-because-of-trump-supporters/?fbclid=IwAR08AjXhxrjWZP2aHoDuhaORlUQrQkRXYuukngmkTvcAK3-GS2FmUXRLYbE)
 )  also suggests that the story is satirical. The claim that Colin Kaepernick has threatened to leave the United States because of Trump supporters originated in a clearly satirical article on the website DailyWorldUpdate.us.

This article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team. Some fans praised Kaepernick and other players joined him in the protest, but his action was criticized by President Donald as unpatriotic.

The posts making the claim were posted on Oct. For example, it quotes a Kaepernick spokesman as saying that the former NFL player “loves America and would never think about leaving,” then adds, “not to mention no other country will have Americans because Trump screwed up so much that the world thinks we’re walking infection machines.”

VERDICT

Satire."

Russia's 2016 disinformation campaign sought to leverage the NFL national anthem kneeling controversy as part of a broader effort to divide the US and inflame racial divisions, according to [the second volume of the Senate Intelligence Committee's report](https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Report_Volume2.pdf)
 on Russian election interference, which was released on Tuesday.

The report said that the focus on the NFL kneeling controversy went well beyond 2016 and continued as late as March 2018. 

It's been previously reported that Russian trolls [continued efforts to divide the US after Election Day 2016](https://www.businessinsider.com/new-knowledge-oxford-reports-russia-disinformation-campaign-senate-intelligence-committee-2018-12)
, and that [the NFL has been a big target](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-russian-trolls-inflamed-nfls-anthem-controversy-1540233979)
, but the second volume of the Senate Intelligence Committee report builds on the extent to which race and the national anthem kneeling debate were part of the disinformation campaign. 

"The Committee found that no single group of Americans was targeted by IRA information operatives more than African-Americans," the report said. "By far, race and related issues were the preferred target of the information warfare campaign designed to divide the country in 2016."

_

The Internet Research Agency, the notorious Russian troll farm at the center of these efforts, "heavily focused on hotbutton issues with racial undertones, such as the NFL kneeling protests."

This included references to Colin Kaepernick, the quarterback who garnered national attention for kneeling during the national anthem and was ostracized by the league as a result. 

"A Left Troll account, @wokeluisa, tweeted in support of Colin Kaepernick and tje NFL protests on March 13, 2018, prompting 37,000 forwarded retweets," the report said. "Simultaneous to this, and in .the direction of the ideologically opposite audience, @BarbaraForTrump, a Right Troll account, was tweeting content hostile to the protests."

The Senate Intelligence Committee "found that IRA activity on social media did not cease, but rather increased after Election Day 2016."

Russia's efforts to interfere in the 2016 election has been among the most divisive topics in Washington since the last presidential election. An assessment from US intelligence agencies found that Russia [interfered in the election under the orders of Russian President Vladimir Putin](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-russia-cyber-idUSKBN14Q1T8)
 with the intention of boosting [Donald Trump's](https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-donald-trump-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-4)
 chances of winning by maligning former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. 

Despite the intelligence community's findings and [continued warnings about the Kremlin's ongoing efforts](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-intelligence-officials-warn-of-pervasive-russian-efforts-to-disrupt-2018-elections-1533235652)
 to intervene in the US electoral process, Trump has expressed skepticism that Russia interfered in the 2016 election and downplayed the issue at times. 

Former special counsel Robert Mueller, who conducted an extensive investigation on Russia's efforts and issued a 448-page report on this, concluded that Russia [sought to help Trump](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/07/24/two-big-mueller-exchanges-that-capture-russia-scandal/)

Since 2016, the eyes of the world have been on Colin Kaepernick. Pro-Trump accounts on Twitter helped to drive the campaign to boycott Nike once it named Kaepernick as the face of its Just Do It advertising campaign, new analysis shows.

Twitter activity around the protests also shows accounts believed to be linked to Russia's ongoing disinformation campaign helped to amplify the anti-Nike sentiment. This was followed by #nike, #colinkaepernick, #boycottnike, #kaepernick and #dumpnikestock, which all had more than 1,000 uses. A limited number of tweets led to [widespread](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/colin-kaepernick-nike-campaign-social-media-reaction)
 press coverage of protests.

The attempted boycott has worked out well for Nike. Mark Parker, the company's chief executive, said that customers responded "quite strongly" to the Kaepernick advertisement.

"Like many campaigns, it's driving a real uptick in traffic and engagement, both socially as well as commercially," Parker was reported as saying by the [_BBC_](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-45643845)
.

Graphika says Russian Twitter accounts targeted the Nike boycott but did not create it. [_CNN_ has previously reported](https://money.cnn.com/2018/09/08/technology/nfl-national-anthem-russia-trolls/index.html)
 on Russian links to online criticism of Kaepernick.

"Our understanding of how the Russians work – not just in the American political environment but in Europe and elsewhere – is they embed these sock puppet assets into the natural political landscape of the country they are trying to influence," Kelly says. Graphika says the online movement spread, this group grew from 18 per cent of hashtag uses to 21 per cent and largely was reacting to the pro-Trump group.

Data from analysts at [Brandwatch](https://www.brandwatch.com/blog/react-nike-colin-kaepernick-just-do-it-ad/)
 found that from September 2 to September 4 mentions of "Just Do It" increased by more than 3,460 per cent and Nike's overall online sentiment dropped after it released the ad. As the national anthem played, Kaepernick [remained sitting on the bench](https://www.prweek.com/article/1407098/nfl-49ers-tread-sensitive-line-kaepernick-controversy)
 in protest at the oppression of black people in the US.

The protest was the first of many, with Kaepernick and other players subsequently taking the knee. The first scan, conducted within hours after Nike named Kaepernick as the face of its new advert on September 3, found around 7,000 to 8,000 accounts using the initial hashtags calling for a boycott of Nike.

Kelly says that around 12-18 hours later when the second scan was conducted there were more than 80,000 different Twitter accounts that had posted messages with the hashtags."

 claiming to be the cover of a weekly issue of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. According to the alleged cover, the Ukrainian president says from the coffin, “Ukraine is an independent state.” The image also includes a date – March 20, 2025 – as the release date of the magazine issue.

**A fake Charlie Hebdo cover is being spread on Facebook. Notably, in March 2025, the magazine [released](https://charliehebdo.fr/editions/)
 four issues – March 5, 12, 19, and 26 – with covers that were entirely different from the image circulating on Facebook. The photo circulated on Facebook features a serial number of the issue – 1705, which [matches](https://charliehebdo.fr/editions/1705/)
 the actual issue published on March 26.

Content: "This is stated in the information on the publication’s website.

Thus, the fake cover allegedly contains the magazine’s release date – March 20, 2025 and the serial number of the magazine – 1705.

[![](//i0.wp.com/without-lie.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/home/dr343163/without-lie.info/www/anh2-1.jpg?resize=708%2C593&ssl=1)](//i0.wp.com/without-lie.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/home/dr343163/without-lie.info/www/anh2-1.jpg?ssl=1)

However, Charlie Hebdo did not publish a magazine on March 20 with such a number. It was falsified based on the real cover of the publication, which was published on March 19, 2025.

In terms of content, this fake is aimed at humiliating and discrediting the Ukrainian president, who allegedly has no political future, and his dreams of an independent Ukraine are unattainable.

**Russian propaganda continues to exploit the topic of fake covers of Western publications, which mock Ukraine or the Ukrainian leadership in the form of caricatures. This time, the cover of Charlie Hebdo magazine has been falsified.

[![](//i0.wp.com/without-lie.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/home/dr343163/without-lie.info/www/shar2-3.jpg?resize=708%2C592&ssl=1)](//i0.wp.com/without-lie.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/home/dr343163/without-lie.info/www/shar2-3.jpg?ssl=1)

The cover, which was distributed by Russian propaganda Telegram channels, depicts a caricature of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is allegedly lying in a coffin. 1704 for March 19, 2025 ([https://surl.li/qgqsaf](//surl.li/qgqsaf)
). So, the previous 1703rd issue was published on March 12, 2025 ([https://surl.li/srmwfu](//surl.li/srmwfu)
), and the 1702nd – on March 5, 2025 ([https://surli.cc/tefpcg](//surli.cc/tefpcg)
).

[![](//i0.wp.com/without-lie.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/home/dr343163/without-lie.info/www/shar3-2.jpg?resize=708%2C417&ssl=1)](//i0.wp.com/without-lie.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/home/dr343163/without-lie.info/www/shar3-2.jpg?ssl=1)

In addition, the upcoming issue of the magazine cannot contain a caricature of the president of Ukraine either – both the original cover and the fake one have an image of the announcement of the next issue of the magazine and its cover in the upper corner. For example, the other day, the cover of the French humorous publication Charlie Hebdo actively went viral in the Russian segment of Telegram – such a post was spread by one of the top Russian propaganda channels “Ukropsky Fresh” ([https://surl.li/kcqnza](//surl.li/kcqnza)
), the anti-Ukrainian resource “Drugaya Ukraina” ([https://surli.cc/blivly](//surli.cc/blivly)
), as well as the Kremlin’s top propagandist Solovyov ([https://surl.li/ksrqfa](//surl.li/ksrqfa)
). The cover contains a humiliating inscription, namely: “A political corpse is taking its last breath,” and the phrase “Ukraine is an independent state” is supposedly flying from the image of Zelensky himself.

However, Charlie Hebdo did not publish such an issue of the magazine with such a cover. And it has a completely different picture.

Accordingly, it can be stated that the publication in Russian Telegram channels of the cover of Charlie Hebdo magazine with a caricature of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is a fake."

[Hunter Biden](/wiki/Hunter_Biden "Hunter Biden")

Some of the primary subjects of the conspiracy theory

The **Biden–Ukraine conspiracy theory** is a series of false allegations that [Joe Biden](/wiki/Joe_Biden "Joe Biden")
, while he was [vice president of the United States](/wiki/Vice_president_of_the_United_States "Vice president of the United States")
, improperly withheld a loan guarantee and took a bribe to pressure [Ukraine](/wiki/Ukraine "Ukraine")
 into firing [prosecutor general](/wiki/Prosecutor_General_of_Ukraine "Prosecutor General of Ukraine")
 [Viktor Shokin](/wiki/Viktor_Shokin "Viktor Shokin")
 to prevent a corruption investigation of Ukrainian gas company [Burisma](/wiki/Burisma "Burisma")
 and to protect his son [Hunter Biden](/wiki/Hunter_Biden "Hunter Biden")
, who was on the Burisma [board](/wiki/Board_of_directors "Board of directors")
.[\[1\]](#cite_note-false-allegations-group-1)
 As part of efforts by [Donald Trump](/wiki/Donald_Trump "Donald Trump")
[\[2\]](#cite_note-2)
 and his campaign in the [Trump–Ukraine scandal](/wiki/Trump%E2%80%93Ukraine_scandal "Trump–Ukraine scandal")
, which led to [Trump's first impeachment](/wiki/First_impeachment_of_Donald_Trump "First impeachment of Donald Trump")
, these falsehoods were spread in an attempt to damage Joe Biden's reputation and chances during the [2020 presidential campaign](/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign")
, and later in an effort to impeach him.[\[3\]](#cite_note-3)

Joe Biden followed State Department intentions when he withheld the loan guarantee to pressure Ukraine into removing the prosecutor,[\[4\]](#cite_note-Prokop_9/28/2023-4)
[\[5\]](#cite_note-Kessler-2020-5)
 who was seen as corrupt and failing to clean up Ukrainian corruption,[\[6\]](#cite_note-Blake-2020-6)
 in accordance with the official and bipartisan policy of the [United States](/wiki/United_States "United States")
, the [European Union](/wiki/European_Union "European Union")
, the [World Bank](/wiki/World_Bank "World Bank")
 and the [International Monetary Fund](/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund "International Monetary Fund")
.[\[7\]](#cite_note-7)
[\[8\]](#cite_note-March15Hearing-8)
[\[9\]](#cite_note-9)
 A confidential informant told the FBI that Burisma's owner said he was coerced to pay bribes to both Bidens to ensure Shokin was fired, though the informant was indicted in 2024 on charges he had fabricated the account.

[United States intelligence community](/wiki/United_States_intelligence_community "United States intelligence community")
 analysis released in March 2021 found that proxies of Russian intelligence promoted and [laundered](/wiki/Information_laundering "Information laundering")
 misleading or unsubstantiated narratives about the Bidens "to US media organizations, US officials, and prominent US individuals, including some close to former President Trump and his administration."[\[10\]](#cite_note-10)
[\[11\]](#cite_note-11)
[\[12\]](#cite_note-12)
 _[The New York Times](/wiki/The_New_York_Times "The New York Times")
_ reported in May 2021 that a federal criminal investigation was examining a possible role by current and former Ukrainian officials, including whether they used former Trump personal attorney [Rudy Giuliani](/wiki/Rudy_Giuliani "Rudy Giuliani")
, who was the subject of a separate but related federal investigation, to spread unsubstantiated claims.[\[13\]](#cite_note-13)

A joint investigation by two Republican Senate committees released in September 2020 found no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe Biden. The three committees released a report in August 2024 asserting Biden had "engaged in impeachable conduct," but they did not recommend proceeding to impeachment.[\[18\]](#cite_note-18)

Background
----------

See also: [Conspiracy theories related to the Trump–Ukraine scandal](/wiki/Conspiracy_theories_related_to_the_Trump%E2%80%93Ukraine_scandal "Conspiracy theories related to the Trump–Ukraine scandal")

Since the Independence of [Ukraine](/wiki/Ukraine "Ukraine")
 following the collapse of the [Soviet Union](/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union")
, Russia has had a history of running direct and active measures to undermine the sovereignty of Ukraine.[\[19\]](#cite_note-19)
 This included placing operatives in the government, influencing elections, and encouraging corruption.[\[20\]](#cite_note-20)
[\[21\]](#cite_note-21)
[\[22\]](#cite_note-22)

After the start of the [Russo-Ukrainian War](/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War "Russo-Ukrainian War")
, when Russia invaded Crimea and Eastern Ukraine, Russia began to take active measures to influence presidential elections in the [United States](/wiki/United_States "United States")
.[\[23\]](#cite_note-23)
[\[24\]](#cite_note-24)
 Beginning in 2014, this included efforts to discredit [Joe Biden](/wiki/Joe_Biden "Joe Biden")
.[\[25\]](#cite_note-Mayer-2019-25)

The series of false allegations about Joe Biden and Burisma[\[25\]](#cite_note-Mayer-2019-25)
 emerged at a convergence of interest between Russian efforts to help Trump's candidacy,[\[26\]](#cite_note-Bastos-2019-26)
 operatives and supporters of the Trump campaign,[\[27\]](#cite_note-27)
 and media in the United States.[\[28\]](#cite_note-28)
[\[29\]](#cite_note-29)

The thesis of the false conspiracy theory asserts that Joe Biden sought the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor to protect his son,[\[26\]](#cite_note-Bastos-2019-26)
 and that he did it in a _[quid pro quo](/wiki/Quid_pro_quo "Quid pro quo")
_ manner by trading loan guarantees for the personal favor. Trump and Giuliani associates Joe DiGenova and Victoria Toensing attempted to persuade Attorney General [William Barr](/wiki/William_Barr "William Barr")
 to drop charges against Firtash but failed.[\[62\]](#cite_note-NBC_News-2020-62)

#### Konstantin Kilimnik

[Konstantin Kilimnik](/wiki/Konstantin_Kilimnik "Konstantin Kilimnik")
 oversaw a network of people working on behalf of the Russian [Federal Security Service](/wiki/Federal_Security_Service "Federal Security Service")
 (FSB) to influence the 2020 elections.[\[63\]](#cite_note-63)
 Kilimnik had the single strongest ties, authorized by [President Putin](/wiki/President_Putin "President Putin")
,[\[64\]](#cite_note-64)
 to the Trump administration in both 2016 and 2020 elections.[\[65\]](#cite_note-65)
 He organized Russia's media outreach campaigns to spread lies about Biden and corruption in Ukraine as part of Russia's efforts to help Trump.[\[66\]](#cite_note-66)
[\[67\]](#cite_note-67)

### American media involvement

American media organizations with ties to the Trump campaign were involved in the spread of the false allegations.[\[25\]](#cite_note-Mayer-2019-25)
 Specifically [Peter Schweizer](/wiki/Peter_Schweizer "Peter Schweizer")
,[\[68\]](#cite_note-68)
 [John Solomon](/wiki/John_Solomon_(political_commentator) "John Solomon (political commentator)")
,[\[25\]](#cite_note-Mayer-2019-25)
 [Fox News](/wiki/Fox_News "Fox News")

 and [One America News Network](/wiki/One_America_News_Network "One America News Network")
[\[70\]](#cite_note-oan_atlantic-70)
 were essential in creating and disseminating the lies that built the background for this conspiracy theory.

#### Peter Schweizer

[Peter Schweizer](/wiki/Peter_Schweizer "Peter Schweizer")
, editor-at-large at _[Breitbart News](/wiki/Breitbart_News "Breitbart News")
_ and president of the conservative [Government Accountability Institute](/wiki/Government_Accountability_Institute "Government Accountability Institute")
, was the first person to spread the falsehoods about Joe Biden and Burisma in his book "Secret Empires".[\[25\]](#cite_note-Mayer-2019-25)
 The plagiarized book[\[71\]](#cite_note-71)
 included a false story that on January 12, 2017, Joe Biden, who was then the vice-president, sought to end an investigation into Burisma to protect Hunter Biden, who had a profitable post on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company run by a shady oligarch.[\[25\]](#cite_note-Mayer-2019-25)

Bill Barr led the corruption inquiry in 2020

Bill Barr, the attorney general under Mr Trump, opened a justice department inquiry into the allegations in 2020.

[He told the Federalist](https://thefederalist.com/2023/06/07/exclusive-bill-barr-confirms-rep-jamie-raskin-lied-about-biden-family-corruption-investigation/)
 last month that he passed the case on to the US attorney in Joe Biden's home state of Delaware.

No charges were ever filed in the case.

White House spokesman Ian Sams said: "It is remarkable that congressional Republicans, in their eagerness to go after President Biden regardless of the truth, continue to push claims that have been debunked for years.

"It's clear that congressional Republicans are dead-set on playing shameless, dishonest politics and refuse to let truth get in the way."

Congressional Republicans learned of the existence of the FBI document detailing the informant's account earlier this year.

They had pressed FBI Director Chris Wray to provide it to the House Oversight Committee - going so far as to threaten to hold him in contempt of Congress if he refused to comply.

He eventually provided members of the committee with the opportunity to privately access a redacted version, but warned that a public release would jeopardise FBI intelligence-gathering methods.

"We have repeatedly explained to Congress, in correspondence and in briefings, how critical it is to keep this source information confidential," the FBI said in a statement.

"Today's release of the 1023 - at a minimum - unnecessarily risks the safety of a confidential source."

After a private review of the document last month, Jamie Raskin, the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, said it contained only unfounded, second-hand accusations and no new details.

The FBI officials have described FD-1023 forms as a means to document "raw, unverified" intelligence information that does not reflect the conclusions of investigators.

"Recording this information does not validate it, establish its credibility, or weigh it against other information known or developed by the FBI in our investigations," the agency said in a recent statement.

Even Senator Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican who with Mr Grassley wrote a Senate report on Hunter Biden, has sounded sceptical about the memo.

[According to the Cedar Rapids Gazette](https://www.thegazette.com/government-politics/iowas-chuck-grassley-releases-fbi-memo-with-unverified-claims-alleging-biden-bribery-scheme/)
, he told a conservative radio show host Vicki McKenna last month: "This could be coming from a very corrupt oligarch who could be making this stuff up."

**A top Senate Republican has released an FBI document detailing an allegation President Joe Biden and his son accepted bribes from a Ukrainian firm.**

Chuck Grassley, who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said: "The American people can now read this document for themselves."

The unclassified memo is a June 2020 internal FBI report outlining claims by a foreign informant.

There is no evidence that Joe Biden received any payments from Ukraine.

Senior congressional Republicans have acknowledged the allegation is unverified.

The memo contains a claim that Hunter Biden was hired by the Ukrainian energy company, Burisma, in 2013 as a way to gain support from his father, who was the US vice-president at the time.

*   [What was Hunter Biden doing in China and Ukraine?](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-54553132)
    

It also alleges that Burisma made two $5m (£3.9m) payments to "the Bidens" as part of its efforts to remove Ukraine's prosecutor general at the time, Viktor Shokin - and that there were audio recordings of both Hunter and Joe Biden that supported this.

The informant told the FBI he had learned these details during conversations he had with the Burisma chief executive and other company officials in 2015 or 2016.

! <image:5917>!Getty Images Chuck Grassley <image:5920>Getty Images

Chuck Grassley said releasing the FBI document was in the public interest

Vice-President Biden had publicly pressed for Mr Shokin's removal as part of a larger effort by the Obama administration and US allies due to concerns that he was ineffective in tackling corruption in Ukraine.

Mr Grassley, an Iowa senator, says he obtained a lightly redacted copy of the memo from a justice department "whistleblower" and decided releasing it was in the public interest.

He and other Republicans have said the FBI considers the informant to be highly credible, but the report details how the informant said he could not vouch for the accuracy of the information he was passing along.

Mr Grassley [tweeted a copy of the memo](https://twitter.com/ChuckGrassley/status/1682081403742068746)
 on Thursday. He said voters could now make their own minds up "without the filter of politicians or bureaucrats".

Its public release, however, is a highly unusual move and could further inflame tensions between congressional Republicans and the FBI and Biden administration officials.

Since regaining a majority last year in the House of Representatives after four years of Democratic control, Republicans have launched a range of investigations into President Biden and his family.

The allegations detailed in the FBI document are similar to ones aired over the past several years by Mr Biden's political opponents, including former Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who had repeatedly travelled to Ukraine to conduct his own personal investigations.

Mr Giuliani's accusations against the Bidens became a focus of Mr Trump's first impeachment trial in 2019, which centred on the then-president's efforts to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to announce he was launching an investigation into Joe Biden's supposed ties to Burisma.

During a September 2023 conversation with investigators, Smirnov also claimed the Russians probably had recordings of Hunter Biden because a hotel in Ukraine’s capital where he had stayed was “wired” and under their control — information he said was passed along to him by four high-level Russian officials.

But Hunter Biden had never traveled to Ukraine, according to Smirnov’s indictment.

Smirnov claimed to have contacts with Russian intelligence-affiliated officials, and told authorities after his arrest this year that “officials associated with Russian intelligence were involved in passing a story” about Hunter Biden.

The case against Smirnov was brought by special counsel David Weiss, who also prosecuted Hunter Biden on gun and tax charges. [PBS News](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/ "PBS News")

Former FBI informant pleads guilty to lying about fake bribery scheme involving the Bidens
==========================================================================================

[Politics](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics)
 Updated on Dec 16, 2024 1:23 PM EDT — Published on Dec 16, 2024 10:21 AM EDT

LOS ANGELES (AP) — A former FBI informant pleaded guilty on Monday to lying about a phony bribery scheme involving President Joe Biden and his son Hunter that became central to the Republican [impeachment inquiry](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/tag/biden-impeachment-inquiry)
 in Congress.

Alexander Smirnov entered his plea to a felony charge in connection with the [bogus story](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/ex-fbi-informant-charged-with-fabricating-biden-family-bribery-scheme-to-appear-in-court)
, along with a tax evasion charge stemming from a separate indictment accusing him of concealing millions of dollars of income.

An attorney for Smirnov, 44, declined to comment after the hearing in Los Angeles federal court.

Prosecutors and the defense have agreed to recommend a sentence of between four and six years in prison when he’s sentenced next month.

**READ MORE:** [Ex-FBI informant charged with fabricating Biden family bribery scheme to remain in custody before trial](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/ex-fbi-informant-charged-with-fabricating-biden-family-bribery-scheme-to-appear-in-court)

Smirnov will get credit for the time he has served since his February arrest on charges that he told his FBI handler that executives from the Ukrainian energy company Burisma had paid President Biden and Hunter Biden $5 million each around 2015.

Smirnov had been an informant for more than a decade when he made the explosive allegations about the Bidens in June 2020, after “expressing bias” about Joe Biden as a presidential candidate, prosecutors said.

But Smirnov had only routine business dealings with Burisma starting in 2017, according to court documents. An FBI field office investigated the allegations and recommended the case be closed in August 2020, according to charging documents.

No evidence has emerged that Joe Biden acted corruptly or accepted bribes as president or in his previous office as vice president.

While Smirnov’s identity wasn’t publicly known before the indictment, his claims played a major part in the Republican effort in Congress to investigate the president and his family, and helped spark a House impeachment inquiry into Biden. Hunter Biden was supposed to be sentenced this month after being convicted at a trial in the gun case and pleading guilty to federal charges in the tax case."

Senate minority leader **Mitch McConnell** might be on board with **Joe Biden**’s request for a more than $100 billion supplemental funding package that couples support for Israel with more aid to Ukraine. “If he wants to sell the American people on $60 billion more to Ukraine, he shouldn’t use dead Israeli children to do it.”

But in a _Face the Nation_ [interview](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mitch-mcconnell-senate-minority-leader-face-the-nation-transcript-10-22-2023/)
 that aired Sunday, McConnell criticized that sentiment. “It is a vital interest that we contain and settle the crisis in Ukraine.” The memo also accused Ukraine of struggling “with deeply-rooted corruption.” (Of course, the Israeli government has its own corruption problems: Prime Minister **Benjamin Netanyahu** has sought to neuter judicial power in the country in an apparent attempt to quash an ongoing bribery and fraud trial against him.)

Vance shared a far less polite version of the memo’s arguments during a Thursday [appearance](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/vance-accuses-biden-using-israels-fight-hamas-push-more-ukraine-aid-disgusting)
 on _Hannity,_ in which he said it was “completely disgraceful” for Biden to link a “Ukrainian escalation” with Israel’s war against Hamas. Per Politico, he shared a memo with other senators on Monday that urged against linking aid for Ukraine and Israel, claiming that “Israel has an achievable objective; Ukraine does not.”

The funding request [includes](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/20/us/politics/bidens-funds-israel-ukraine.html)
 an additional $61.4 billion for Ukraine—which has [already received](https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-aid-has-us-sent-ukraine-here-are-six-charts)
 more than $75 billion in US aid—as well as $14.3 billion for Israel, $9.1 billion for humanitarian aid in Ukraine, Israel, and Gaza, $7.4 billion for Taiwan and the Indo-Pacific, and a carve-out for border security.

In the [memo](https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000018b-5a62-d125-ab9b-7eff8ac00000&nname=playbook&nid=0000014f-1646-d88f-a1cf-5f46b7bd0000&nrid=0000016f-ab6b-da35-adff-effb363b0000&nlid=630318)
, Vance insisted that support for the two US allies should be separated. “Israeli operations will help secure the Gaza Strip; the Ukraine war has jeopardized the European security architecture and threatens global disorder,” it read. “I know there are some Republicans in the Senate, and maybe more in the House, saying Ukraine is somehow different. “Iranian drones are being used in Ukraine and against the Israelis,” he said.

Vance is one of the nine Senate Republicans who last week [wrote a letter opposing](https://www.marshall.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/FINAL_Letter-on-keeping-Israel-and-Ukraine-aid-separate.pdf)
 bundling funds for Ukraine and Israel; meanwhile, **Tom Cotton,** a Republican senator from Arkansas, has separately [threatened](https://jewishinsider.com/2023/10/republicans-supplemental-funding-israel-ukraine-palestinians/)
 to kill the funding package over the humanitarian aid it could provide to those living in the Gaza Strip. A number of House Republicans have also questioned the proposal, including former Speaker **Kevin McCarthy** and House Judiciary chairman **Jim Jordan.** However, Republicans **Michael McCaul,** the House Foreign Affairs chairman, and **Mike Turner,** the House Intelligence chairman, both [expressed support](https://www.axios.com/2023/10/22/israel-ukraine-aid-biden-gop)
 Sunday for the White House’s funding request.

Content: "“This is not a stalemate.” Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky was one of 22 Republican senators to back the package, while 26 opposed it.

The divide within the party was on stark display Friday with the prison death of Russian opposition figure and anti-corruption advocate [Alexei Navalny](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/world-leaders-blame-putins-government-in-russia-for-death-of-alexei-navalny)
, which President Joe Biden and other world leaders blamed on Putin.

[Tillis responded](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-live-biden-delivers-remarks-on-death-of-imprisoned-russian-dissident-alexei-navalny)
 to the death by saying in a post, “History will not be kind to those in America who make apologies for Putin and praise Russian autocracy.”

Johnson, the House speaker, issued a statement calling Putin a “vicious dictator” and pledging that he “will be met with united opposition,” but he did not offer any way forward for passing the aid to Ukraine.

Within the Republican Party, skeptics of confronting Russia seem to be gaining ground.

“Nearly every Republican Senator under the age of 55 voted NO on this America Last bill,” Missouri Sen. aid for Ukraine exemplifies GOP’s softening stance on Russia
=============================================================================

[World](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world)
 Feb 19, 2024 11:32 AM EDT

At about 2 a.m. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin stood on the Senate floor and explained why he opposed sending more aid to help Ukraine fend off the invasion launched in 2022 by Russian President Vladimir Putin.

“I don’t like this reality,” Johnson said. Among them, Putin is holding himself out as an international champion of conservative Christian values and the GOP is growing [increasingly skeptical of overseas entanglements](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-opposing-ukraine-funding-plays-into-putins-hands-biden-warns)
. Then there’s Trump’s personal embrace of the Russian leader.

Now the GOP’s ambivalence on Russia has [stalled additional aid](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/gop-speaker-johnson-says-house-wont-be-rushed-to-approve-aid-for-ukraine-as-95-billion-package-stalls)
 to Ukraine at [a pivotal time](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/russia-claims-control-of-avdiivka-after-outnumbered-ukrainian-defenders-withdrew)
 in the war.

The Senate last week passed a foreign aid package that included $61 billion for Ukraine on a 70-29 vote, but Johnson was one of a majority of the Republicans to vote against the bill after their late-night stand to block it. In the Republican-controlled House, Speaker Mike Johnson said his chamber will not be “rushed” to pass the measure, even as Ukraine’s military warns of dire shortages of ammunition and artillery.

Many Republicans are openly frustrated that their colleagues don’t see the benefits of helping Ukraine. Putin and his allies have banked on democracies [wearying of aiding Kyiv](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/putin-vows-no-peace-in-ukraine-until-russia-meets-its-unchanged-military-goals)
, and Putin’s GOP critics warn that NATO countries in eastern Europe could become targets of an emboldened Russia that believes the U.S. Things are changing just not fast enough.”

Those who oppose additional Ukraine aid bristle at charges that they are doing [Putin’s handiwork](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/russia-claims-control-of-avdiivka-after-outnumbered-ukrainian-defenders-withdrew)
. Matt Gaetz, a leading opponent of Ukraine aid in the House, described the movement as “a generational shift in my party away from neoconservatism toward foreign policy realism.”

In interviews with voters waiting to see Trump speak Saturday night in Waterford Township, Michigan, none praised Putin. That’s one reason Trump’s 2016 promise to avoid “stupid wars” resonated.

“Some of it may be a bottom-up change in a key part of the Republican base,” Kriner said, “and part of it reflects Trump’s hold on that base and his ability to sway its opinions and policy preferences in dramatic ways.”

Trump has long praised Putin, calling his invasion of Ukraine “smart” and “savvy,” and recalling this month that he had told NATO members who didn’t spend enough on defense that he would “encourage” Russia to “[do whatever the hell they want](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-says-he-told-nato-ally-to-spend-more-on-defense-or-he-would-encourage-russia-to-do-whatever-the-hell-they-want)
” to them."

HUNT VALLEY, Md. The debate over Ukraine aid nearly shut down the government last weekend.

The fact that “corruption” is a major topic in debates over it now could be a bad sign for Ukraine. strategy document [obtained](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/10/02/biden-admin-ukraine-strategy-corruption-00119237 "https://www.politico.com/news/2023/10/02/biden-admin-ukraine-strategy-corruption-00119237")

“Perceptions of high-level corruption” could “undermine the Ukrainian public’s and foreign leader’s confidence in the war-time government,” the confidential document warned.

It goes on to say if Kyiv doesn’t ramp up its anti-graft effort, Western allies may abandon Ukraine’s fight against Russia’s invasion. officials, but it got lost in the wake of Russia’s invasion, as defending Ukraine became ‘defending democracy against autocracy.’ While the White House tried to keep quiet on those concerns in order to shore up support for aid, it quietly emphasized the need to cut down on corruption.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky appeared to be listening."

Could this 1 word replace 'quid pro quo'?

Washington CNN  — 

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi argued on Thursday that [the President’s actions in the Ukraine scandal](https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/13/politics/trump-impeachment-key-moments/index.html)
 constitute “bribery” and that President Donald Trump has admitted to it himself, the latest and most high-profile Democrat to use that word when describing Trump’s conduct.

“What the President has admitted to and says it’s perfect, I’ve said it’s perfectly wrong. Trump [has repeatedly claimed](https://www.reuters.com/video/2019/10/02/trump-repeatedly-defends-ukraine-call-as?videoId=607606131)
 that his now-famous July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was “perfect.”

During the call, which is now at the center of the House impeachment inquiry, Trump asks the Ukrainian President for “a favor” and goes on to suggest that Ukraine look into the family of 2020 Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden, [according to a publicly released transcript,](https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/25/politics/donald-trump-ukraine-transcript-call/index.html)
 and foreign interference in the 2016 US election.

Asked to explain what she believes the bribe was in the case of the President’s contacts with Ukraine, Pelosi said, “The bribe is to grant or withhold military assistance in return for a public statement of a fake investigation into the elections. That’s bribery.”

Pelosi’s comments come a day after the first public hearing in the impeachment inquiry, which featured testimony from the top US diplomat in Ukraine, [Bill Taylor](https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/21/politics/who-is-bill-taylor/index.html)
, and Deputy Assistant Secretary of State [George Kent](https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/15/politics/who-is-george-kent/index.html)
.

Public hearings mark the start of the next phase in the inquiry, where House Democrats will be under increasing pressure to make a compelling case to the American public about the President’s actions.

One of the challenges facing Democrats is whether they can clearly explain what they believe is at stake and describe the alleged wrongdoing.

Congressional Republicans have defended the President, arguing that his actions do not amount to impeachable conduct and that Democrats are pushing a partisan inquiry and have been looking for any excuse to attempt to get the President out of office since he was elected.

The White House has similarly dismissed the inquiry. “That’s what the inquiry is about.”

Pelosi further argued that the Trump-Ukraine controversy is more serious than the Watergate scandal, saying what the President did “makes what Nixon did look almost small.”

“What President Trump has done on the record in terms of acting to advantage his – a foreign power to help him in his own election and the obstruction of information about that, the cover-up, makes what Nixon did look almost small.”

Ad Feedback “This sham hearing is not only boring, it is a colossal waste of taxpayer time & money,” White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham tweeted on Wednesday in response to the first public hearing of the inquiry.

In contrast, Pelosi on Thursday called the recent testimony “devastating” and said it “corroborated evidence of bribery.”

“The devastating testimony corroborated evidence of bribery uncovered in the inquiry and that the President abused power and violated his oath by threatening to withhold military aid and a White House meeting in exchange for an investigation into his political rival,” Pelosi said, adding, “A clear attempt by the President to give himself the advantage in the 2020 election.”

House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, has also raised the accusation of bribery.

[In an interview with NPR](https://www.npr.org/2019/11/12/778524552/transcript-nprs-full-interview-with-rep-adam-schiff-on-impeachment-inquiry)
 on Tuesday, Schiff cited bribery as a potentially impeachable offense.

“I don’t think any decision has been made on the ultimate question about whether articles of impeachment should be brought,” Schiff said, adding, “That will be the purpose of these hearings and the subsequent work done in the Judiciary Committee. But on the basis of what the witnesses have had to say so far, there are any number of potentially impeachable offenses, including bribery, including high crimes and misdemeanors.”

Pelosi was asked during her news conference if bribery could be an article of impeachment against the President.

“I don’t know about that."

Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi says President Trump committed bribery by conditioning military aid to Ukraine upon the Ukrainian government granting Trump “a favor” by investigating former Vice President Joe Biden. And what is the White House saying?
    
*   **Yamiche Alcindor:**
    
    Speaker Nancy Pelosi is trying to put in the simplest terms possible what she describes as President Trump's trying to bribe or extort Ukraine in exchange for an investigation into Joe Biden and Hunter Biden.
    
    So Democrats want to make that point simply because they think that Americans who are just tuning in might not understand the Latin term quid pro quo, which is what a lot of people in Washington, D.C., including some Democrats, have been saying in describing President Trump's alleged actions.
    
    So she's really trying to get Democrats, as well as the American public, to use start using the term bribery, because she wants that to be what people think of as they think about the impeachment inquiries and what President Trump is being accused of.
    
    The White House is pushing back on that. House of Representatives is flatly accusing President Trump of bribery a day before the second public hearing on impeachment is scheduled.
    
    Nancy Pelosi pointed today to what Mr. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.:**
    
    The bribe is to grant or withhold military assistance in return for a public statement of a fake investigation into the elections. Pelosi's words are significant because the Constitution explicitly mentions bribery as grounds for impeachment. Trump called a favor, asking the president of Ukraine to investigate Democrats, the 2016 election and the Bidens.
    
*   **Rep. It's bribery.
    
*   **Judy Woodruff:**
    
    Pelosi's word choice is significant because the Constitution explicitly mentions bribery as grounds for impeachment.
    
    Meanwhile, the Associated Press reports that a second U.S. Embassy staffer in Kiev overheard President Trump discussing Ukraine and the investigations he wanted in a cell phone call. She was the ambassador to the Ukraine for the U.S. Democrats are going to be making the case that she was the first casualty when it comes to President Trump's alleged scheme to pressure Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden.
    
    So they're going to be making the case that she's not a victim, per se — they have stopped using that term — but that she is someone that should be sympathetic to the American people.
    
    I have heard and aides have told me that she cried during her deposition, so tomorrow might be an emotional day.
    
    We should also be looking forward to the deposition of David Holmes."

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results discuss allegations of corruption involving Joe Biden and Ukraine. One source, from Wikipedia, discusses the Biden–Ukraine conspiracy theory, which alleges that Joe Biden took a bribe to pressure Ukraine, but states that there is no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe Biden. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biden%E2%80%93Ukraine_conspiracy_theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biden%E2%80%93Ukraine_conspiracy_theory))

Another source, from BBC News, discusses an FBI document detailing an allegation that Joe Biden and his son accepted bribes from a Ukrainian firm, but there is no evidence that Joe Biden received any payments from Ukraine. ([https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66272217](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66272217)) A PBS News article reports that a former FBI informant pleaded guilty to lying about a bribery scheme involving Joe Biden and Hunter Biden, and that no evidence has emerged that Joe Biden acted corruptly or accepted bribes.

An F-16 Fighting Falcon rests inside a warehouse near March Air Reserve Base after crashing on May 16, 2019. The missiles on board did not explode. The plane suffered a loss of hydraulic pressure, rendering the pilot unable to control the jet, the U.S. Air Force said April 23, 2020. (Courtesy of U.S. Air Force)

The U.S. Air Force has answered a questioned that burned in people’s minds as bystanders were hurriedly pushed back to safer locations several times and the 215 Freeway was closed after [the crash of an Air National Guard F-16 fighter jet](https://www.pressenterprise.com/2019/05/16/plane-crashes-near-march-air-reserve-base-215-freeway-shut-down/)
 near March Air Reserve Base in 2019:

Why didn’t the missiles aboard the Flying Falcon explode on impact?

The reason, the Air Force said this week, is that the ordnance attached to the F-16 during its intercept training mission were never armed.

“Aircraft flying this mission do fly with live ordnance. In order for the weapons to detonate, there are multiple conditions that must be met, including arming and launching of the weapon to complete the detonation sequences,” said Capt. Tisha J. Yates, an Air Force spokeswoman at Joint Base Langley-Eustis in Virginia.

The missiles were eventually removed from the jet as it sat in a warehouse on Opportunity Way near the Riverside-Moreno Valley border. They were trucked to nearby Ben Clark Training Center, [where they were destroyed in a controlled detonation](https://www.pressenterprise.com/2019/05/17/x-9/)
.

“The determination to move civilians away from the scene was a safety measure put in place by the incident commander on scene and in coordination with NORAD based on the hazards present until all munitions were secured,” Yates said in response to questions from this news organization, [which first reported the cause of the crash](https://www.pressenterprise.com/2020/04/23/hydraulic-failure-caused-f-16-to-crash-near-march-base-last-year-air-force-says/)
.

The F-16 was assigned to the 114th Fighter Wing at Joe Foss Field in South Dakota. The pilot was attached to the 144th Fighter Wing at March.

On May 16, 2019, the pilot was returning from the two-jet maneuvers about 120 miles east of March when he lost hydraulic pressure and therefore the ability to control the aircraft. At 3:39 p.m., after burning off fuel, he ejected about 250 feet off the ground less than a mile from the base. The pilot suffered minor injuries, as did about a dozen people in the warehouse where the plane crashed.

The Air Force concluded in its 22-page accident report that the $24 million jet lost the fluid from its two hydraulic tanks when two inlet check valves — each less than an inch tall — failed because they were improperly installed.

Each valve consists of a cap, screw threads, a retainer ring and an O-ring that collectively are referred to as a screw cap. That screw cap screws into the valve body. The retainer helps keep the O-ring in place. It is primarily the screw cap retainer and O-ring that prevent hydraulic fluid from leaking under high pressure.

The investigation determined that both screw caps were not properly screwed into the valve bodies. The retainers were found to be deformed, and portions of the O-rings were missing. As a result, hydraulic fluid leaked out through the threads between the screw caps and the valve bodies.

A suspected hydraulic leak had been noted in the jet in March 2019. A new flight-control system that had been overhauled months earlier was installed on March 28, and the plane flew 10 more missions without incident before the crash. The report concluded that the overhaul process lacked “an effective procedure to identify improper installation of ISA check valves.” ISA stands for Integrated Servo Actuator, a flight-control system.

In the wake of the crash, the Air Force also said this week that it studied the overhaul process and found a problem with how the inlet check valve was assembled during overhauls, said Derek Kaufman, a civilian spokesman for the Air Force Materiel Command at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio.

There are two approved configurations of the valves. The older configuration uses smaller Teflon backing rings, and newer configurations use larger rings. The team discovered the potential for installation of the wrong-size backing ring since both size rings were packaged side by side, Kaufman said.

As a result, the Air Force changed the process for assembling the valves during overhauls. It separated the installation and inspection steps on the work documentation and added a secondary quality check for just O-ring backing ring installation. And it inserted a “quality stamp” of the entire process for the first six months after the changes to ensure proper training was accomplished.

The Air Force also inspected all of its inlet check valves and found three to be defective. Those were fixed, Kaufman said.

“We review the facts for any lessons that can be applied to maintenance processes and training to improve the safety and quality of systems we deliver to our warfighters,” he said.

The improper installation of two parts caused an [F-16](/weapons/f-16/ "Learn more about the F-16 Fighting Falcon")
‘s hydraulic system to fail, making the pilot [lose control and crash into a warehouse in May 2019](https://www.airforcemag.com/f-16-crashes-during-norad-training-in-california/)
 while flying back to March Air Reserve Base, Calif., Air Force investigators found.

The F-16 pilot successfully ejected before the Viper crashed into the civilian building. The aircraft was destroyed at a loss of $24.99 million, and caused about $3.9 million in damage to the warehouse, according to an Air Combat Command Accident Investigation Board report.

The F-16C, tail number 88-0477 from the South Dakota Air National Guard’s 114th Fighter Wing, was operated by a pilot from the California Air National Guard’s 144th Fighter Wing Detachment 1 at March for homeland defense missions. On May 16, 2019, the F-16C took off as part of a two-ship formation for an aerospace control alert training mission in a nearby military operating area.

The two F-16s flew one-versus-one tactical intercepts, low-level proficiency training, and local area familiarization. While flying near Palm Springs, the pilot began receiving cockpit warnings of a potential hydraulic system issue with gauges showing low pressure and began going through appropriate checklists, according to the report.

About 20 miles from base, the pilot deployed speed brakes and lowered the landing gear to burn more fuel and let the wingman visually inspect the aircraft. With the speed brakes and gear deployed and locked, the pilot did not yet declare an emergency, but continued the approach to March, the report states.

The aircraft then indicated further loss of pressure in both of its “A and B” systems, and the pilot consulted checklists for dual hydraulic failure. Once they got close to the base, the wingman landed first on one of the base’s runways, allowing the damaged F-16 to land on a runway with an arresting cable.

With both hydraulic systems failing, the pilot declared an emergency and turned on emergency power as a precaution before starting a straight-in approach to the runway. About one mile before touching down, at about 300 feet above ground level, the F-16 began to roll to the left without any pilot input. The pilot tried to maintain control, and counter the roll, but the aircraft rolled hard to the right in a way that was inconsistent with the pilot’s input.

After losing control of the aircraft, the pilot ejected. Immediately after punching out, the F-16 crashed into the warehouse, located across a major highway from the base. A photograph of the impact shows the F-16’s nose sheared off and wings largely removed in a pile of boxes and equipment. The pilot parachuted onto the runway overrun at the base, and was briefly hospitalized with minor injuries.

The Accident Investigation Board found that the cause of the mishap was two improperly installed hydraulic check valves in the aircraft’s right flaperon integrated survoactuator—a part that translates electrical commands to the movement of flight control surfaces. For both of the parts that failed, investigators found the same problem: the retainer on a screw cap had deformed, with fragments tearing away allowing fluid to leak.

“This condition allowed hydraulic fluid to leak from both systems resulting in decreased hydraulic pressure to move flight control surfaces,” the report said. “The \[pilot\] set up to land as soon as possible, but the system had lost enough pressure on final approach to prevent the \[aircraft\] from sustaining controlled flight.”

Maintainers with the 144th Fighter Wing Detachment 1 installed the parts as part of unscheduled maintenance in March 2019 after a possible hydraulic leak was discovered. The parts went through operational checks with no discrepancies found, and the aircraft had flown 10 sorties for 16.3 hours before the crash. The AIB states that there was an inadequate overhaul process, which lacked an effective procedure to identify problems with the installation of the check valves.

A loss of hydraulic pressure prevented the pilot of the Air National Guard’s F-16 [that crashed near March Air Reserve Base](https://www.pe.com/2019/05/16/plane-crashes-near-march-air-reserve-base-215-freeway-shut-down/)
 last year from controlling the jet, the U.S. Air Force says in a report.

The pilot ejected and parachuted onto a base runway on May 16, 2019, suffering minor injuries. The $24 million Fighting Falcon plummeted through the roof of a warehouse, destroying the jet and causing a small fire.

Twelve people in the warehouse were treated for exposure to the debris, the Cal Fire/Riverside County Fire Department said at the time.

The 22-page report, dated April 14, said two inlet-check valves were improperly installed, resulting in damage to them that caused hydraulic fuel to leak.

The valves were part of a flight-control system that was overhauled in January 2019 and installed in the jet after a possible hydraulic leak was discovered several months later.

“The evidence also indicated an inadequate overhaul process that lacked an effective procedure to identify improper installation of ISA check valves,” the report says.

The F-16 was one of two jets initially practicing 120 miles east of March, which sits on the Riverside-Moreno Valley border. The planes were returning to March when the one jet lost hydraulic pressure.

The pilot burned off fuel before ejecting, the report says.

The F-16 was assigned to the 114th Fighter Wing at Joe Foss Field in South Dakota and ran some missions for the 144th Fighter Wing at March.

### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (<image:22>) shows the wreckage of an F-16 that crashed into a warehouse near March Air Reserve Base, Calif., in May 2019. The crash was caused by improperly installed parts in the aircraft's hydraulic system. The pilot ejected and survived. The Press-Enterprise published an article on May 1, 2020, about the crash, and the article explains that the missiles on board did not explode because they were not armed.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image depicts the wreckage of an F-16 fighter jet that crashed near March Air Reserve Base in California in May 2019. The crash was due to improperly installed parts in the aircraft's hydraulic system, not because it was shot down. The pilot ejected and survived. The claim that the image shows a Ukrainian F-16 shot down by Russia is therefore false.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

 в Харьковской области российские оккупанты потеряли очень много живой силы и техники.

Подробности феерического отступления россиян появляются в сети.

Украинский журналист Денис Казанский [опубликовал](https://t.me/kazansky2017/3989)
 красноречивое фото, на котором два бойца ВСУ "селфятся" на фоне лежащего на земле "орка".

"_Теперь уже можно! Балаклея - это Украина!_", - подписан кадр.

Кроме того, в Балаклее у оккупантов очень большие потери. Россияне драпали так быстро, что [бросали](https://t.me/kazansky2017/3991?single)
 тела погибших сослуживцев.

Разгром российской армии в Балаклее стал расплатой за Иловайск в 2014 году, [отмечает](https://t.me/kazansky2017/3994)
 журналист, добавляя, что на дорогах в округе повсюду разбитая и брошенная техника оккупантов.

Еще один украинский журналист Анатолий Цаплиенко [сообщает](https://t.me/Tsaplienko/15021)
, что россияне пробовали убежать, но на дороге их встретила засада украинских бойцов. Чем все закончилось, можно посмотреть на видео.

Напомним, Президент Украины [Владимир Зеленский официально подтвердил освобождение города Балаклеи в Харьковской области от российских оккупантов](https://apostrophe.ua/news/society/2022-09-08/teper-ofitsialno-zelenskiy-podtverdil-osvobojdenie-balaklei-ot-okkupantov/278876)

##### Президент Зеленский предположил, что война может завершиться в 2026 году. Верите ли вы в это?

Да, это возможно

Нет, сомневаюсь

!Оккупанты понесли огромные потери при паническом бегстве из Балаклеи <image:2752>

Многие российские военные попали в засаду.

При бегстве из Балаклеи в Харьковской области российские оккупанты потеряли очень много живой силы и техники.

Подробности феерического отступления россиян появляются в сети, сообщает [«Апостроф»](https://apostrophe.ua/news/society/2022-09-08/rasplata-za-ilovaysk-okkupantyi-ponesli-ogromnyie-poteri-pri-begstve-iz-balaklei-video/278880/)

Российские войска отступают. Как развивается украинское контрнаступление и чем успехи ВСУ последних недель грозят России — мнение экспертов и российских военных

Украина [объявила](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1018539645523163)
 о контрнаступлении на юге страны в Херсонской области 29 августа, а 6 сентября начала наступательную операцию на востоке — в Харьковской области. За это время украинская армия освободила десятки населенных пунктов и продвинулась вглубь российских оборонительных позиций. Поступают сообщения о том, что российские войска отступают из стратегически важных городов — Балаклеи, Купянска, Изюма, Волчанска и Лимана. Военные эксперты называют события последних двух недель невообразимым [успехом](https://republic.ru/posts/105163)

### **Российские войска не могут держать оборону и бегут**

«8 лет говорили что и когда будут делать: один треп, обо всем со всех щелей. Никакой тактики, никакого профессионализма, никакого ума. Когда на это \[контрнаступление ВСУ\] смотрим мы \[военные\], мы понимаем, что изначально все было сделано неправильно. Но забили на это хуй, начали двигаться дальше криво, коряво. А с другой \[украинской\] стороны, люди просто взяли, увидели это, соорганизовались, все сделали. ‎

Поэтому в плане войны все выглядит очень логично: мы начали как долбоебы, не смогли ничего удержать, всё разъебали, один сплошной пиздеж вокруг, командования ноль, обеспечения ноль, руководства ноль. И вот изначально было понятно, что будет заканчиваться тем, что нас просто разнесут», — комментирует «‎Важным историям»‎ ситуацию на фронте бывший российский военнослужащий, который участвовал в войне в Украине. «Вспоминаю, как долго \[ВС РФ\] ковыряли Мариуполь и Северодонецк, а тут два дня \[понадобилось ВСУ\]. \[При том, что\] Изюм чуть ли не с первых дней войны был под контролем \[российских войск\], то есть они даже не планировали и не думали, что его, возможно, придется оборонять», — недоумевает другой бывший российский военный.

‎Всего за несколько дней с начала контрнаступления украинской армии удалось освободить более 30 населенных пунктов Харьковской области, [объявил](https://t.me/V_Zelenskiy_official/3190)
 президент Украины Владимир Зеленский 9 сентября. На следующий день появились сообщения о том, что украинские войска вошли в Купянск, оккупированный российскими войсками в начале войны, об этом [рассказала](https://www.facebook.com/popova.natali/posts/pfbid0zaYm5vKnHk3gzPxJTwZeCWc2srUk9ksF517syxzGiC6UZEQA27TKxhSDtkXjHXkMl)

Синим цветом обозначены территории, освобожденные за последние две недели, зеленым — освобожденные ранее территории, красным — оккупированные территории Источник: Украинский проект deepstatemap. Последнее обновление: 10 сентября, 18:23

При этом, в [брифинге](https://t.me/mod_russia/19716)
 российского Минобороны от 10 сентября не было сказано ни слова об оставленных российскими войсками городах. Позже Минобороны [объяснило](https://t.me/mod_russia/19719)
 отступление российских войск «операцией по свертыванию и переброске Изюмско-Балаклейской группировки» для наращивания усилий по «освобождению Донбасса».

«Сейчас мы видим, как российские войска бегут, потому что не могут держать оборону», — описывает происходящее украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. Этому предшествовал первый крупный успех ВСУ в Харьковской области — освобождение 8 сентября города Балаклея, который был оккупирован с марта. «Это место, где сосредоточены склады с боеприпасами для артиллерии, поэтому \[ее освобождение\] достаточно серьезно усилит огневые возможности ВСУ», — говорит военный эксперт.

Именно освобождение Балаклеи позволило ВСУ лишить российскую группировку, которая там сконцентрирована, возможности держать оборону, поскольку отрезало их от «логистической артерии» Волчанск-Большой Бурлук-Купянск-Изюм, по которой происходило снабжение армии, объясняет эксперт. «Без снабжения вся эта масса личного состава и техники, сконцентрированная на Изюмском направлении, оказалась бы не боеспособной», — говорит Коваленко.

По словам российского военного эксперта Юрия Федорова, у российских войск на этом направлении «очень крупные потери»: не только убитыми, но и пленными: «как минимум сотни пленных, если не пара тысяч».

Вероятное большое количество пленных подтверждают и двое бывших военнослужащих российской армии. «При спонтанном отступлении особенно много пленных. Связи внутри подразделений нет. Кто где находится, командиры не всегда знают. Соответственно, об отступлении не все могут знать», — говорят они. Бывший военнослужащий одного из элитных подразделений в разговоре с «Важными историями» отметил, что на Харьковском направлении обе стороны несут ощутимые потери. «Когда мои говорят: „Бля, там пиздец“, значит, что всё плохо», — добавил собеседник «Важных историй».

### **Почему провалилась российская оборона**

Несмотря на то, что в Харьковской области было сконцентрировано больше российских войск, чем задействовано сил ВСУ в контрнаступлении на этом участке, операция была направлена на особо уязвимые места, где возможности российских подразделений по обороне были истощены, говорит украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. «Российское командование знало, что у них есть уязвимые места в Харьковской области, они даже пытались их в значительной степени усилить. Знали, но предотвратить \[исход событий\] не могли: нехватка ресурсов уже начала сказываться на их возможностях по ведению обороны. И сейчас мы наблюдаем каскадный обвал обороны», — объясняет Александр Коваленко.

Российский военный эксперт Юрий Федоров говорит, что в Харьковской области украинская армия использовала новую тактику, которая и обеспечила успех на этом направлении. «ВСУ действуют очень динамично и фактически не задерживаются на то, чтобы штурмовать те или иные города. Они просто их обходят, берут в кольцо, и тогда гарнизоны этих городков и небольших сел просто вынуждены капитулировать, — рассказывает российский военный эксперт Юрий Федоров.

— Сейчас уже практически взят Купянск, по крайней мере, та часть, которая находится на правом берегу. Сдан Изюм или находится в процессе. Российские войска уходят оттуда, чтобы не попасть в окружение. Это, в общем, разумное решение, потому что коммуникации перерезаны. Сам по себе Изюм находится на стыке двух рек: Оскол и Северский Донец. Если его окружить, скажем, с северо-востока или с севера, то он просто будет отрезан от подвоза боеприпасов и всего прочего, и \[российская армия\] вынуждена будет капитулировать. Чтобы этого не случилось, они просто выводят войска, пока есть возможность».

Юрий Федоров считает, что ВСУ тактически и оперативно переиграли российские войска, которым не хватило ресурсов для сдерживания этого наступления. «\[Сначала\] была прорвана оборона в районе Балаклеи. А затем российские войска были разбросаны гарнизонами по различным городкам, селам. Эти гарнизоны часто состояли из Росгвардии, а также мобилизованных из так называемых народных республик.

Росгвардия в принципе воевать не умеет, она не для этого предназначена. Задача этих гарнизонов и гвардейских полков заключалась в том, чтобы держать в подчинении местное население. А среди мобилизованных многие в первый раз взяли в руки автомат, надели каску, мотивации \[у них нет\] никакой. Российские регулярные части были отведены частично на правобережье в Херсонскую область, частично на Донецкое направление, где они пытались штурмовать пригород Донецка, занятый ВСУ. Поэтому вот такой разгром», — объясняет военный эксперт.

Это же подтверждает в разговоре с «Важными историями» и российский военнослужащий, который был на этом направлении. «\[Подведомственные\] Минобороны \[войска\], группировка Восток, вышли с этого направления еще в июле в Белгородскую область. На тот момент в Изюме я встречал БАРСов (_боевой армейский резерв страны_ — **Прим. ред.**), ополченцев и войска ПВО Западного округа. После \[их\] выхода в Изюм зашёл СОБР и ОМОН. Соответственно, там действительно остались только „БАРСики“, ополченцы и Росгвардия», — говорит он.

По словам эксперта Федорова, российское командование просчиталось в оценке ситуации, когда перебросило боевые части с юга Харьковской области на другие направления до начала контрнаступления. «Считалось, что в районе расположения изюмской группировки ничего страшного случиться не может. Просчет заключался в том, что не была оценена вероятность того, что украинские войска начнут там наступление», — говорит Федоров.

«Российское командование с профессиональной точки зрения оценивают как очень слабое. Это люди, которые умеют бросать в бой значительное количество живой силы, но отсутствует инициатива в исполнении приказа. Написано „занять такой-то перекресток“, а может быть, лучше занять другой перекресток рядышком, но это недопустимая вещь, \[только\] тупое упорное выполнение приказа», — добавляет он.

«Нельзя, чтобы армия, которая строилась двадцать лет, сегодня такая: все, мы будем работать по-другому. Нас заставляли быть тупыми и не принимать никаких решений, — подтверждает бывший военнослужащий российской армии. — Попробуй сержанту скажи, что ты считаешь, что лучше вот так вот. Тебе ебало просто сломают, если не застрелят сразу. И так на всех уровнях. Верховный главнокомандующий принимает только „‎правильные“‎ решения — а все остальные должны их исполнять. И если что, они будут нести наказание, не потому что сверху долбоебы, а потому что „‎вы плохо \[приказы\] исполняете, вы не исполнительные“»‎, — говорит он.

![Український контрнаступ та звільнення міста Балаклія Харківської області та навколишніх сіл](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201280%20960'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

«Самые успешные операции за всю мою службу были те, о которых знали только мы. Только те люди, которые в ней участвуют. Потому что стоит таким заняться командованию… Поэтому когда мы сами решали, что делать, не ожидая команды сверху или пока качнут связь, чтобы уточнить, связаться, запросить разрешение на выполнение, уточнение и прочую херню, мы всегда все выполняли на 100 %», — отмечает бывший военнослужащий одного из элитных подразделений ВС РФ.

Накануне, 9 сентября, Минобороны [показало](https://t.me/mod_russia/19710)
 кадры переброски военной техники в Харьковскую область, но это подкрепление не помогло отстоять города. «Этих подкреплений крайне недостаточно, — говорит Юрий Федоров. — Даже вертолетами перебрасывали личный состав и легкую технику. Но это все равно, что пытаться из пипетки наполнить стакан, практически бессмысленная задача».

Александр Коваленко объясняет это тем, что переброска поддержки была лишь пропагандистским жестом. «Российской армии срочно понадобилось демонстрировать некую активность, что „помощь близка“, „мы своих не бросаем“, якобы они готовы оказывать поддержку тем подразделениям, которые оказались в сложной ситуации. Но эта переброска имела неорганизованный, хаотический характер, она не могла обеспечить никакой поддержки», — говорит эксперт.

По его словам, те подразделения, которые зашли в зону боевых действий для поддержки, были обречены. Многие из них давным-давно требовали ротации или вывода для восстановления боеспособности из-за понесенных до этого серьезных потерь. «В ближайшее время мы будем узнавать о большом количестве подразделений российской армии, которые попросту перестали существовать, поскольку вместо вывода на восстановление боеспособности их кинули в самую мясорубку, самое жерло боевых столкновений», — говорит он.

### **Чем российской армии грозит прорыв ВСУ**

Освобождение Купянска и Изюма важно в стратегическом смысле тем, что оно отрезает российские группировки от путей снабжения и открывает ВСУ путь на Луганское и Донецкое направление, говорит украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. «Эти города важны тем, что они являются неотъемлемой частью логистических артерий поставок техники, материально-технического обеспечения, боеприпасов, личного состава как в Харьковскую область, так и в целом на донбасский плацдарм. Купянск является очень важным логистическим узлом, сердцем этой артерии.

Через него шло обеспечение города Изюм, который стал центром сосредоточения самой большой бронетанковой группы российских оккупантов за все время полномасштабного вторжения в Украину, — говорит эксперт. — И вся эта масса должна была идти в сторону Славянска и Краматорска. Сейчас планы по захвату Славянска и Краматорска можно считать аннулированными. Потеря \[российской армией\] таких населенных пунктов как Купянск и Изюм полностью рушит систему обеспечения донбасского плацдарма и позволяет ВСУ в дальнейшем развивать контрнаступательные действия уже не только в Харьковской области, но и в Луганском и Донецком направлениях».

В ближайшие дни можно ожидать, что Харьковская область будет освобождена, уверен российский военный эксперт Юрий Федоров. «Это не решающее сражение, но очень крупный успех ВСУ», — говорит он. По его словам, тогда вооруженные силы Украины смогут перебросить значительное количество личного состава и на другие направления.

Херсонская область
------------------

### **Российской армии не хватает сил для обороны**

Еще одно не менее важное направление, на котором продолжают наступать силы ВСУ, — контролируемый российскими войсками плацдарм на правом берегу Днепра в Херсонской области. Украинское контрнаступление началось там 29 августа. В тот день, по [данным](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1018539645523163)
 оперативной группировки ВСУ «Каховка», ей удалось «прорвать первую линию обороны» в Херсонской области. «109 полк „ДНР“ отошел со своих позиций, российские десантники, которые были их поддержкой, сбежали с поля боя», — [говорилось](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1018539645523163)
 в сообщении. 4 сентября ВСУ [установили](https://www.facebook.com/kirill.timoshenko/posts/5588117717898633)
 украинский флаг в крупном населенном пункте Высокополье.

Точная численность российской группировки, которая находится на правом берегу Днепра, где Украина ведет контрнаступление, неизвестна. По разным оценкам, на начало контрнаступления там находилось от [20](https://www.currenttime.tv/a/ukraine-russia-war-kherson/31989285.html)
 до [25 тысяч](https://www.currenttime.tv/a/32011307.html)
 российских военных. Нет точных данных и о численности украинской группировки. Источник «Важных историй» из числа бывших сотрудников российской спецслужбы, пожелавший остаться анонимным, говорит, что для контрнаступления в Херсонской области Украина сформировала «довольно скромные резервы»: их численность — 10–12 тысяч человек.

Однако, по его словам, у Украины есть еще резервы, не брошенные в контрнаступление, которые не должны позволить российской стороне замкнуть окружение вокруг прорвавшихся вперед войск. Максимальную оценку украинских сил на этом фронте [приводит](https://www.currenttime.tv/a/rf-boitsya-poteryat-litso-i-poetomu-otdaet-svoih-soldat-na-myaso-na-pravom-beregu-dnepra-eksperty-o-rasklade-sil-na-yuge-ukrainy-/32011763.html)
 украинский военный эксперт Роман Свитан: по его данным, там находится 30 тысяч бойцов ВСУ.

«Теми силами, которые присутствуют сейчас на правом берегу Днепра, российская армия в среднесрочной перспективе не сможет удерживать контрнаступление ВСУ», — уверен украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. По словам аналитика Conflict Intelligence Team (CIT) Кирилла Михайлова, ВСУ удалось создать определенное превосходство в численности личного состава на основных направлениях наступления в Херсонской области. «К этому добавляется эффективная работа артиллерии и локальное превосходство Украины в воздухе, которое позволяет использовать как фронтовую авиацию, так и ударные беспилотники», — комментирует он расстановку сил.

По его словам, сейчас украинцы наступают в Херсонской области как минимум на трех направлениях: с запада; северо-запада, где они расширяют плацдарм на оккупированном \[Россией\] берегу реки Ингулец; и с севера, где им удалось взять крупный населенный пункт Высокополье и «затрофеить» большое количество военной техники российского десанта. На сегодня украинской армии удалось продвинуться на территорию более десяти населенных пунктов в Херсонской области, говорит Михайлов. «Хоть эти населенные пункты и небольшие, они являются оборонительными узлами. Пока мы видим преимущество на украинской стороне», — говорит он.

Нехватку ресурсов у российской группировки на этом направлении подтверждает и бывший сотрудник российской спецслужбы. «Из-за нехватки солдат и офицеров российские войска на фронте сосредоточены в недостаточном количестве. Людей примерно в три раза меньше, чем нужно для выполнения поставленных задач: требуется минимум одна батальонно-тактическая группа на 3 километра, а у России — одна на 5 километров. Такой численностью не наступают, это похоже на авантюру, — говорит он. — Прорвав первую линию \[обороны\] российских войск, украинское наступление должно было упереться во вторую линию, но проблема в том, что у российской военной группировки ее нет: из-за нехватки людей такие прорывы затыкают лишь мобильными резервами. И это может сделать ситуацию непредсказуемой».

Достоверных данных о потерях обеих сторон в этой схватке сейчас нет, говорит аналитик CIT Кирилл Михайлов, но судя по [публикации](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/09/04/ukraine-is-losing-fewer-soldiers-in-its-counter-offensive-than-russia-claims)
 The Economist (журналисты побывали в прифронтовом городе Николаеве, поговорили с местными врачами и не увидели там «переполненных моргов» с погибшими украинскими военными, о чем утверждает российская сторона), хоть потери украинской армии выросли с началом наступления, они не катастрофические, как это заявляет российское Минобороны. По словам бывшего сотрудника российской спецслужбы, с которым поговорили «Важные истории», потери украинской стороны высоки, потому что наступающая сторона всегда теряет больше обороняющейся.

На третий день контрнаступления в Херсонской области The Wall Street Journal [поговорила](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ukrainian-soldiers-say-they-are-advancing-in-the-south-but-at-a-cost-11661983338)
 в госпитале с ранеными украинскими солдатами, которые участвовали в операции. По их словам, бои на пути к Херсону идут крайне ожесточенные, но украинские войска продвигаются вперед. «У них много техники, но мало людей», — сказал один из украинских военных. Кроме этого, они утверждают, что некоторые российские солдаты бегут со своих позиций, бросая технику и устанавливая мины на телах погибших товарищей.

По словам одного из российских военнослужащих, который сейчас находится в Херсонской области, российская армия там находится в тяжелом положении, солдаты массово пытаются уволиться. «Две недели назад командиры нам сказали, что на нас наступление идет. А нам даже боеприпасы никак не привезти, потому что дамба разбита (_вероятно, речь идет о дамбе в Новой Каховке_ — **Прим. ред.**). Люди каждый день ходят с рапортами \[на увольнение\], но почти всем их разрывают», — написал он. Спустя две недели военный передал «Важным историям», что при обстреле чудом выжил, и «там все жестко».

Другой источник, близкий к российским военнослужащим, которые находятся на Херсонском направлении, передал, что солдаты в полном шоке, «никто ничего не понимает, гибнут пачками, потери ужасные. Некоторые вообще звонят, прощаются, мы, говорят, смертники ебучие».

### **У российской армии проблемы со снабжением**

Еще одна проблема российской группировки, которая должна сдерживать прорыв украинской армии в Херсонской области, заключается в том, что она оказалась отрезанной от всех основных путей снабжения. Ранее снабжение российской группировки на правом берегу Днепра происходило через мосты, по которым везли боеприпасы, технику, топливо и продовольствие с левого берега реки. Однако в результате ударов ВСУ все стационарные мосты через Днепр были выведены из строя, понтонные и паромные переправы постоянно подвергаются обстрелам.

«\[Исход этого противостояния на правом берегу Днепра\] зависит от того, удастся ли россиянам организовать поставки \[снабжения\] паромами, поскольку все постоянные мосты перестали функционировать. Наладить понтонные переправы через Днепр \[российской армии\] не удалось. Сейчас функционирует несколько паромных переправ — их украинцам тяжелее поражать, чем мосты, потому что паромы мобильны, сложно предугадать, где они находятся.

Однако периодически украинцы пытаются поражать скопление российской техники в местах ожидания паромов. Это должно вызывать значительные проблемы со снабжением. Насколько россиянам хватит ресурсов для противостояния, зависит от того, смогут ли они эффективно перебрасывать подкрепление, а также от того, сколько продержатся силы ВДВ, пока у них не закончится техника, которая не отличается бронированностью», — говорит аналитик CIT Кирилл Михайлов.

### **Чем России грозит продвижение ВСУ** 

Освобождение украинскими войсками населенного пункта Высокополье в Херсонской области 4 сентября сделало невозможным для российской армии ведение наступательных действий в направлении Кривого Рога в Днепропетровской области, говорит украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. «Это была крайняя северная точка, откуда россияне могли развернуть наступательную операцию в Криворожском направлении. В настоящее время эти возможности у них отсутствуют, — объясняет он.

— Кроме того, благодаря Высокополью ВСУ получили возможность расширить плацдарм в правобережной части Херсонской области и сформировать условия для контрнаступления на достаточно угрожающем участке для многих подразделений ВС РФ. Если ВСУ будут достаточно успешно развивать наступательные действия, то мы сможем говорить о том, что огромное количество российских подразделений может оказаться фактически в окружении».

Стратегический и политический смысл операции на Херсонском направлении для Украины в том, чтобы разгромить российскую группировку на правом берегу Днепра и освободить Херсон, считает аналитик CIT Кирилл Михайлов. «Это позволит задействовать экономические ресурсы области, а также продемонстрировать западным партнерам Украины \[поставщикам оружия\], что страна в состоянии наступать и выигрывать — нужно только больше \[поставок\] оружия.

Кроме этого, в долгосрочной перспективе ликвидация правобережного плацдарма устраняет перспективу наступления \[российской армии\] на Николаев, Кривой Рог и Одессу, потому что именно захват мостов и выход на правый берег Днепра был самым значительным успехом россиян на первом этапе операции. Ликвидация этого плацдарма сильно снижает угрозу всей правобережной Украине, в том числе западному Черноморью, которое критически важно для Украины с точки зрения, например, экспорта сельхозпродукции», — объясняет эксперт значимость операции на этом направлении.

Где еще наступают ВСУ и какая битва будет решающей
--------------------------------------------------

Кроме Херсонской и Харьковской областей, ВСУ осуществляют наступательные действия в Донецкой области, говорит украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. В частности освобожден населенный пункт Озерное в Донецкой области. «Аналогичные новости будут поступать и из Луганской области, где значительно активизировались ВСУ, воспользовавшись ослаблением российских подразделений после достаточно продолжительного воздействия на них огневым потенциалом», — уверен эксперт.

По мнению Коваленко, решающей для этой войны битвой станет контрнаступление украинской армии в Запорожской области. «Битва за правобережную Херсонщину — это очень важный промежуточный этап. После ее завершения и освобождения Херсона будет освобождена и значительная часть ресурсов ВСУ, которые были задействованы для сдерживания российских оккупантов и для ведения этой контрнаступательной операции. И эти ресурсы могут быть использованы на других направлениях: Запорожской, Харьковской, Донецкой и Луганской областях.

Они сыграют решающую роль в значительном ускорении, увеличении активности и интенсивности действий ВСУ. Для командования российских войск очень важно сохранять контроль именно над Запорожской областью. Ее потеря для россиян — это фактически выстрел в висок, поскольку это станет потерей всего юга, а потеря всего юга — это и потеря Крыма. Выйдя в Запорожскую область, ВСУ получат возможность блокировать Крым с материковой части Украины и нанести удары по Керченскому мосту — то есть отрезать его от материковой части России и начать операцию по освобождению Крыма», — говорит он.

«Что война проиграна, можно было легко судить, когда не получилось взять Киев. Плюс сейчас начинается слякоть, холода, потом зима. И такие простые вещи как теплая одежда, нормальная обувь и место для ночлега, будут влиять как на на здоровье, так и на отношение людей на фронте к войне, — говорит бывший российский военный. — Это трагичный конец, которого мы и ожидали. Война работает в обе стороны: за что боролись, на то и напоролись. В наше руководство я не верю, конечно. Как родина нас кидает, мы и так знаем. Уже кинула, начиная с 14-го \[года\] — заканчивая сегодня. Сами это дерьмо устроили, естественно, мы охуеть как насосемся теперь. Проблема в том, что мы изначально на проигравшей и некомпетентной стороне были. Родина сначала кинула мясом, а теперь бросила умирать. И у этого нет ни цели, ни мотива, никакой пользы никому — ни единому человеку».

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image shows individuals wearing uniforms with what appears to be the American flag. The claim states that these are American mercenaries participating in Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024.

The evidence does not provide any information about the location or the date of the image. It also does not confirm that the individuals are mercenaries or that they are involved in any military action.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available information. Additional information is needed to confirm the location, date, and the identity of the individuals in the image.

 Government agencies were ordered by President [Vladimir Putin](/wiki/Vladimir_Putin "Vladimir Putin")

[\[76\]](#cite_note-Reuters_Videos_show_Ukrainian_Presence-78)

Geolocated footage confirmed that Ukrainian forces had advanced at least 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) across the Russian border, having penetrated at least two Russian defensive lines and a stronghold. Finally, on the strategic level, to slow Russia's offensive momentum, to shift the narrative and counter Russian talking points about their inevitable victory, and also to boost Ukrainian morale.[\[355\]](#cite_note-357)

Matthew Savill, director of military sciences at the [Royal United Services Institute](/wiki/Royal_United_Services_Institute "Royal United Services Institute")
 (RUSI), said that the Ukrainian incursion into Russia was "the first on this scale with conventional forces, rather than proxies \[or\] 'resistance' groups." He also assessed that [earlier raids into Kursk and Belgorod](/wiki/March_2024_western_Russia_incursion "March 2024 western Russia incursion")
 were designed to probe for Russian weak spots, and that the overall goal of the raid is to dismantle Russia's ability to funnel more troops into the [Kharkiv front](/wiki/2024_Kharkiv_offensive "2024 Kharkiv offensive")
 and that "It's unlikely that the plan is to seriously take Kursk itself, or to try and hold vast swathes of Russian territory."[\[79\]](#cite_note-Politico_August_8-81)
 BBC journalists noted the overall decrease of Russian attacks on the Ukrainian frontline at around 15–17% after the beginning of Kursk raids, which could be the sign of Russia taking forces from the frontline into Kursk Oblast.[\[356\]](#cite_note-358)

[Nico Lange](/wiki/Nico_Lange "Nico Lange")
, former chief of staff at the German [Federal Ministry of Defence](/wiki/Federal_Ministry_of_Defence_(Germany) "Federal Ministry of Defence (Germany)")
, stated that the incursion was likely "to establish a [negotiating position](/wiki/Ukraine%27s_Peace_Formula "Ukraine's Peace Formula")
 and provide relief on other front lines" and that it is unlikely that Ukrainian forces would hold territory in Kursk for long periods of time.[\[79\]](#cite_note-Politico_August_8-81)
 Retired Polish General and former commander of special forces, [Roman Polko](/wiki/Roman_Polko "Roman Polko")
, stated that "It's good that Ukraine is taking actions that surprise the Russians," and that "Ukraine is in a defensive position and is unable to conduct an operation to push Russia from the occupied regions, but Ukraine is defending itself in an active way," and that "One can't allow the Russians to comfortably prepare new attacks."[\[79\]](#cite_note-Politico_August_8-81)

Political analyst [Andreas Umland](/wiki/Andreas_Umland "Andreas Umland")
 suggested that the offensive could bring a quicker end to the war. Some officials hoped it could be the first step toward a more comprehensive peace deal.[\[306\]](#cite_note-washingtonpost-qatar-308)
 Russian foreign ministry spokesperson [Maria Zakharova](/wiki/Maria_Zakharova "Maria Zakharova")
 said that there were "no direct or indirect negotiations between Russia and Ukraine on the safety of civilian critical infrastructure facilities" and that after the assault on Kursk Oblast, Putin ruled out the possibility of such talks.[\[396\]](#cite_note-euractiv-qatar-398)
[\[397\]](#cite_note-399)
 A Russian academic with close ties to senior Russian diplomats said that Putin probably lost interest in further talks in Qatar because the "Russian leadership usually does not make any compromises under pressure" and attacks on energy infrastructure are highly effective tactics that do more damage to Ukraine than to Russia, adding that Russia is more interested in talks with Ukraine about a broader ceasefire.[\[306\]](#cite_note-washingtonpost-qatar-308)

The level of anxiety among Russians was much less than that after the [2022 mobilization](/wiki/2022_Russian_mobilization "2022 Russian mobilization")

Revealed: Russia anticipated Kursk incursion months in advance, seized papers show
==================================================================================

This article is more than 11 months old

**Exclusive:** Documents contain months of warnings about possible Ukrainian advance and also reveal concerns about morale

Russia’s military command had anticipated Ukraine’s incursion into its Kursk region and had been making plans to prevent it for several months, according to a cache of documents that the Ukrainian army said it had seized from abandoned Russian positions in the region.

The disclosure makes the disarray among Russian forces after Ukraine’s attack in early August all the more embarrassing. But Russian military documents contain months of warnings about a possible incursion into the area and an attempt to occupy Sudzha, a town of 5,000 residents that has now been [under Ukrainian occupation](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/07/ukraine-sudzha-russian-town-kursk-region)
 for more than a month.

An entry from 4 January spoke of the “potential for a breakthrough at the state border” by Ukrainian armed groups and ordered increased training to prepare to repel any attack. It recounts an incident that reportedly took place on 20 January this year, when a conscript soldier entered the summer washing area at a guard post and shot himself in the abdomen.

“The investigation into the incident determined that the cause of the suicide and death was a nervous and psychological breakdown, caused by his prolonged state of depression due to his service in the Russian army,” reads the handwritten report of the incident.

To prevent further such incidents, unit commanders are instructed to identify soldiers who “are mentally unprepared to fulfil their duties or prone to deviant behaviour, and organise their reassignment and transfer to military medical facilities”.

Further instructions on keeping up morale come in an undated, typed document that explains that soldiers should get 5-10 minutes a day as well as an hour once a week of political instruction, “aimed at maintaining and raising the political, moral and psychological condition of the personnel”.

 Russian territory. The earliest entries are dated late in 2023, while the most recent documents are from just six weeks before Ukraine launched its incursion into the Kursk region on 6 August.

The documents mostly come from units of Russia’s 488th Guards Motorised Rifle Regiment, and in particular the second company of its 17th Battalion.

Ukraine’s incursion into Kursk took Kyiv’s western partners and many in the Ukrainian elite by surprise, as planning had been restricted to a very small number of people. [Skip to main content](#maincontent)

A Ukrainian armoured personnel carrier in the Sumy region, near the border with Russia’s Kursk region, on 17 August. The June document complained that Russian units stationed at the front “are filled only 60-70% on average, and primarily made up of reserves with weak training”.

When the Ukrainian attack came on 6 August, many Russian soldiers abandoned their positions, and within a week Ukraine had taken full control of Sudzha. The documents, shared with the Guardian, also reveal Russian concerns about morale in the ranks in Kursk, which intensified after the suicide of a soldier at the front who had reportedly been in a “prolonged state of depression due to his service in the Russian army”.

Unit commanders are given instructions to ensure soldiers consume Russian state media daily to maintain their “psychological condition”.

The Guardian could not independently verify the authenticity of the documents, though they bear the hallmarks of genuine Russian army communications. The team said they had taken Russian interior ministry, FSB and army documents from buildings in the Kursk region and later provided a selection to view and photograph.

Some of the documents are printed orders distributed to various units, while others are handwritten logs recording events and concerns at specific positions."

-------------------------------

There was also increasing evidence that Moscow was having trouble stopping the Ukrainian counterinvasion in Kursk and was increasingly tapping elite units to do so.

Russian military reporters and geolocated footage have revealed that elements of the 810th and 155th naval infantry brigades, the 11th Airborne Brigade, and the 51st and 56th airborne regiments were redeployed to fight in Kursk.

The 810th and 155th naval infantry brigades had been fighting in Kharkiv, where Russia launched a new incursion in May. ![](/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AP24240624343613-1724950393.jpg?resize=770%2C513&quality=80)

Ukraine’s deep strikes against Russian military targets and its three-week-old ground offensive inside Russian territory have appeared to be yielding military and political results during the past week.

Russia was reported to be moving its aircraft back from airfields near the Ukrainian border while glide bomb attacks inside Ukraine were reported to have decreased. Sarantsev admitted that the Kursk action had had no effect on the Pokrovsk front.

An ‘insane and suicidal escapade’
---------------------------------

Western analysts have offered differing explanations for the Kursk offensive – including the diversion of Russian troops and a psychological reset through seizing the initiative. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy last week said it was a preemptive defence to prevent another Kharkiv-type invasion in the north.

But he also told Ukrainians it was “a way to compensate for the deficit in long-range capabilities”.

For months, Zelenskyy has implored the United States to allow Ukraine to use the [ATACMS long-range rocket artillery](/news/2024/8/23/which-countries-weapons-is-ukraine-using-in-russia-incursion)
 it provides to strike airfields deep inside Russia. He also wants the US to release Britain and France, for whose Storm Shadow missiles the US provides components, to authorise their use in the same way.

Currently, the US allows Ukraine to use its weapons to counter battery fire within a limited range across the border but not to hit Russian airfields because it is afraid that this could draw the US into the war.

![INTERACTIVE-WHO CONTROLS WHAT IN SOUTHERN UKRAINE-1724833604](/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/INTERACTIVE-WHO-CONTROLS-WHAT-IN-SOUTHERN-UKRAINE-1724833604.png?w=770&resize=770%2C770&quality=80)

(Al Jazeera)

In a recent analysis, the ISW identified that “at least 209 of 245 (more than 85 percent) known Russian military objects in range of ATACMS are not air bases” but ammunition depots, communications centres, army bases and command centres.

White House national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters on Monday that restrictions on the use of long-range weapons remain in place but “we’ll keep the conversations with the Ukrainians going” to potentially revise them.

The European Commission, which does not command military assets, has openly supported a lifting of restrictions.

The European Union’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, [repeated that support](/news/2024/8/29/eus-borrell-urges-ukraine-backers-to-lift-curbs-on-arms-use-inside-russia)
 on Monday and Thursday. “I reiterate that lifting restrictions on the use of capabilities against the Russian military involved in aggression against Ukraine, in accordance with international law, would strengthen Ukrainian self-defence, save lives and reduce destruction in Ukraine,” he said on Monday.

Russian officials bared their teeth against any such decision and hit out against the fact that both Brussels and Washington have allowed the use of US and European equipment in Ukraine’s Kursk offensive.

“The West does not want to avoid escalation. Life has the same value everywhere.”

Zelenskyy said he had discussed such a joint aerial defence with Lithuanian Prime Minister Ingrid Shimonite and Polish President Andrej Duda in Kyiv on August 24.

Taking the fight to Russia
--------------------------

While Ukraine seeks expanded authority and cooperation from its allies, it is also going its own way. It is believed prototypes of this missile may have been used against Russian-occupied Crimea in August 2023 to [destroy two S-400](/news/2024/2/12/for-ukraines-defence-industry-ambitions-the-skys-the-limit)
 air defence systems. Evidence that Moscow was scrambling elite units from Ukraine to defend home turf also mounted during the week.

An unnamed White House official told the Politico news website that “90 percent of the planes that launch glide bombs” against Ukrainian front-line positions had been moved back inside Russia.

![INTERACTIVE-ATTACK_ON_KURSK_AUG_28-1724833592](/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/INTERACTIVE-ATTACK_ON_KURSK_AUG_20-1724833592.png?w=770&resize=770%2C962&quality=80)

(Al Jazeera)

The independent analysis website Frontelligence agreed that “between the second half of June and mid-July, Russian forces relocated many valuable assets away from the Ukrainian border,” including planes and helicopters.

Ukrainian Colonel Vitaly Sarantsev told a joint news telethon broadcast by Ukrainian channels that the Kursk offensive had greatly reduced Russia’s use of aviation against northeastern Ukraine.

“We felt relief in tactical aviation,” he said on Sunday. Ukrainian Commander-in-Chief [Oleksandr Syrskii](/news/2024/2/13/who-is-ukraine-armys-new-commander-in-chief-and-what-challenges-does-he-fa)
 estimated it was in the region of 30,000."

*   Russian Foreign Ministry summons US Charge d'affaires in Moscow Stephanie Holmes to convey strong protest against 'provocative actions of American reporters' and 'participation of the American PMCs'   

**MOSCOW** 

Russia protested on Tuesday that US private military companies (PMCs) are fighting alongside Ukraine in the Kursk region, while reporters from several major American media outlets illegally entered Russian territory to cover the incursion. 

The Russian Foreign Ministry claimed in a statement that soldiers from US private military companies are fighting alongside Ukrainian troops in the Kursk region, and journalists illegally entered Russian territory to cover the incursion.

US Charge d'affaires Stephanie Holmes was summoned to the Foreign Ministry in Moscow to convey strong protest against the "provocative actions of American reporters" and "participation of the American PMCs on the side of Ukraine's armed forces during their invasion" of Russia, it said.

"Such actions are contradicting statements by Joe Biden administration about non-involvement in Ukraine's neo-Nazi attack against Russia, proving with all clarity US involvement as a direct participant of the conflict in (Ukraine's President Volodymyr) Zelenskyy's malicious intentions," the ministry stressed.

The ministry warned that Russian law enforcement will investigate US citizens’ actions and take necessary measures to bring them to justice.

"All foreign 'specialists' and mercenaries illegally crossing the border of our country automatically become a legitimate military target for the armed forces of the Russian Federation," it said.

Kyiv's incursion into the Kursk region began on the night of August 5-6, when Ukrainian forces entered near Sudzha. **Please contact us for subscription options.**](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/p/subscription/1001)

A recent photo confirms that Forward Observation Group, a private military firm under contract with Ukraine, is active in Kursk.

The Russian Foreign Ministry said that the participation of the American PMCs on the side of the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the invasion of the Kursk region proves the involvement of the United States as a [direct party to the conflict](https://eadaily.com/en/news/2024/08/22/mercenaries-from-the-forward-observation-group-pmcs-were-destroyed-in-the-kursk-region-video)
, and mercenaries automatically become a legitimate military target. Then, things changed.

Ukraine’s Kursk offensive is the latest phase in this war and marks the first time fighting has occurred on Russian soil. Alternatively, Russia could continue operations in the Donbas and pay the domestic price of ignoring the Ukrainian incursion and effectively ceding parts of Kursk and Belgorod to Ukraine. Russia is now forced to fly longer distances in attempts to stop Ukraine in Kursk. To avoid a fair fight with an experienced lawyer, most insurance companies settle DBA claims on victim-friendly terms prior to this hearing.

  American Private Military Contractors Are in Kursk - Barnett, Lerner, Karsen, Frankel & Castro, P.A. The Foreign Ministry stressed that in relation to the American citizens involved, in accordance with the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, the necessary investigative actions will be carried out to bring them to justice.

The Russian press accused FOG contractors of targeting civilians during the fighting. “With all due respect to the leadership of the Security Service of Ukraine, all questions should be addressed to them. We have no comments,” the company said in response.

#### **Russo-Ukraine War: The Latest**

In the spring of 2024, the latest Russia-Ukraine War seemed to be heading toward a stalemate. Beginning with the 2022 invasion, Russia poured everything it had into the Ukraine war. Prior to the Kursk incursion, Russia was taking roughly 1,000 casualties a day, with corresponding equipment losses."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The web search results confirm the occurrence of a Ukrainian incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024, as reported by Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kursk_campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kursk_campaign)), The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/20/revealed-russia-anticipated-kursk-incursion-months-in-advance-seized-papers-show](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/20/revealed-russia-anticipated-kursk-incursion-months-in-advance-seized-papers-show)) and Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2024/8/29/russia-lashes-out-against-terrorist-incursion-in-kursk-pulls-back-planes](https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2024/8/29/russia-lashes-out-against-terrorist-incursion-in-kursk-pulls-back-planes)). The Guardian article includes a photograph of a Ukrainian armoured personnel carrier near the border. The Al Jazeera article mentions the redeployment of Russian forces. The Wikipedia article does not mention the image <image:24>

### Evidence from `web_search`
According to Anadolu Agency, Russia protested the involvement of US mercenaries fighting alongside Ukraine in the Kursk region, with the incursion beginning on the night of August 5-6, 2024. ([https://www.aa.com.tr/en/russia-ukraine-war/russia-formally-protests-us-mercenaries-joining-ukrainian-soldiers-in-kursk-region-/3308755](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/russia-ukraine-war/russia-formally-protests-us-mercenaries-joining-ukrainian-soldiers-in-kursk-region-/3308755)) <image:k>

Injuredoverseas.com discusses the presence of American Private Military Contractors (PMCs) from the Forward Observation Group (FOG) in the Kursk region of Russia, with the Russian Foreign Ministry stating that this proves the involvement of the United States as a direct party to the conflict. ([https://www.injuredoverseas.com/?p=11300](https://www.injuredoverseas.com/?p=11300)) <image:5995> The Kursk incursion happened in the spring of 2024. The Ukrainian Photographers website published news stories on January 19, 21, and 23, 2025.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that a Ukrainian incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast occurred in August 2024. Furthermore, there are reports of US mercenaries participating in the incursion. The image shows individuals with American flags on their uniforms.

Based on the evidence, the claim is likely true. However, the evidence does not directly link the image to the Kursk incursion. More information is needed to confirm that the individuals in the image are the same as those mentioned in the reports.

Based on the evidence, the claim is likely true. Reports confirm a Ukrainian incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024, with reports of US mercenaries participating. The image shows individuals with American flag patches on their uniforms, which aligns with the claim, although a direct link between the image and the incursion is not explicitly established.
