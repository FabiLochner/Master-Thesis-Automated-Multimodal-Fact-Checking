Yahoo News states that the photo of Zelenskyy and Schwab in suits was taken in January 2020, before the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Since the invasion, Zelenskyy has stopped wearing suits publicly.

## Elaboration
The image shows Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Klaus Schwab at the World Economic Forum. The evidence indicates that the photo was taken in January 2020, before the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Since the invasion, Zelenskyy has stopped wearing suits publicly.


## Final Judgement
The claim is misleading because the image was taken before the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The claim implies that the photo was taken after the invasion, which is not accurate. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image depicts Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Klaus Schwab at the World Economic Forum, but the photo was taken in January 2020, before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, as reported by [Yahoo News](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/photo-zelenskyy-wearing-suit-meeting-171653150.html).
