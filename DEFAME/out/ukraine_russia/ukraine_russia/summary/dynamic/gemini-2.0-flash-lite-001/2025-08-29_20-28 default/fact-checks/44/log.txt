Content: The article from Le Monde reports on remarks made by US President Joe Biden on September 30, 2024, regarding the response to Hurricane Helene. <image:2167> Biden announced he would travel to North Carolina to monitor rescue efforts. The article mentions the death toll from the storm and the criticism from Donald Trump.

The claim 'In remarks to reporters on September 29, 2024 US President Joe Biden announced that no more aid would be provided for the areas affected by Hurrican Helene, but 2.4 billion US-$ more for Ukraine.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. Fact-checks from sources like [Yahoo News](https://www.yahoo.com/news/no-biden-didnt-hes-done-153402427.html) and [Le Monde](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/united-states/article/2024/09/30/biden-pledges-to-aid-victims-of-hurrican-helene-as-long-as-it-takes_6727795_133.html) indicate that Biden did not make the statement in question and, in fact, pledged aid to Hurricane Helene victims.

So, the overall veracity is: false
