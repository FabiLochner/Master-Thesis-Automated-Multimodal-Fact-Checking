From [Source](https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-ap-top-news-ca-state-wire-adam-schiff-politics-3eec3ea9be5c07a9c297bad439f8f3e8): 
Content: The Associated Press published an article about Adam Schiff, mentioning his role in the impeachment trial against Donald Trump. <image:i>. The article states that Schiff has been a frequent target of conservatives since the then GOP-led House Intelligence Committee started investigating Trumpâ€™s ties to Russia in the 2016 election.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Adam Schiff was assigned to various committees. However, the provided sources do not explicitly state that John Thune blocked any of Schiff's committee assignments. The AP article mentions Schiff's involvement in the Russia investigation and his subsequent targeting by conservatives.

To verify the claim, information is missing regarding whether John Thune, in his capacity as Majority Leader, took any action to block Schiff's committee assignments.
