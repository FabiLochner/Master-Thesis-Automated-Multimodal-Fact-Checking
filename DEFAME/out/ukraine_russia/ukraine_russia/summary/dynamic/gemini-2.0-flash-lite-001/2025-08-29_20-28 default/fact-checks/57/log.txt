Useful result: From [Source](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/donald-trump-keir-starmer-ukraine-tirade-b2708208.html): 
Content: The Independent reports that Donald Trump criticized European leaders, including Keir Starmer, regarding their talks over Ukraine. The article mentions Trump's criticism of Volodymyr Zelensky and his decision to halt military aid to Ukraine.

The claim 'In an interview with podcaster Theo Von in August 2024, Donald Trump criticized British Prime Minister Keir Starmer over a 100-year deal between the U.K. and Ukraine.' is false.
Justification: The claim is partially supported. While Donald Trump did criticize Keir Starmer regarding Ukraine, as reported by The Independent ([https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/donald-trump-keir-starmer-ukraine-tirade-b2708208.html](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/donald-trump-keir-starmer-ukraine-tirade-b2708208.html)), the evidence does not confirm that the criticism was specifically about a 100-year deal between the U.K. and Ukraine, nor does it confirm that the interview took place in August 2024.

So, the overall veracity is: false
