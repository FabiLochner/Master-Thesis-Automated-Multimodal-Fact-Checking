## Elaboration
The Tasnim News Agency article mentions Russia's comments on the California wildfires, but it does not explicitly state that Russia offered assistance. The article does mention reports of prisoners being mobilized to extinguish fires.

Other sources, such as the German Marshall Fund of the United States and NPR, discuss how Russian state-affiliated accounts used the wildfires to spread false narratives, but they do not mention any offers of assistance.

Based on the provided evidence, there is no information to verify that Russia offered assistance for the California wildfires.


## Final Judgement

Furthermore, articles from the German Marshall Fund of the United States ([Source](https://www.gmfus.org/news/inflaming-divides-russian-narratives-california-wildfires)) and NPR ([Source](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/16/nx-s1-5259842/los-angeles-california-fires-russia-ukraine)) discuss how Russian state-affiliated accounts used the wildfires to spread false narratives, but they do not mention any offers of assistance.
