## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
In October 2024, the IMF published the World Economic Outlook, discussing global growth and structural reforms (![image 4533](media/2025-08-23_11-53-1755950009-342605.jpg)). The IMF held a meeting on October 24-25, 2024, in Washington, D.C. According to the statement by the Minister of Finance of the Russian Federation, Anton Siluanov, the Russian economy "continues to show consistently high growth rates, systematically surpassing most forecasts, including those of the IMF."

The Moscow Times reported on October 22, 2024, that the IMF boosted its 2024 growth forecast for Russia (![image 4535](media/2025-08-23_11-54-1755950056-339449.jpg)). The IMF expects the Russian economy to expand by 3.6% in 2024.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the IMF published the World Economic Outlook in October 2024, which discussed the Russian economy. The Moscow Times reported that the IMF boosted its 2024 growth forecast for Russia. However, the provided evidence does not explicitly state that the IMF declared Russia the fourth-largest economy in the world.

To verify the claim, information about the IMF's ranking of the Russian economy in October 2024 is missing.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://www.russiamatters.org/blog/russias-economy-collapsing): 
Content: The IMF ranks Russia as the worldâ€™s 4th largest economy in terms of PPP. The article is from February 6, 2025. <image:AP24325279743092>


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the IMF ranked Russia as the world's 4th largest economy in terms of PPP. However, the provided source is from February 6, 2025, which is after the date specified in the claim.

The claim is therefore not entirely verifiable based on the provided evidence, as the ranking is from a later date.


## Final Judgement
The IMF did rank Russia as the fourth-largest economy in the world in terms of PPP, but the provided source is from February 2025, not October 2024. The evidence does not confirm the claim for October 2024.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The IMF did rank Russia as the fourth-largest economy in the world in terms of PPP, according to a source from February 2025 ([https://www.russiamatters.org/blog/russias-economy-collapsing](https://www.russiamatters.org/blog/russias-economy-collapsing)). However, the claim specifies October 2024, and the provided evidence does not confirm the ranking for that specific date.
