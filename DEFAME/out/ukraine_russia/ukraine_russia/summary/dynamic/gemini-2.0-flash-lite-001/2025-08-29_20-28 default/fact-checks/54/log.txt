Useful result: From [Source](https://cbsaustin.com/news/nation-world/exploring-impact-accountability-us-military-aid-to-ukraine-war-russia-congressional-budget-funding-money-weapons-refugees-tracking-territory-report): 
Content: The CBS Austin article, published on September 25, 2024, discusses U.S. military aid to Ukraine. It mentions that the Biden Administration is planning to send $5.9 billion worth of weapons and equipment to Ukraine. The U.S. has provided Ukraine with more than $107 billion in military assistance since 2022. A report from the Office of the Inspector General found that at least one billion dollars worth of weapons sent to Ukraine wasnâ€™t properly tracked. <image:5981>, <image:5981>, <image:5981>, <image:5981>.

Useful result: From [Source](https://internationalpolicy.org/publications/maintaining-transparency-in-us-security-assistance-to-ukraine/): 
Content: The International Policy Journal discusses US security assistance to Ukraine, mentioning the US has sent a massive amount of aid to bolster Ukraine's military since the Russian invasion. <image:5982> The article also mentions that the US government has been more transparent about security assistance to Ukraine than arms shipments to other countries. The Government Accountability Office found that the State Department and the Pentagon have not always communicated on how to properly ensure that end-use monitoring is being implemented.

The claim 'Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States' is false.
Justification: The claim is not supported by the evidence. While the US has provided significant military aid to Ukraine, and there have been issues with tracking some equipment, there is no evidence to suggest that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. Sources like [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/28/politics/trump-missile-sale-ukraine) and [forumarmstrade.org](https://www.forumarmstrade.org/ukrainearms.html) detail aid packages and sales but do not mention Ukraine selling armaments.

So, the overall veracity is: false
