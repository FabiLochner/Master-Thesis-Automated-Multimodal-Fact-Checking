## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The claim that Benjamin Netanyahu announced plans to resettle Palestinians in Gaza to Ukraine and Syria during his visit to the White House in April 2025 is false, according to [StopFake.org](https://www.stopfake.org/en/fake-israeli-prime-minister-netanyahu-proposed-to-resettle-gaza-residents-to-ukraine-and-syria/). The article, published on August 7, 2025, states that the claim originated from a Facebook post with an image of Netanyahu and Donald Trump (![image 2170](media/2025-08-07_20-04-1754597094-615062.jpg)).

[The Soufan Center](https://thesoufancenter.org/intelbrief-2025-april-9/) published an Intelbrief on April 9, 2025, discussing Netanyahu's visit to the White House and tensions between Israel and Turkey over Syria (![image 2171](media/2025-08-07_20-04-1754597099-839739.jpg)). [The Jerusalem Post](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-863006) published an article on August 2, 2025, about a bilateral dinner between Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House on July 7, 2025 (![image 1](media/0.jpg)).


## Elaboration
The claim is false. StopFake.org explicitly states that the claim is false and originated from a Facebook post. The Soufan Center's Intelbrief from April 9, 2025, discusses Netanyahu's visit to the White House, but it does not mention any resettlement plans. The Jerusalem Post article from August 2, 2025, discusses a dinner between Trump and Netanyahu, but it does not mention any resettlement plans either.


## Final Judgement
The claim is demonstrably false. The provided evidence from StopFake.org directly refutes the claim, stating it originated from a Facebook post and is false. Other sources discuss Netanyahu's visit to the White House but do not mention any resettlement plans.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. According to [StopFake.org](https://www.stopfake.org/en/fake-israeli-prime-minister-netanyahu-proposed-to-resettle-gaza-residents-to-ukraine-and-syria/), the claim originated from a Facebook post and is demonstrably false. Other sources, such as The Soufan Center and The Jerusalem Post, discuss Netanyahu's visit to the White House but do not mention any resettlement plans.
