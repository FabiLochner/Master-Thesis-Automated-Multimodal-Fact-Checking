Reuters published an article on March 3, 2025, stating that Wałęsa expressed "horror" at Trump's argument with Zelenskyy. ![image 1962](media/2025-08-07_19-24-1754594684-890174.jpg) The Los Angeles Times also reported on March 3, 2025, that Wałęsa and other former political prisoners wrote a letter to Trump criticizing his behavior toward Zelenskyy. <image:i>


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Lech Wałęsa wrote a letter to Donald Trump in March 2025. The letter criticized Trump's treatment of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The evidence does not explicitly mention the suspension of U.S. military aid to Ukraine, but it does state that Wałęsa's letter condemned Trump's actions.

The evidence suggests that Wałęsa's criticism was related to Trump's behavior towards Zelenskyy, and not necessarily the suspension of military aid. Further information would be needed to confirm if the letter specifically addressed the suspension of aid.
