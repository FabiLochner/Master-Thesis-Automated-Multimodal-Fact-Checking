### Evidence from `web_search`
The BBC News article from November 12, 2024, discusses the Ukrainian incursion into Russia's Kursk region, with Volodymyr Zelensky stating the operation is holding down 50,000 Russian troops. The article mentions a New York Times report suggesting Russia has amassed troops in Kursk, including North Korean soldiers, for a counter-offensive. ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9vn1x23x88o](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9vn1x23x88o)) ![image 3083](media/2025-08-22_08-56-1755852963-192316.jpg), ![image 3082](media/2025-08-22_08-56-1755852962-883849.jpg)

The Moscow Times reports on the ongoing conflict in the Kursk region, mentioning a shock offensive launched by Kyiv in August 2024, and Zelensky's statement that Ukraine's army was still fighting in Russia's Kursk.

The article mentions a new Ukrainian offensive in the region, with fighting reported near Sudzha, which Ukraine captured in August.

## Elaboration
The claim is partially verifiable. The image (![image 7](media/9.jpg)

## Final Judgement
The image in the claim shows Volodymyr Zelensky, but it was taken in May 2022 in the Kharkiv region, not in August 2024 in the Kursk region. While there are reports of a Ukrainian offensive in the Kursk region in August 2024, the image is misrepresented.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image in the claim, which shows Volodymyr Zelensky, was taken in May 2022 in the Kharkiv region, not in August 2024 in the Kursk region as the claim states. While there are reports of a Ukrainian offensive in the Kursk region in August 2024, the image is misrepresented.
