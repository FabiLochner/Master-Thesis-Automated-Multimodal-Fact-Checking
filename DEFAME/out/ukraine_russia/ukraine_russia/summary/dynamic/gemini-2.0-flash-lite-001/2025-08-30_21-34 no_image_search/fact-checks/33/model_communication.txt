**ISTANBUL**

Ukraine on Sunday called for an apology and an investigation from Fox News over its broadcast on Easter, during which it labeled the country’s capital Kyiv a “Russian city.”

Multiple Ukrainian media outlets, including RBC-Ukraine news agency, reported that Fox News aired footage of Easter services taking place across the globe, including a service in Moscow attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The New York-based television channel also shared footage of services taking place in the Ukrainian capital, which initially labeled the events as taking place in “Kyiv, Ukraine.”

However, the on-screen text later changed to “Kyiv, Russia,” that was reportedly shown for about 20 minutes before it was corrected.

“If this was a mistake rather than a deliberate political statement, there should be an apology and an investigation into who made the mistake,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Heorhii Tykhyi said on X.

In a statement on X, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked the media for "sharing the truth about what is happening" amid the Easter ceasefire declared by Putin a day earlier.

“Instead of broadcasting religious service from Moscow, the focus should be on pressuring Moscow to genuinely commit to a full ceasefire and to maintain it for at least 30 days after Easter – to give diplomacy a real chance,” Zelenskyy added.

On Saturday, Putin declared a 30-hour unilateral ceasefire in the ongoing war in Ukraine, arguing that the halt’s success or failure would show Kyiv’s readiness and capacity to seek a peaceful resolution to the conflict.

In response, Zelenskyy said that his country would be mirroring Russia’s actions, expressing that Kyiv proposes extending the halt for 30 days beyond Orthodox Easter “if a complete ceasefire truly takes hold.”

The ceasefire began at 6:00 pm Moscow time and will continue until Monday midnight, though both Moscow and Kyiv have since accused each other of violating it.

A [Fox](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/fox)
 TV station has been accused of labeling the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, as Russian territory during an Easter broadcast, prompting Ukraine's Foreign Ministry to call for an investigation "if this was a mistake rather than a deliberate political statement."

Why It Matters
--------------

Moscow has attempted to paint the government in Kyiv as illegitimate, and President [Vladimir Putin](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/vladimir-putin)
 penned an extensive essay back in 2021 that called Russia and Ukraine "one people."

Moscow has labeled territory annexed from Ukraine as Russian, and suggested these areas fall under the country's nuclear umbrella.

The Kremlin seized control of Crimea, the peninsula to the south of mainland Ukraine, from Kyiv in 2014. Languages: English, Spanish.You can reach Ellie via email at [e.cook@newsweek.com](mailto:e.cook@newsweek.com)

The announcement [was quickly met with skepticism from Kyiv officials](https://www.newsweek.com/vladimir-putin-easter-truce-russia-ukraine-backlash-2061857)
 and Western analysts.

Ukraine said Russian strikes and assaults along the front lines have continued despite the announcement. Moscow in turn accused Kyiv of violating the ceasefire.

"As of Easter morning, we can state that the Russian army is attempting to create the general impression of a ceasefire, while in some areas still continuing isolated attempts to advance and inflict losses on Ukraine," Ukrainian President [Volodymyr Zelensky](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/volodymyr-zelensky)
 said in a statement early on Sunday.

The declared truce came a day after Secretary of State [Marco Rubio](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/marco-rubio)
 said Washington could be evaluating in the next few days whether U.S. Russian state media on Sunday referred to Ukraine's southern Zaporizhzhia region as "Novorossiya."

Kremlin spokesperson, [Dmitry Peskov](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/dmitry-peskov)
, said in October 2022 that these Ukrainian regions were "inalienable parts of the Russian Federation."

"Live Now made an unintentional mistake Saturday evening during extensive live coverage of Easter services from around the world," a spokesperson said in response to a _Newsweek_ comment request. We regret and apologize for the mistake."

Easter is the main holiday for Orthodox Christians, although many in Ukraine now mark major holidays like Christmas in line with Western celebrations to distance themselves religious services from Moscow. Patriarch Kirill, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, has endorsed the invasion of Ukraine.

Putin attended an Easter service at Moscow's Cathedral of Christ the Savior, conducted by Patriarch Kirill, late on Saturday.

The Kremlin leader declared on Saturday that Moscow would halt "all military operations" for 30 hours between 6 p.m. teams would be able to [clinch a ceasefire deal in the next few weeks.](https://www.newsweek.com/ukraine-ceasefire-marco-rubio-russia-putin-zelensky-steve-witkoff-2061408)

"We're not going to continue to fly all over the world and do meeting after meeting after meeting if no progress is being made," Rubio said.

Kyiv, under intense pressure from Washington, has already agreed to a U.S.-proposed ceasefire deal. [](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=)

В **Міністерстві закордонних справ України** заявили, що телеканал має попросити вибачення за свою помилку та провести розслідування.

Oroszország neve szerepelt Kijevé mellett az amerikai Fox News csatorna adásában, amelyben a különböző országok húsvéti ünnepségeit mutatták be, [írja](https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2025/04/20/7508362/)
 az Ukrajinszka Pravda. Többek között az orosz ortodox egyház ceremóniáját is bemutatták, amelyen Vlagyimir Putyin elnök is részt vett, majd nem sokkal később az ukránoké következett.

„Kijev, Ukrajna” – állt a felirat felvétel mellett, majd Ukrajnát egyszer csak kicserélték Oroszországra, amit aztán hosszabb ideig mutattak a képernyőn. Végül azért visszacsatolták Ukrajna fővárosát Ukrajnához.

Mindez jelentős felháborodást keltett az orosz agresszió áldozatául esett ország nyilvánosságában.

Fox news

Američka televizijska mreža **Fox News**, poznata po svojoj **pro-republikanskoj orijentaciji**, izazvala je val kritika i ogorčenja nakon što je na Uskrs emitirala **višeminutni prijenos pravoslavne mise** iz Rusije, na kojoj su prikazani **Vladimir Putin** i **patrijarh Kiril Gundjajev**. Tijekom više od **30 minuta emitiranja**, voditelji su Kijev nazvali “**ruskim gradom**“, što je izazvalo val negativnih reakcija u **Ukrajini**, ali i u **Sjedinjenim Američkim Državama**.

* * *

### **Kritike: “Legitimiziranje zločinaca” i “pranje imidža”**

Emitiranje mise s Putinom u prvom planu i patrijarhom Kirilom, koji je **otvoreno podržavao rusku agresiju na Ukrajinu**, mnogi su gledatelji i analitičari okarakterizirali kao **“legitimizaciju ubojica”**. Na društvenim mrežama zaredale su optužbe da **Fox News pokušava prikazati Putina kao uzornog kršćanina**, unatoč njegovim **neispunjenim obećanjima o uskrsnom primirju**, dok se u isto vrijeme nastavljaju **ruski napadi na ukrajinske gradove**.

* * *

### **Dvostruka mjerila i politička poruka?**

Komentatori su upozorili na **hipokriziju u pristupu**, budući da je televizijska kuća odlučila prikazivati **vjerski događaj** u režiji autokratskog režima, istovremeno **zanemarujući agresiju**, **civilne žrtve** i **ratna razaranja** koje taj isti režim provodi. Posebno je problematična izjava voditelja koji je **Kijev, [glavni grad](https://www.rijekadanas.com/pesut-na-skupstini-liste-za-rijeku-nas-glavni-grad-je-rijeka/)
 Ukrajine, nazvao ruskim gradom** – što je stav u potpunosti suprotan međunarodnom pravu i stajalištima većine zapadnih zemalja.

* * *

### **Reakcije iz Ukrajine**

Ukrajinski korisnici društvenih mreža, novinari i diplomati izrazili su **ogorčenje zbog emitiranja sadržaja koji potiče rusku propagandu**. Mnogi su podsjetili da patrijarh Kiril od početka rata **otvoreno blagoslivlja vojne operacije**, a da sam **Putin koristi vjerske događaje** kako bi prikrio političke i vojne ciljeve.

A screenshot from the Russia 1 segment showing explicit photos of Melania Trump (X/Julia Davis)

"In one of the shots, the model is only wearing her underwear, lying on a blue carpet with the United States seal, as though the editors of the men's magazine knew something in advance about the future of their model," he added with a smirk.

Beside him, Skabeeva can be seen visibly trying to suppress laughter.

Since Russian President Vladimir Putin suppressed freedom of speech in the country in the early 2000s and placed a tight grip on all mainstream TV networks, with little has been allowed to be aired in Russia without the government's permission.

The German government has confirmed the release of 15 people “unjustly imprisoned in [Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia)
,” Reuters reported.

**Who is Alsu Kurmasheva?**

Kurmasheva, one of the prisoner freed as part of the exchange, is a Russian-American journalist for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.

A Russian court sentenced the 47-year old in July to six-and-a-half years in prison after a rushed, secret trial.

Kurmasheva, who has two children, was arrested last year during a family visit to the city of Kazan for failing to register as a “foreign agent” and for spreading “false information” about the country’s armed forces.

Stephen Capus, the RFE/RL president and CEO, had denounced her trial and conviction as “a mockery of justice”.

!Alsu Kurmasheva listens to her lawyer during a court hearing in Kazan, Russia on Friday, May 31. “This operation has been recorded in history as the most extensive prisoner exchange between the United States, Russia, and Germany in recent years.”

From what we can see, the exchange is still in process, and hasn’t officially ended until all of the planes have left the tarmac in Ankara.

As part of the exchange, Germany has released a Russian assassin, **[Vadim Krasikov](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/26/vadim-krasikov-who-russian-hitman-navalny-prisoner-swap-claim#:~:text=Explainer-,Vadim%20Krasikov%3A%20who%20is%20Russian%20hitman,to%20Navalny%20prisoner%20swap%20claim%3F&text=Allies%20of%20the%20late%20Russian,convicted%20hitman%20jailed%20in%20Germany.)
**, according to a Turkish presidency statement.

A high-ranking colonel in the Russian secret service FSB, the 58-year old was serving a life sentence in a German jail for [the 2019 murder](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/28/russia-denies-ordering-assassination-of-zelimkhan-khangoshvili-chechen-exile-in-berlin)
 of **Zelimkhan Khangoshvili**, a Georgian-born Chechen dissident, in Berlin’s central Tiergarten park.

Vladimir Putin had made it clear that securing Krasikov’s return to [Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia)
 was his No 1 target.

The Russian leader [alluded](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/09/putin-says-release-of-us-journalist-evan-gershkovich-may-be-possible)
 to him in February, saying the release of the US journalist **Evan Gershkovich** could be secured in a prison swap involving a man, whom he described as a “patriot” serving a life sentence in a “US allied country” after being convicted of “liquidating a bandit”.

Alex Jones Reporter Jamie White Murdered | Ukraine Hit List Connection?
=======================================================================

[! As new reports emerge, it appears White may have been listed on a Ukrainian NGO hit list, raising serious questions about whether his death was a targeted assassination or a tragic coincidence in a city plagued by rising crime. Could this be another example of politically motivated violence, or is it yet another failure under Soros-backed District Attorney Jose Garza, whose policies have been widely criticized for enabling lawlessness in Austin?"

Following White’s death, Jones wrote on X, “we pledge that Jamie’s tragic death will not be in vain, and those responsible for this senseless violence will be brought to justice.”

White’s sister, Kelly Kneale, told [The Independent](http://canva.com/design/DAGgsqGrM1Q/AC7eQMREsN7H1eB8Rox32w/edit)
 that she does not think the hit was planned.

“I don’t believe it was targeted… he was shot by a person or persons trying to break into his car for the second time,” she said.

News of White’s death first came to light on Monday afternoon when Jones announced it live on air, saying, “There are a lot of really cool people who have worked at Infowars over the years and one of the most amazing people was Jamie White…. Jamie was murdered last night outside of his home.”

Jones blamed Democrats for White’s death, arguing they have failed to control crime both locally and across the country.

He went on to commend police for their quick response and informed viewers that Infowars staff had been sent home to grieve.

[Alex Jones](https://www.latintimes.com/search/site?q=Alex+Jones)
 and his supporters are now alleging that an Infowars reporter who was killed outside of his home in Austin, [Texas](https://www.latintimes.com/search/site/Texas)
, was murdered by [Ukrainian](https://www.latintimes.com/search/site/Ukraine)
 forces in a targeted hit, giving rise to yet another conspiracy theory that officials have cast doubt upon.

Infowars reporter Jamie White, 36, was found lying on the ground in a parking lot outside of his apartment complex with gunshot wounds, according to Austin police. Detectives believe the suspects were possibly burglarizing White's vehicle, when he interrupted them," said the police statement.

Jones, Infowars' founder, said the killing "could've been a hit" while being interviewed by conservative commentator Benny Johnson.

"What are the chances in a town of over two million people that an Infowars lead reporter gets butchered?" Jones inquired, despite Austin having a population of less than one million residents.

He continued to allege that White was on a Ukrainian hit list alongside other prominent figures such as billionaire Tesla CEO Elon Musk, and that he had asked the Justice Department to protect him.

"I think Pam Bondi should look into it," Mr. White allegedly confronted suspects attempting to break into his vehicle in the parking lot, upon which they shot him and fled the scene, stated Austin police Detective Jason Jones at a Wednesday press conference.

"Homicide Detectives and Crime Scene Specialists responded to process the scene and interview witnesses. They said they can't really respond to most crime scenes."

White's social media accounts indicate that he himself believed he was on a Ukrainian hit list.

"I'm on the Ukrainian 'Enemies List' due to my work at Infowars and with Alex Jones on the Ukraine proxy war The group who compiled this list is tied to the U.S. The initial investigation shows that White was shot and killed in the parking lot of the apartment complex in which he lived. "The Austin Police Department admitted they're totally overwhelmed."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim that Jamie White was on a Ukrainian enemies hit list is not definitively supported by the evidence. While multiple sources confirm that Jamie White, an InfoWars writer, was shot dead in Austin, Texas, on March 10, 2025, the evidence presents conflicting information regarding the hit list.

Some sources, such as ABC News and Global News, do not mention any connection to a Ukrainian hit list. However, The Investigate Earth Conspiracy Podcast and The Latin Times report that White may have been on a Ukrainian hit list, with the latter stating that Alex Jones and his supporters allege this.

Therefore, the claim's veracity is uncertain, as it relies on allegations and conspiracy theories. More information is needed to verify the claim.

ABC News ([Source](https://abcnews.go.com/US/infowars-reporter-shot-dead-apartment-after-possibly-interrupting/story?id=119677965)) reports that Jamie White was shot dead on March 9, 2025, in Austin, Texas, after interrupting burglars. <image:9075> The article does not mention any connection to a Ukrainian hit list. 6abc.com ([Source](https://6abc.com/post/jamie-white-infowars-reporter-shot-dead-outside-apartment/16007913/)) also reports on the death of Jamie White. <image:9085>, <image:9084>

## Elaboration
The claim that Jamie White was on a Ukrainian enemies hit list is not definitively supported by the evidence. While multiple sources confirm that Jamie White, an InfoWars writer, was shot dead in Austin, Texas, on March 10, 2025, the evidence presents conflicting information regarding the hit list.

Some sources, such as ABC News and Global News, do not mention any connection to a Ukrainian hit list. However, The Investigate Earth Conspiracy Podcast and The Latin Times report that White may have been on a Ukrainian hit list, with the latter stating that Alex Jones and his supporters allege this.

Therefore, the claim's veracity is uncertain, as it relies on allegations and conspiracy theories. More information is needed to verify the claim.

Police said in a statement Tuesday that Jamie White, 36, was found lying on the ground in the parking lot of the apartment complex where he lived, with trauma to his body. White's most recent article was published a day before his death.

"We pledge that Jamie’s tragic death will not be in vain, and those responsible for this senseless violence will be brought to justice," Jones said in a statement that blamed White's death "in part" on the policies of Travis County District Attorney José Garza, a Democrat.

Garza dismissed Jones' claim in a statement provided to the American-Statesman.

"Our hearts go out to the family of Jamie White," Garza said. Monday, the department said.

"The initial investigation shows that White was shot and killed in the parking lot of the apartment complex in which he lived," the statement said. White and supporting the Austin Police Department in its investigation."

In a statement released on social media Monday evening, Jones said White had been a "reporter" for the far-right site. "It is shameful, but not surprising, that Alex Jones is trying to exploit the victims’ death for political gain. Briscoe Cain, a Republican from Deer Park, also blamed Garza in a post on X that claimed that "Austin is becoming more unsafe because of the policies of progressive Democrats."

In 2022, Jones was found guilty of defamation by juries in Texas and Connecticut after he repeatedly claimed that the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting, which killed 20 children and six adults, was a hoax and that the families of the victims were "paid crisis actors."

He was ordered to pay $1.4 billion in damages and later filed for bankruptcy.

Late last year, the satirical news source the Onion, along with the Sandy Hook families who Jones defamed, successfully bid on InfoWars to cover the damages."

## Elaboration
The claim that Jamie White was on a Ukrainian enemies hit list is not definitively supported by the evidence. While multiple sources confirm that Jamie White, an InfoWars writer, was shot dead in Austin, Texas, on March 10, 2025, the evidence presents conflicting information regarding the hit list.

Some sources, such as ABC News and Global News, do not mention any connection to a Ukrainian hit list. However, The Investigate Earth Conspiracy Podcast and The Latin Times report that White may have been on a Ukrainian hit list, with the latter stating that Alex Jones and his supporters allege this.

Therefore, the claim's veracity is uncertain, as it relies on allegations and conspiracy theories. More information is needed to verify the claim.

Fox 7 Austin ([Source](https://www.fox7austin.com/news/infowars-writer-shooting-austin-police-jamie-white)) reports that Jamie White, an InfoWars writer, was shot and killed on March 10 in Austin, Texas, while interrupting a vehicle burglary. <image:9068>, <image:9071>, <image:9072>, <image:9073>, <image:9074>

ABC News ([Source](https://abcnews.go.com/US/infowars-reporter-shot-dead-apartment-after-possibly-interrupting/story?id=119677965)) reports that Jamie White was shot dead on March 9, 2025, in Austin, Texas, after interrupting burglars. <image:9075> The article does not mention any connection to a Ukrainian hit list. 6abc.com ([Source](https://6abc.com/post/jamie-white-infowars-reporter-shot-dead-outside-apartment/16007913/)) also reports on the death of Jamie White. <image:9085>, <image:9084>

## Elaboration
The claim that Jamie White was on a Ukrainian enemies hit list is not definitively supported by the evidence. While multiple sources confirm that Jamie White, an InfoWars writer, was shot dead in Austin, Texas, on March 10, 2025, the evidence presents conflicting information regarding the hit list.

Some sources, such as ABC News and Global News, do not mention any connection to a Ukrainian hit list. However, The Investigate Earth Conspiracy Podcast and The Latin Times report that White may have been on a Ukrainian hit list, with the latter stating that Alex Jones and his supporters allege this.

Therefore, the claim's veracity is uncertain, as it relies on allegations and conspiracy theories. More information is needed to verify the claim.

 When the ten were interviewed, "none recalled any circumstance under which the White House had solicited or accepted political help from other countries, and all said they would have considered the very idea out of bounds."[\[403\]](#cite_note-AbsolutelyCouldNot-407)

In an op-ed in _The Washington Post_, 17 former members of the [Watergate scandal](/wiki/Watergate_scandal "Watergate scandal")

Multiple tweets, posted between November 12-15, 2022, claim that Ukraine sent billions of dollars sourced from foreign aid to FTX, which was then sent back to the Democratic party.

The claim has been spread by a number of prominent right-leaning commentators and politicians, including [Madison Cawthorn](https://twitter.com/CawthornforNC)
, [James Woods](https://twitter.com/RealJamesWoods/status/1592041414829166592)
, [Calvin Robinson](https://twitter.com/calvinrobinson/status/1592031504875544577)

 and [Jack Posobiec](https://twitter.com/JackPosobiec/status/1591855516053303298)
, among others.

Various iterations of the narrative took root on conspiracy theory subreddits, 4Chan, and other fringe online spaces.

The collapse of FTX has had a staggering impact on the world of cryptocurrencies, resulting in a dominoes-like collapse of popular cryptos, such as [Bitcoin](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/bitcoin)
, the value of [which fell to a two-year-low](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/09/bitcoin-falls-below-17k-amid-latest-ftx-meltdown/)
, and shaking the industry as a whole.

To understand if and how its demise is connected to U.S. dollar, though that may be no longer [tenable](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/10/tethers-usdt-stablecoin-slips-from-1-peg/)
).

Everstake, a crypto firm involved in setting up the donations, [has responded on Twitter](https://twitter.com/everstake_pool/status/1592621937054085120)
 to claims that these funds were illegally transferred to the Democrats, stating Aid for Ukraine had used FTX "only a few times in March 2022 exclusively to convert crypto donations into fiat" which it said The National Bank of Ukraine [had confirmed receipt of.](https://twitter.com/NBUkraine/status/1502207218514604034)

It added that of the $60 million received through Aid For Ukraine, $54 million had been spent on "Ukraine's humanitarian and military needs." Ukraine's Vice Prime Minister Fedorov Mykhailo made the same claim on Twitter, and included what he said was a [breakdown of this spending.](https://twitter.com/FedorovMykhailo/status/1559923193581899777)

Everstake added that the funds received were not stored on FTX and could be "converted into fiat elsewhere if necessary."

Its CEO Sergey Vasylchuk [took to Twitter](https://twitter.com/everstake_pool/status/1592622417226366977)
 as well, alleging that the claim was part of a Russian disinformation effort.

"Every time Russia is defeated on the battlefield, it starts looking for another way to cover up its military failures in the media by spreading fake news based on made-up assumptions," Vasylchuk said.

"This time, they decided to use the FTX collapse to spin yet another tale about money laundering. aid misappropriated?
-----------------------------

The claim that funds were effectively "laundered" from Ukraine via FTX back into the U.S., less so to the Democratic party coffers or Biden himself, is unevidenced.

_Newsweek_ has investigated the coverage of this claim across social media and larger media outlets and could find no transaction ID, statements, or any other tangible evidence to support the idea that U.S. government funding—under the nose of a multi-million dollar oversight process coordinated between the Office of Inspector General, the DOD and USAID—it would require a major lapse in oversight from those auditing Ukraine and a breakdown of protections in place to ensure funds could not be re-appropriated.

Furthermore, funding for Ukraine [received bipartisan support](https://www.newsweek.com/these-69-house-reps-voted-against-providing-ukraine-aid-1686658)
, meaning that both Democrats and Republicans signed off on the terms of the funding and how it would be managed.

In response to these claims Alex Bornyakov, Deputy Minister of Digital Transformation of Ukraine on IT industry development [tweeted:](https://twitter.com/abornyakov/status/1592241279051743233)
 "A fundraising crypto foundation [@\_AidForUkraine](https://twitter.com/_AidForUkraine)

Did FTX send Ukrainian crypto donations to the U.S.?
----------------------------------------------------

FTX has also played a role in providing Ukraine with the capability to receive cryptocurrency donations since Russia's invasion.

In [March 2022](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/03/14/ukraine-partners-with-ftx-everstake-to-launch-new-crypto-donation-website/)
, the Ukrainian government launched a crypto donations website, Aid for Ukraine, with the backing of FTX, to route donated crypto to the National Bank of Ukraine. According [to its website](https://aid-for-ukraine.io/)
, Aid for Ukraine has received more than $60 million in donations including [611 Bitcoin](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/357a3So9CbsNfBBgFYACGvxxS6tMaDoa1P)
, [10,723 Ethereum](https://www.blockchain.com/eth/address/0x165CD37b4C644C2921454429E7F9358d18A45e14)
, and 15,048,821 USDT (which is at least on paper supposed to be pegged to the U.S. foreign aid receives to ensure that it is spent appropriately on measures relating to Ukrainian assistance.

For example, under the Additional Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Act 2022, the bill behind the $40 billion in emergency funding to Ukraine, $5 million was spent on oversight of the funds alone, including by the Department of State Inspector General and the USAID Inspector General.

The Office of Inspector General Oversight in the Department of Defence (DOD OIG) and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID OIG) both provide audits of the use of funding in Ukraine and investigate complaints and allegations of misuse or attempted misuse of [USAID funding](https://oig.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/2022-11/Office%20of%20Investigations%20Ukraine%20Briefing%20Sheet%20-%20Oct%2022.pdf)

CLAIM: U.S. The company filed for bankruptcy protection amid news it was short billions of dollars and may have been hacked.

The move has fueled baseless conspiracy theories on social media around the embattled former CEO’s donations, FTX, and Democrats who ran in this year’s midterm elections.

“So Biden gave loads of money to Ukraine, who gave loads of money to FTX, who gave loads of money to Democrats,” reads one tweet with over 100,000 likes.

“For an entire year Democrat law makers have stood on the House floor and demanded taxpayer $$ for Ukraine. The ministry said it “provided informational support” to the foundation, which was run by the cryptocurrency exchange Kuna and the blockchain company Everstake.

In early March, Aid For Ukraine began working with FTX to convert cryptocurrency donations into Ukraine’s government-issued currency, a partnership that ended in April 2022, according to the ministry.

Sergey Vasylchuk, the CEO of Everstake, told the AP that cryptocurrencies were an efficient way to raise funds for Ukraine to defend itself amid Russia’s invasion. The donations would then get sent to the [National Bank of Ukraine](https://twitter.com/NBUkraine/status/1502207218514604034)
 and no crypto was stored on FTX.

“It was eight months ago and the goal was that Aid for Ukraine was to supply the needs as soon as possible,” Vasylchuk said when asked about the relationship between Aid for Ukraine and FTX. FTX’s co-CEO [Ryan Salame](https://www.fec.gov/data/receipts/individual-contributions/?contributor_name=Ryan+Salame&two_year_transaction_period=2022&min_date=01%2F01%2F2021&max_date=12%2F31%2F2022)
 also donated to groups that supported Republican candidates in 2022, including the Senate Leadership Fund, the Congressional Leadership Fund and American Dream Federal Action, which he [founded](https://americandreamaction.com/adfa-founder-pandemic-prevention-one-of-best-things-we-can-do-for-future-generations/)
.

White House spokesperson Robyn Patterson said any claim that U.S. officials [announced](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-europe-congress-government-and-politics-f72e45a5229fa311819b83dcbb2e5216)
 earlier this month the country will send $400 million more in military aid to Ukraine, including funding for ammunition and air defense systems."

From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Trump%E2%80%93Ukraine_scandal): 
Content: The search result from Wikipedia discusses the 2019 Trump–Ukraine scandal, including allegations that Trump requested investigations into Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden. It also mentions the withholding of aid to Ukraine and the involvement of Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian energy company where Hunter Biden served on the board. The article also mentions the 2016 Democratic National Committee email leak. The article does not mention any information about US aid being laundered and sent back to Democrat candidates.


From [Source](https://www.newsweek.com/what-behind-claim-joe-biden-laundered-billions-ukraine-aid-via-ftx-1759774): 
Content: Newsweek published an article discussing the claim that US aid to Ukraine was laundered and sent to Democrat candidates. The article mentions that the claim originated from social media posts and was spread by right-leaning commentators. It also mentions that the Ukrainian government launched a crypto donations website, Aid for Ukraine, with the backing of FTX, to route donated crypto to the National Bank of Ukraine in March 2022. The article states that there is no evidence to support the claim that funds were laundered from Ukraine via FTX back into the U.S. <image:2147>. The article also mentions that funding for Ukraine received bipartisan support.

The search results discuss the claim that US aid to Ukraine was laundered and sent to Democrat candidates. One source, from Wikipedia, discusses the 2019 Trump–Ukraine scandal but does not mention the claim. Another source, from Newsweek, states that the claim originated from social media and right-leaning commentators, but there is no evidence to support it.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that the claim is likely false. The Newsweek article states that the claim originated on social media and from right-leaning commentators, with no supporting evidence. The Associated Press fact-check also found the claim to be false. The image shows Joe Biden and Sam Bankman-Fried, the co-CEO of FTX, which backed the Ukrainian government's crypto donation website. However, the evidence does not suggest any connection between the US aid to Ukraine and the laundering of funds to Democrat candidates.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

The evidence indicates that the claim is likely false. The Newsweek article states that the claim originated on social media and from right-leaning commentators, with no supporting evidence. The Associated Press fact-check also found the claim to be false. The image shows Joe Biden and Sam Bankman-Fried, the co-CEO of FTX, which backed the Ukrainian government's crypto donation website. However, the evidence does not suggest any connection between the US aid to Ukraine and the laundering of funds to Democrat candidates.


## Final Judgement
The search results and fact-checks indicate that the claim is not supported by evidence. The claim originated from social media and right-leaning commentators, and the Associated Press found the claim to be false.

`false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim that US aid to Ukraine was laundered and sent to Democrat candidates is not supported by evidence. A search revealed that the claim originated on social media and from right-leaning commentators, and a fact-check by the Associated Press found the claim to be false.

The death toll from a devastating storm that battered the southeastern United States climbed to at least 130 on Monday, as the disaster became a hot topic in an already bitter election campaign, with the [White House](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/white-house/)
 angrily refuting claims it had been slow to respond.

With hundreds still missing across several southeastern US states and the death toll climbing, President Joe Biden announced he would travel to storm-ravaged North Carolina Wednesday to monitor rescue efforts.

Biden also accused former president Donald Trump of spreading lies, after the Republican presidential candidate charged, without evidence, that the federal government was ignoring the disaster brought on by Hurricane Helene and denying help to his supporters.

"He's lying," Biden told reporters in the Oval Office, adding that he had spoken to North Carolina governor Ray Cooper "and he told him he's lying. A president's role is usually to oversee and coordinate aid, including funding.

Scientists say [climate change](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/climate-change/)
 likely plays a role in the rapid intensification of hurricanes, because there is more energy in warmer oceans for them to feed on, and Biden stressed as much Monday.

"Absolutely, positively, unequivocally, yes, yes, yes, yes," Biden told reporters in the Oval Office when asked if climate change was to blame for the trail of destruction left by the storm.

Drowned in their homes
----------------------

The sheriff's office in Pinellas County, Florida, published a grim litany of the nine lives lost there so far, almost all of whose bodies were found in their homes.

Nearly all appeared to have drowned, it said, describing some found still lying in several inches of water, while others were buried under debris.

In Georgia, residents faced power cuts, supply shortages, blocked roads and broken communication lines in often mountainous terrain, with Governor Brian Kemp describing the storm as a "250-mile wide tornado."

Close to two million households and businesses remained without power on Monday, according to tracker poweroutage.us.

Cooper, the North Carolina governor, said Monday that hundreds of roads had been destroyed and many communities were "wiped off the map."

"This is an unprecedented storm," he told reporters.  "The emotional and physical toll here is indescribable."

Cooper, a Democrat, also thanked Biden for providing federal personnel and resources.

Biden defends government response as Hurricane Helene death toll reaches 130
============================================================================

Americas

The death toll from a storm in the southeastern US reached 130 on Monday, sparking election campaign tensions. "The vice president, she's out someplace, campaigning, looking for money," he said, referring to his election rival, Vice President Kamala Harris.

"We're not talking about politics now," he said later, wearing a bright red "Make America Great Again" hat while standing in the rubble of a furniture store.

Democrat Harris, canceled campaign events to return to Washington Monday for a briefing on the federal response.

"Over the past few days, our nation has endured some of the worst destruction and devastation that we have seen in quite some time," Harris said following the briefing.

"And we have responded with our best, with the best folks who are on the ground and here doing the kind of work that is about rising to a moment of crisis."

Responding to Trump's criticism that he was "sleeping" instead of dealing with the storm damage, Biden defended his decision to spend the weekend at his home in Delaware, saying he was working "the whole time."

When a major natural disaster hits the United States, the federal government responds at the request of states. that's simply not true, and it's irresponsible."

At least 118 people were killed by the storm and associated flooding -- 49 in North Carolina, 25 in South Carolina, 25 in Georgia, 14 in Florida, four in Tennessee and one in Virginia, according to tallies from local authorities compiled by AFP.

Emergency workers continued a grim search for hundreds of people still unaccounted for across the affected states, where torrential rains brought widespread havoc.

They also worked to restore [water](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/water/)
 and power supply to the affected areas, remove fallen trees, deliver supplies and register people for disaster assistance.

The death toll was expected to rise, authorities warned, with cell phone service knocked out across much of the region and up to 600 people still missing.

Biden accused of 'sleeping' 
----------------------------

With Biden preparing to head to North Carolina, Trump on Monday arrived in Georgia, another epicenter of the destruction -- and both are among the key swing states where the US election will be decided in just five weeks' time.

In the city of Valdosta, Georgia, Trump vowed to "bring lots of relief material, including fuel, equipment, water, and other things" to those in need.

"The federal government is not being responsive," he told reporters."

President Joe Biden has said the "irresponsible and relentless promotion of disinformation and outright lies" about the government's hurricane response is "undermining confidence" in rescue and recovery efforts, even as Hurricane Milton heads towards Florida.

Since Hurricane Helene caused widespread damage in several states, misleading and false claims have been spreading and have intensified as Florida prepares for a new hurricane.

Against the backdrop of the election campaign, Donald Trump has been highly critical of the Biden-Harris administration's response.

Biden has responded by condemning a number of claims by Trump and other Republicans - BBC Verify has been examining them.

Has government money for hurricane victims been spent on migrants?
------------------------------------------------------------------

At multiple campaign events since the hurricane struck, Trump and his allies have claimed that government money earmarked for disaster victims has been spent on migrants who crossed illegally into the US.

“Kamala spent all her Fema money - billions of dollars - on housing for illegal migrants," Trump said in Michigan last week.

This claim is false.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), a government agency, has a Disaster Relief Fund - worth more than $20bn (£15bn) for the last financial year - which is ring-fenced to spend on responding to hurricanes and other natural disasters.

Fema also has a dedicated budget from Congress to be spent on food, shelter, transportation, and other support services for immigrants released from Department of Homeland Security (DHS) custody.

This budget amounts to around $1bn over the last two financial years - not the “billions” Trump claims.

So, these are two separate pots of money - administered by the agency - which Trump appears to be conflating.

Fema, which has now set up a [fact-checking page](https://www.fema.gov/disaster/current/hurricane-helene/rumor-response)
 on its website, called Trump's claim "false" saying, "no money is being diverted from disaster response needs".

In 2019, while Trump was president, money was diverted [from Fema's Disaster Relief Fund](https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/fema_-_disaster_relief_fund_-_september_2019.pdf)
 - around $38m - to give to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

The focus on Fema's current funding comes after the Secretary of Homeland Security, Alejandro Mayorkas - who oversees the agency - warned that it was running low on funds for the rest of the hurricane season.

But Fema says it has “enough money right now for immediate response and recovery needs”.

[Political row erupts over Hurricane Helene disaster relief\
----------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y3qgqxpwno)

Are hurricane victims only getting $750?
----------------------------------------

Donald Trump and his running mate JD Vance have repeatedly highlighted a $750 payment from Fema to hurricane victims, often contrasting it with the money the US government spends on Ukraine or on illegal migrants.

“They promised $750 to American citizens who have lost everything,” Vance said at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania on Saturday.

It is true that the victims are getting $750 but some context is needed.

This is just one type of assistance provided by Fema.

The $750 is what people can get as an [upfront payment](https://www.fema.gov/node/fema-will-only-provide-750-disaster-survivors-support-their-recovery)
 to help cover the costs of food, water, medication, and other emergency supplies.

Following this initial payment, disaster victims may receive additional funds following a Fema assessment.

This can go towards repairing damage to homes and personal property, and to help find a temporary place to stay.

So far, [Fema has said that more than $210m](https://www.fema.gov/press-release/20241007/federal-assistance-hurricane-helene-exceeds-210-million-fema-prepares-dual)
 has been given to communities affected by Hurricane Helene - this includes upfront payments and money to support housing needs.

! By the time Trump made this remark on 5 October, the North Carolina National Guard, which is under the dual command of federal and state governments, had already [posted on X](https://x.com/ncnationalguard/status/1841976269941952920?s=46)
 that its “air assets have completed 146 flight missions, resulting in the rescue of 538 people and 150 pets”.

The post, published on 3 October, featured a video of a National Guard helicopter.

The [North Carolina Department of Public Safety's website](https://www.ncdps.gov/news/press-releases/2024/10/05/hurricane-helene-recovery-progresses-western-north-carolina)
 says that President Biden approved the state governor’s request for military personnel and equipment to support rescue operations in North Carolina.

The National Guard and military personnel “are operating 50 helicopters” as part of search and rescue missions, and are also helping to deliver critical supplies in the state, the department said.

JD Vance criticised Fema's response to the hurricane at a rally in Butler on Saturday

Did Biden call the Governor of Georgia?
---------------------------------------

When the hurricane first hit, Trump claimed that the governor of Georgia hadn’t spoken to President Biden following the state being badly affected.

“He has been calling the president, hasn't been able to get him,” Trump said at a news conference in Georgia on the afternoon of 30 September.

But earlier that day, Georgia’s Governor Brian Kemp - a Republican - said in an interview: “The president just called me yesterday afternoon, I missed him and called him right back, and he just said ‘hey what do you need?’ and I told him we’ve got what we need, we’re working through the federal process.”

“He offered if there’s other things we need to call him directly, which I appreciate,” he added.

Content: "In a brief exchange with reporters, he described the impact of the storm as “stunning” and said that the administration is giving states “everything we have” to help with their response to the storm.

Biden planned to speak about the administration’s response efforts in remarks from the White House on Monday.

The White House also said Vice President Kamala Harris will visit the storm-ravaged areas “as soon as it is possible without disrupting emergency response operations.” At a Las Vegas rally Sunday night, Harris spoke about the impact of Helene, saying, “I know everyone here sends their thoughts and prayer for the folks who have been so devastated by that hurricane.”

She added: “We will stand with these communities for as long as it takes and make sure they are able to rebuild.”

Harris was spending Sunday night in Las Vegas and had planned campaign stops in the city on Monday. Harris received similar briefings while on board Air Force Two, according to the White House.

The White House said Biden directed Criswell to figure out what can be done to accelerate support to isolated communities that are having difficulty accessing assistance.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence does not support the claim. While the Associated Press reported that President Biden said he would visit areas impacted by Hurricane Helene on September 29, 2024, there is no mention of him announcing a halt to aid for the affected areas or additional aid for Ukraine. The France 24 article focuses on Biden's response to the hurricane, and the BBC article discusses misinformation related to the event, neither of which mentions the claim's specifics.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence.

1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

Volodymyr Zelensky (left) and Joe Biden said they would focus on Ukraine's "victory plan" at their White House talks

Volodymyr Zelensky is meeting Joe Biden and Kamala Harris at the White House to discuss his "victory plan", which the Ukrainian president hopes will pressure Russia into agreeing a diplomatic end to the war.

Details have been kept secret, but Zelensky is likely to ask the US president and vice-president for continuing military and financial support, as well as security guarantees.

It comes amid a row with Donald Trump and the Republican party ahead of November's US presidential election.

They were angered by Zelensky's visit to an arms factory in Biden's hometown of Scranton with top Democrats. Zelensky will meet Trump on Friday despite earlier reports that the meeting had been cancelled.

Zelensky's visit to the ammunition factory in the key swing state of Pennsylvania was labelled by leading Republicans as a partisan campaign event.

In a public letter, speaker of the US House Mike Johnson said the visit was "designed to help Democrats" and claimed it amounted to "election interference".

He also demanded that Ukraine fire its ambassador to Washington who helped arrange the visit.

The Republican-led House Oversight Committee has also announced it would investigate whether Zelensky's trip was an attempt to use a foreign leader to benefit Harris's campaign.

Her Republican rival for the presidency, Donald Trump, mocked Zelensky at a campaign event as the "greatest salesman on Earth" and accused him of refusing to "make a deal" with Moscow.

Earlier this week, Trump also praised Russia's military capabilities, saying: "They beat Hitler, they beat Napoleon - that’s what they do, they fight."

The two men have long had a fractious relationship. In 2019, Trump was impeached by the US House over accusations that he pressured Ukraine's leader to dig up damaging information on a political rival.

The row clouded a week in which Zelensky has twice addressed the United Nations, ramping up efforts to persuade the US and other allies to boost support more than two and a half years into Russia's full-scale invasion.

At the White House meetings, Zelensky is expected to push again for US backing to fire Western-made long-range missiles deep into Russian territory, which Biden has so far blocked.

Before the meeting, Biden said: "Let me be clear, Russia will not prevail in war... Ukraine will prevail".

He also pledged to support Kyiv "in its path to membership to both the EU and Nato".

Meanwhile, Zelensky thanked the US for its "unwavering bipartisan support".

He later met Harris, with the vice-president reiterating her support for Ukraine and arguing the US must continue its role of global leadership.

With Russian troops advancing in the east of Ukraine, the outcome of Zelensky's meeting with Biden and Harris is seen by many experts as a key moment in his attempt to shore up US support before the November election.

On Wednesday, Russia's Vladimir Putin announced a plan to revise Moscow's nuclear doctrine, to enable Russia to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states if they are supported by nuclear states.

Putin's spokesperson later clarified that it was meant as a "specific signal" to the West.

President Volodymyr Zelensky visited the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant alongside top Democrats on Friday

Hours before his meeting with Zelensky, Biden announced a $7.9bn (£5.9bn) package of military assistance to Ukraine.

The aid, part of a $61bn package that passed Congress in April, will be approved through presidential drawdown authority and will pull from existing Pentagon supplies to deliver the arms more quickly.

Congressional Republicans blocked the package for months earlier this year, before ultimately relenting and passing the legislation. The delay caused arms supplies to Ukraine to dry up for several months.

**Volodymyr Zelensky is meeting Joe Biden and Kamala Harris at the White House to discuss his "victory plan", which the Ukrainian president hopes will pressure Russia into agreeing a diplomatic end to the war.**

Details have been kept secret, but Zelensky is likely to ask the US president and vice-president for continuing military and financial support, as well as security guarantees.

It comes amid a row with Donald Trump and the Republican party ahead of November's US presidential election.

They were angered by Zelensky's visit to an arms factory in Biden's hometown of Scranton with top Democrats. Zelensky will meet Trump on Friday despite earlier reports that the meeting had been cancelled.

Zelensky's visit to the ammunition factory in the key swing state of Pennsylvania was labelled by leading Republicans as a partisan campaign event.

In a public letter, speaker of the US House Mike Johnson said the visit was "designed to help Democrats" and claimed it amounted to "election interference".

He also demanded that Ukraine fire its ambassador to Washington who helped arrange the visit.

The Republican-led House Oversight Committee has also announced it would investigate whether Zelensky's trip was an attempt to use a foreign leader to benefit Harris's campaign.

Her Republican rival for the presidency, Donald Trump, mocked Zelensky at a campaign event as the "greatest salesman on Earth" and accused him of refusing to "make a deal" with Moscow.

Earlier this week, Trump also praised Russia's military capabilities, saying: "They beat Hitler, they beat Napoleon - that’s what they do, they fight."

The two men have long had a fractious relationship. In 2019, Trump was impeached by the US House over accusations that he pressured Ukraine's leader to dig up damaging information on a political rival.

The row clouded a week in which Zelensky has twice addressed the United Nations, ramping up efforts to persuade the US and other allies to boost support more than two and a half years into Russia's full-scale invasion.

At the White House meetings, Zelensky is expected to push again for US backing to fire Western-made long-range missiles deep into Russian territory, which Biden has so far blocked.

Before the meeting, Biden said: "Let me be clear, Russia will not prevail in war... Ukraine will prevail".

He also pledged to support Kyiv "in its path to membership to both the EU and Nato".

Meanwhile, Zelensky thanked the US for its "unwavering bipartisan support".

He later met Harris, with the vice-president reiterating her support for Ukraine and arguing the US must continue its role of global leadership.

With Russian troops advancing in the east of Ukraine, the outcome of Zelensky's meeting with Biden and Harris is seen by many experts as a key moment in his attempt to shore up US support before the November election.

On Wednesday, Russia's Vladimir Putin announced a plan to revise Moscow's nuclear doctrine, to enable Russia to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states if they are supported by nuclear states.

Putin's spokesperson later clarified that it was meant as a "specific signal" to the West.

Hours before his meeting with Zelensky, Biden announced a $7.9bn (£5.9bn) package of military assistance to Ukraine.

The aid, part of a $61bn package that passed Congress in April, will be approved through presidential drawdown authority and will pull from existing Pentagon supplies to deliver the arms more quickly.

Congressional Republicans blocked the package for months earlier this year, before ultimately relenting and passing the legislation. The delay caused arms supplies to Ukraine to dry up for several months.

Zelensky thanked the US - Ukraine's largest foreign donor.

At the same time, he also reportedly expressed frustration at the delay in delivering weapons that were already promised when he met US congressmen on Thursday morning.

What was [Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky](https://nypost.com/2024/09/25/us-news/house-gop-accuses-kamala-harris-of-using-zelensky-as-campaign-surrogate-launches-foreign-interference-inquiry/)
 doing at what sure _looked_ like a partisan US political event this week?

And how did the White House let this happen?

Zelensky got flown into battleground Pennsylvania aboard a USAF C-17 plane on Tuesday; he then toured the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant accompanied by Gov. Josh Shapiro, Sen. Bob Casey, Rep. Matt Cartwright — the last two being active Democratic candidates.

And it looks like no GOP candidates got invited — trapping a foreign head of state into apparently taking sides in US domestic politics.

Yet Zelensky was guarded by Secret Service agents and driven around in Secret Service vehicles, adding more reek of impropriety: Who covered those expenses?

Someone in the Biden administration pulled a fast one: Pennsylvania has a fair number of anti-Russian Polish-Americans and others of Eastern European heritage who might be swayed by Zelensky’s seeming preference.

Legalities aside, this is terrible for Zelensky: Ukraine desperately needs support from Republicans as well as Democrats in Congress, and will no matter who holds the White House next year.

House Speaker Mike Johnson is calling on Zelensky to fire his US ambassador for letting this disgrace happen, a move that could mend _Ukraine’s_ fences here.

But Congress will need answers on the American side, too: After all, Democrats impeached President Donald Trump over _his_ supposed abuses linked to Ukraine; now we have the misuse of a foreign guest’s visit to influence US politics.

We absolutely endorse US support of Kyiv against Moscow’s brutal invasion: Vladimir Putin must not succeed.

And Democratic candidates have every right to slam those Republicans who want to hang Ukraine out to dry.

But dragging any foreign leader, _especially_ one who’s seeking now new support for his nation from the White House, into US politics is morally criminal — at least.

Whether at the White House or the State Department, _American_ heads need to roll over this."

BERLIN, Feb 14 (Reuters) - There must be no peace in Ukraine over the heads of Ukrainians and Europeans, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said on Friday at the start of the Munich Security Conference.

"A sham peace - over the heads of Ukrainians and Europeans - would gain nothing," Baerbock said in a statement. Treasury Department on Wednesday announced sanctions on assets of four individuals whom it linked to Mexico-based Cartel del Noreste, including the popular hip-hop artist El Makabelico.

The comment comes after U.S. President Donald Trump startled U.S. This requires tough and long-term security guarantees for Ukraine, a strong NATO and progress in Ukraine's accession negotiations with the European Union," she said.

Content: "That followed a meeting between Zelenskyy and the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, who had visited Kyiv to discuss US access to rare earth minerals, energy resources and energy assets, according to Reuters.

The US has suggested that it would seek access to [rare earth minerals](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/05/donald-trump-rare-earths-ukraine-us-trade-deal-aid-russia)
, which are strategic metals essential for industries developing computers, batteries and cutting-edge energy technology in exchange for providing military aid to Ukraine in the future.

The rapid developments have worried Europe that Putin and Trump appear to be negotiating the future of the continent’s security over the heads of the Europeans themselves.

“If Europe is responsible for Ukraine’s security and could even provide troops \[under a ceasefire agreement\], then we should have a seat at the table and be consulted with the Americans,” said one European official. Our priority right now is to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position.”

Trump’s announcement followed a prisoner swap involving [Marc Fogel,](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/11/russia-us-prisoner-trump-marc-fogel)
 a US teacher who was arrested in Moscow on drug charges, and Alexander Vinnik, who was arrested in 2017 in Greece on cryptocurrency fraud charges and then extradited to the US.

The deal was arranged by Steve Witkoff, Trump’s envoy to the Middle East, one of the president’s closest allies on the team that will lead negotiations with the Russians.

The US negotiating team would include the secretary of state, Marco Rubio; the director of the CIA, John Ratcliffe; the national security adviser, Michael Waltz; and Witkoff.

Notable for his absence from the negotiating team was Gen Keith Kellogg, whom Trump had earlier named his special envoy to Ukraine and Russia and who was in the process of meeting with European leaders to discuss the upcoming negotiations.

Yet few were convinced he spoke directly for Trump, and he offered few concrete details beyond his “deep faith” that Trump was the best person to negotiate the deal, one official said.

Trump says he has spoken to Putin and agreed to negotiate Ukraine ceasefire
===========================================================================

This article is more than 5 months old

US secretary of defence Pete Hegseth says Ukraine would have to cede territory, alarming Kyiv and European allies

[Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump)
 has said that he and [Vladimir Putin](https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin)
 have agreed to begin negotiations to broker a ceasefire in Ukraine, later adding that it was unlikely Kyiv would win back all its territory or join Nato if a deal is to be reached.

Trump said that he was “OK” with [Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine)
 not having Nato membership and that it was “unlikely” that Ukraine would take much land back in the negotiations.

Russia “took a lot of land, and they fought for that land and they lost a lot of soldiers”, he told reporters later in the Oval Office.

Trump said he was not closely concerned with which territories were handed over.

“I’m just here to try and get peace,” he said. We agreed to work together, very closely, including visiting each other’s Nations.”

The Kremlin confirmed the call and the mutual invitations for the leaders to visit each other’s countries in what would be the first visits by an American president to Russia since 2009 and the first by Putin to the US since 2015.

In its readout, the Kremlin also maintained a maximalist position, with Putin saying he “mentioned the need to eliminate the root causes of the conflict and agreed with Trump that a long-term settlement could be achieved through peaceful negotiations”.

Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy – at least in public – offered support for the talks on Wednesday, saying he and Trump had held a “meaningful” conversation by phone. As President Trump said, let’s get it done.”

'I don't think it's practical': Trump on Nato membership for Ukraine – video

Trump told reporters that the US would seek to “secure” future military aid against Ukrainian rare earth minerals and other natural resources.

Trump said he was not concerned about freezing out Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy of the talks, saying: “I don’t think so as long as he’s there.”

But, he said, “sometime \[Ukraine’s\] going to have to have elections too … His poll numbers aren’t particularly great.”

Trump said Zelenskyy would meet on Friday with the vice-president, JD Vance, and the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, on the sidelines of the Munich security conference.

Earlier on Wednesday, the US negotiating position was outlined in Brussels, where secretary of defence Pete Hegseth delivered public remarks that [Kyiv must acknowledge that it cannot win back all the land occupied by Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/12/us-no-longer-primarily-focused-on-europes-security-says-pete-hegseth)
.

“We must start by recognising that returning to Ukraine’s pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic objective,” Hegseth said, sketching out an initial position for any peace negotiations with Russia.

“Chasing this illusory goal will only prolong the war and cause more suffering,” he added, though this could be interpreted as in effect acknowledging the annexation of Crimea, and large parts of the Donbas, by Russia.

Kyiv would only achieve peace through “robust security guarantees”, but Hegseth ruled out Nato membership for Ukraine. The German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said that Ukraine’s interests must be protected in the upcoming negotiations between Moscow and Washington. “I don’t care so much about anything other than I want to stop having millions of people killed.”

The rapid entry into negotiations with Russia and open demands that Ukraine concede land will have set alarm bells ringing in Kyiv and among its European allies that the Trump administration will offer minimal resistance to Putin’s demands in order to cut a deal as quickly as possible.

In a social media post, Trump said he held a “lengthy and highly productive phone call” with Putin and that they agreed to “have our respective teams start negotiations immediately”.

He said that he and Putin had agreed to visit each other’s countries, later telling reporters that their first meeting would take place in Saudi Arabia.

“As we both agreed, we want to stop the millions of deaths taking place in the War with Russia/Ukraine,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. That includes much of eastern Europe, including Poland and the Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia.

In December, Putin also stated that he would insist on Ukraine adopting a neutral status and implementing some degree of demilitarisation, while also demanding that the west lift its sanctions on Russia.

Kyiv has rejected those demands in the past and the Biden administration had said that it would be up to Ukraine to decide when to hold peace talks.

Earlier this week, [Zelenskyy told the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/11/zelenskyy-europe-cannot-guarantee-ukraines-security-without-america)
 that Europe was not able to offer resilient security guarantees to Kyiv without the involvement of the US. So we must accept this and figure out what we can do.”

Another senior European diplomat called the US position outlined by Hegseth a premature surrender, asking what there would be left to negotiate. The French foreign minister, Jean Noël-Barrot, called for Europe’s direct participation in the talks, saying that there “will be no just and lasting peace in Ukraine without the participation of Europeans”.

A spokesperson for the British foreign office expressed support for Trump’s desire to bring the war to an end, but added: “Russia could do this tomorrow by withdrawing its forces and ending its illegal invasion."

Content: "(Photo by Odd ANDERSEN / AFP)

A post [shared on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/urbaniulian/posts/10227566798023994)
 claims Germany threatened to cut ties with the United States.

**Verdict: Misleading**

Baerbock did not threaten to cut relations with the United States.

**Fact Check:**

Social media users are claiming that German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock threatened to cut diplomatic ties with the United States. One user wrote, “AFP:

German Foreign Minister Baerbock threatens to cut diplomatic ties with US over Ukraine: ‘We will increase pressure on the US to make it clear that they have a lot to lose if they stop supporting Europe’s liberal democracies.'”

This claim is misleading. [!CheckYourFact <image:9198>](https://checkyourfact.com/)

BERLIN — As European leaders prepare to meet in London on Sunday for an emergency summit on Ukraine, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock has called for Europe to show decisive leadership in the wake of the Oval Office [clash between U.S. and its allies, European leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, are gathering in London on Sunday to reaffirm their support for Kyiv. 

The high-stakes summit will include Zelenskyy himself, as well as other key EU leaders such as Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk and European Council President António Costa.

Germany’s foreign minister also urged the Bundestag to immediately unlock a stalled €3 billion aid package for Ukraine, while pressing the European Council to approve a broader financial and military assistance plan. 

Baerbock also issued a direct warning regarding the shifting rhetoric in Washington.

“We can never accept a reversal of perpetrator and victim,” she said. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/28/trump-vance-zelenskyy-oval-office-exchange-00206727)

In a starkly worded speech delivered Saturday in the Foreign Ministry, Baerbock warned of a “new era of ruthlessness” following Trump’s public humiliation of Zelenskyy and the U.S. administration’s shifting stance on Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

“A ruthless time has begun, in which we must defend the rules-based international order and the strength of law more than ever against the power of the strongest,” Baerbock said.

Her remarks come at a pivotal moment for transatlantic relations. Friday’s dramatic exchange in the White House saw Trump and U.S. Vice President JD Vance berating Zelenskyy, accusing Kyiv of being ungrateful and overplaying its diplomatic position.

This time Denmark has also invited the Weimar Triangle (Germany, France and Poland) to this meeting of the so‑called Nordic and Baltic 8 (NB8) taking place on the island of Bornholm in the Baltic Sea.

Top of page That is why it was so important that we did not end cooperation during Germany’s Presidency of the Council of the Baltic Sea States three years ago following Russia’s aggression but that we worked without Russia to strengthen and expand our cooperation.
> 
> We will further enhance security in the Baltic Sea region through increased NATO patrols, closer exchange of information and joint exercises. The message is clear and unambiguous: Germany is assuming its role in leading our continent. She is due to meet today and tomorrow with the foreign ministers of the Nordic and Baltic countries, that is of Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Norway and Iceland, as well as Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. On the island of Bornholm, you sense more than anywhere else how the pulsing arteries of the Baltic Sea bring together our people, our economies and our democracies, thereby forging ever closer ties. With every new shipping route, every new data cable and every new wind turbine, we are moving closer together.
> 
> However, in Bornholm, it is also particularly plain that, with regard to hybrid threats, the situation has become extremely difficult. Together we will ensure that sanctions against Russia are implemented and the Russian shadow fleet pushed back."

The evidence indicates that Annalena Baerbock did not threaten to sever ties with the US in February 2025. A fact-check from aol.com ([https://www.aol.com/fact-check-germany-did-not-142747218.html](https://www.aol.com/fact-check-germany-did-not-142747218.html)) explicitly states this.

However, Baerbock did make strong statements regarding the US's stance on Ukraine. She warned of a "new era of ruthlessness" following a meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy, as reported by Politico ([https://www.politico.eu/article/annalena-baerbock-europe-leadership-against-donald-trump-ruthlessness-ukraine/](https://www.politico.eu/article/annalena-baerbock-europe-leadership-against-donald-trump-ruthlessness-ukraine/)). She also stated that pressure was being increased on the Americans.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that while Annalena Baerbock made critical statements about the US's stance on Ukraine and Trump's actions, she did not threaten to sever ties with the US. The evidence includes a fact-check from aol.com explicitly denying the claim.

`false`

Misleading claims targeting the German chancellor have been spreading online days before German voters head to the polls to elect a new government.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](https://static.euronews.com/website/images/logos/logo-euronews-stacked-outlined-72x72-grey-9.svg) ADVERTISEMENT

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has not ordered a state of emergency in Germany over the US’s bilateral peace negotiations with Russia, despite the claim spreading widely across social platforms.

Users on X, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok falsely accused Scholz of urging parliament to impose a state of emergency — known as "Notstand" in German — that would severely curtail citizens’ rights.

But a closer look at Scholz’s speech reveals he was referring to "Notlage", an entirely different concept in the German Basic Law that refers to an urgent situation, but which is not synonymous with a government-imposed state of emergency.

Speaking over the weekend as the Trump administration geared for talks with Russian officials in the Saudi Arabian capital, Riyadh, Scholz said: “The Bundestag should pass a resolution as soon as possible according to which the war in Ukraine and its serious consequences for the security of Germany and Europe are classified as an emergency (Notlage) within the meaning of Article 115 paragraph two of the Basic Law.”

The article referenced by Scholz states that natural disasters or “exceptional emergency situations” can justify changes to the country’s so-called debt brake, allowing the government to borrow beyond the credit limit.

**What is the debt brake and how could it be used to finance defence spending?**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Germany has strict limits on government borrowing, known as a debt brake. It’s aimed at restricting the budget deficit to less than 0.35% of the country’s annual gross domestic product (GDP).

The debt brake became legally binding for the government in 2016 and for the federal states in 2020.

In recent months, both Scholz’ Social Democrats (SPD) and the Greens have advocated for suspending the debt brake in response to the war in Ukraine and the ensuing energy crisis.

Scholz’s other coalition partners, the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP), fiercely opposed the move, contributing to a breakdown in trust that collapsed the three-way coalition government last November.

Scholz has said he expects the next government, which will be elected on Sunday, to trigger this article to ramp up its spending on defence and security.

The Christian Democrats’ Friedrich Merz, who is tipped to become the next German chancellor, has also expressed [**openness**](https://www.euronews.com/business/2025/02/10/chancellor-hopeful-merz-open-to-reform-of-germanys-debt-brake)
 to loosening the debt brake once other options have been exhausted.

This is despite a broad camp of his CDU party opposing any changes to Germany's strict borrowing limits.

**Misleading claims spread days before crunch vote**
----------------------------------------------------

The misleading claims targeting Scholz come days before German voters head to the ballot boxes to elect a new government.

The Conservative Christian Democrats (CDU/CSU) are poised to emerge as the biggest party and form a government, but could be forced to rely on the support of Scholz's Social Democratic Party to do so.

The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party is currently polling in second place.

There is concern that coordinated misinformation campaigns, including those engineered by the Kremlin, could put the integrity of the vote at risk.

A German non-profit has detected Russia's well-known "Doppelgänger" campaign resurfacing, cloning the websites of renowned media outlets by purchasing similar-looking domains to spread falsified news articles.

The European Commission has attempted to minimise risks by engaging with social media platforms, including in a roundtable in Berlin and a recent [**stress test**](https://www.euronews.com/next/2025/01/24/online-platforms-participate-in-stress-test-ahead-of-german-election)
 of their of their risk mitigation measures.

Content: "President Donald Trump appears not to have told Chancellor Olaf Scholz about his impending bombshell peace plan for Ukraine, despite Germany’s crucial role in supplying arms and aid to Kyiv.

Scholz spoke to POLITICO on Wednesday, only hours before the Trump administration’s shock announcement that it would conduct peace negotiations over the head of European leaders, effectively ceding Ukrainian territory to Russia and insisting that Europe should provide the lion’s share of military and financial aid.

In his conversation with Berlin Playbook, Scholz said he had been receiving indications from Trump and his advisers that Washington would not perform such a dramatic U-turn on support for Kyiv.

“The talks that I have had with \[Trump\] and that my advisers have also had with his advisers lead to the conclusion that we can hope and assume that the U.S. troops involved in any peacekeeping operation.

The German chancellery has not yet responded to a request for comment relating to the latest developments.

On the question of whether Germany would send troops as part of a peacekeeping operation in Ukraine, Scholz suggested there would be no solution without U.S. is involved, because transatlantic unity must always be guaranteed,” Scholz said when asked whether Gemany would send troops as part of any potential peacekeeping operation.

The fact that the chancellor of the EU’s biggest economy appeared to be unaware of Washington’s plans suggests Scholz’s expectation for transatlantic unity was misguided.

Germany is second only to the U.S. Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio will meet Ukrainian leader Volodymyr  Zelenskyy.

In Munich, Vance is also [scheduled](https://www.politico.eu/article/jd-vance-and-germanys-likely-next-chancellor-set-to-talk-ukraine-trade/)
 to meet Germany’s likely next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, in what will be the first high-level meeting between a member of Trump’s second administration and the German conservatives — who are in pole position to lead the country’s next government after the Feb. 23 parliamentary election.

German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius, meanwhile, criticized Trump’s stance on negotiations with Moscow, lamenting that his administration had “made public concessions to Putin before talks even began.”

“In my view, it would have been better to discuss issues like Ukraine’s potential NATO membership or territorial losses at the negotiating table — not beforehand,” the politician from Scholz’s center-left Social Democratic Party said ahead of a meeting of NATO defense ministers in Brussels.

_Chris Lunday contributed reporting._ will continue to support Ukraine,” Scholz told POLITICO’s Berlin Playbook podcast hours before Trump effectively called time on its support for Kyiv as it resists Russia’s invasion.

Later on Wednesday, Trump announced he would begin immediate negotiations with Russian President Vladimir Putin while U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ruled out Ukrainian membership in NATO and said Europe “must provide the overwhelming share of future lethal and nonlethal aid to Ukraine.”

Hegseth also warned his counterparts at a NATO meeting in Brussels that Ukraine would not be able to take back all the territory Russia had seized, and said there would be no U.S. The country has also hosted around 1.2 million Ukrainians who have fled their country since Russia’s invasion almost three years ago.

“We have supported Ukraine over all these years,” Scholz said. “This is the basis for creating the prospect of a peaceful solution that is not a dictated peace over Ukraine. That must remain the principle, that decisions are not made over the heads of the Ukrainians.”

Scholz proposes declaring state of emergency in Germany due to war in Ukraine
=============================================================================

!Scholz proposes declaring state of emergency in Germany due to war in Ukraine <image:9229> German Chancellor Olaf Scholz (photo: Getty Images)

Author: [Kateryna Serohina](https://newsukraine.rbc.ua/author/kateryna-serohina.html)

The Bundestag should recognize the war in Ukraine as a state of emergency in terms of its consequences for Germany and Europe. Given the recent statements from representatives of the Trump administration, this issue can no longer be postponed, according to a [statement](https://x.com/Bundeskanzler/status/1890119800556339565)
 from the head of the government for the press.

According to Chancellor Olaf Scholz, the Bundestag must urgently pass a resolution classifying the war in Ukraine and its serious consequences for the security of Germany and Europe as a state of emergency under Article 115, paragraph 2 of the Constitution.

"As a result, our support for Ukraine, which is more crucial than ever, will no longer come at the expense of other tasks that our state must carry out for its citizens," the chancellor emphasized.

Scholz stressed that this is about the peace and security of our country. German Defense Minister Boris [Pistorius described these statements as concessions to Russia before negotiations even begin.](https://newsukraine.rbc.ua/news/german-defense-minister-warns-us-against-1739441277.html)

**Collective defense and security**
-----------------------------------

Chancellor Scholz also intends to advance the discussion within the EU on methods of investing in collective defense and building a powerful European defense industry.

He reminded that, at one point, he made serious decisions to decisively respond to the turning point marked by the start of Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine.

"Today, we find ourselves in a similar situation. I will not allow that to happen at this critical time for our country," the German leader promised.

Here are three highlights from their conversation:

_1) Trump has broken with both the Biden administration and European allies with his policy toward Ukraine_. vote, arguing that “Trump has decided to throw Ukraine under the bus in an effort to end the war without a plan.” While Europe has insisted on Russian concessions as part of any peace deal, Trump has sought to build leverage over Ukraine instead. “They need to get serious.” The good news is that European states are increasing their defense spending, and some leaders have proposed sending peacekeepers to enforce a ceasefire in Ukraine_._ Nevertheless, with Trump looking to move quickly, Europe may be left holding onto substantial security commitments without the capabilities ready to defend them.

Donald Trump often promised to get a deal to end the fighting in Ukraine [in one day](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/16/nx-s1-5258183/ukraine-russia-trump-peace)
, but more than four months since his second-term inauguration that goal looks as far away as ever.

Russia proposed another attempt at peace negotiations with Ukraine on Monday in Istanbul, but both sides remain firmly entrenched in their positions on territorial disputes and sovereignty that have thus far made substantial progress unlikely.

[!In this image taken from video released June 1, 2025, by a source in the Ukrainian Security Service shows a Ukrainian drone striking Russian planes deep in Russia's territory. Both sides reject the plan, with Sergey Ryabkov, a Putin foreign policy adviser, [saying](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/01/russia-cannot-accept-us-peace-plan-ukraine-current-form#:~:text=At%20the%20weekend%2C%20Donald%20Trump,had%20stalled%20in%20recent%20weeks.)
 "we can't accept it all in its current form" and Zelenskyy insisting that Ukraine will never recognize Moscow's control over Crimea. The war's a loser," Trump said then, adding that President Joe Biden had "instigated that war."

Here is a look at how the Trump administration's efforts to bring about a peace have fared.

### February

Weeks after his inauguration, Trump [made separate calls](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/12/nx-s1-5294478/hegseth-ukraine-nato-europe-trump)

"I have determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for Peace if America is involved, because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations," [Trump posted on his social media platform after the meeting](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114082877976878390)

.

Trump took to the [Truth Social platform](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114388111141848447)
 to fire back, criticizing Zelenskyy's "inflammatory statements" that would "prolong the 'killing field.'"

But Trump — who has frequently boasted about his friendship with Putin — also expressed exasperation with Russia's continued airstrikes on Kyiv. <image:9233>](https://www.npr.org/2025/06/01/nx-s1-5419509/ukraine-destroys-military-aircraft-attack-inside-russia-planes)

Meanwhile, Trump, who has been eager to bring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin to the table, has been showing signs of frustration over the process, suggesting that he is prepared to ["just back away"](https://www.npr.org/2025/05/19/nx-s1-5403585/trump-calls-putin-zelenskyy-russia-ukraine-war-talks)
 and allow the fighting to continue if the two leaders can't make progress soon.

### [Trump wants a quick end to the Ukraine war. That's a tall order](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/16/nx-s1-5258183/ukraine-russia-trump-peace)

But Samuel Charap, distinguished chair in Russia and Eurasia policy at the RAND research institute, says "If 'walking away' just means that the president is less engaged and leaves it more to working-level officials ... He can come back when he is ready for Peace."

### March

Just days after Zelenskyy's meeting in the Oval Office, the White House announced it was [suspending critical aid](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/03/nx-s1-5316899/trump-pauses-ukraine-military-aid)
 and intelligence sharing with Ukraine — a decision that risked undermining Kyiv's position on the battlefield and potentially giving Russian forces a strategic advantage.

Ukraine announced it would accept a limited 30-day ceasefire, provided Russian forces reciprocated. <image:9239>](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/21/nx-s1-5302560/ukraine-russia-ceasefire-trump-putin)

Trump says US will 'pass' on Ukraine peace talks if no progress soon

Watch: Trump says US will 'take a pass' if no progress in Ukraine talks

Donald Trump has said the US will "take a pass" on brokering further Russia-Ukraine talks if Moscow or Kyiv "make it very difficult" to reach a peace deal.

The US president told reporters in the Oval Office on Friday that he was not expecting a truce to happen in "a specific number of days" but he wanted it done "quickly".

His comments came hours after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned that the US would abandon talks unless there were clear signs of progress within days.

"We're not going to continue with this endeavour for weeks and months on end," Rubio said, adding that the US had "other priorities to focus on".

This comes as Russian strikes on Ukraine continue, with two people reported killed and more than 100 injured in the north-eastern cities of Kharkiv and Sumy on Friday.

Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and Russian troops have been advancing - albeit slowly - in eastern Ukraine.

President Vladimir Putin has placed a number of conditions on any potential ceasefire.

Trump's direct diplomacy with Putin and sharp criticism of Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky have raised concern among Nato allies, who argue that support for Kyiv must be maintained.

----------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cy5rqvqg36qo)

When asked about a deal between Russia and Ukraine on Friday, Trump said: "We're talking about here people dying. But we have a deal on that".

Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze, an MP and the chair of Ukraine's parliamentary committee on EU Integration, told the BBC the Ukrainian parliament would have "the last word" in the deal.

She added: "I hope that there will be enough reasoning to ensure that whatever is signed, and if it is going to be ratified that it is in the interest of our country and our people".

On Thursday, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha met Rubio and Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff in Paris to discuss how to end the war.

Sybiha said they had "discussed the paths to a fair and lasting peace, including full ceasefire, multinational contingent, and [security guarantees](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c93g12g38n4o)
 for Ukraine".

"Now if, for some reason, one of the two parties makes it very difficult, we're just going to say, 'you're fools, you're horrible people,' and we're going to just take a pass."

Despite the Trump administration's initial confidence that it could secure a deal quickly, attempts to reach a full ceasefire have yet to materialise, with Washington blaming both sides.

Following a meeting with European leaders in Paris about a potential ceasefire on Thursday, Rubio told reporters on Friday: "We need to determine very quickly now - and I'm talking about a matter of days - whether or not this is doable."

"If it's not going to happen, then we're just going to move on," he said about truce talks.

He admitted that a peace deal would be difficult to strike.

Trump had said before he re-entered office that he would stop the fighting in the first 24 hours of his presidency.

"It's not our war": US Secretary of State Marco Rubio threatens to move on from Ukraine peace talks

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, when asked to respond to Trump saying he expected an answer from Russia on a ceasefire, said "the negotiations taking place are quite difficult".

"The Russian side is striving to reach a peace settlement in this conflict, to ensure its own interests, and is open to dialogue," he said.

During a meeting with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni in Rome on Friday, US Vice-President JD Vance said he was still "optimistic" about ending the Ukraine war.

"I want to update the prime minister on some of the negotiations between Russia, Ukraine, and also some of the things that have happened even in the past 24 hours," he said.

"I won't prejudge them, but we do feel optimistic that we can hopefully bring this war - this very brutal war - to a close."

Vance's comments followed separate news that Ukraine and the US took the first step towards striking a minerals deal, after an initial agreement was derailed when a February meeting between Trump and President Zelensky erupted into a public shouting match.

On Thursday, the two countries signed a memorandum of intent on setting up an investment fund for Ukraine's reconstruction as part of an economic partnership agreement.

The aim is to finalise the deal by 26 April, the memo published by the Ukrainian government says.

The details of any deal remain unclear. Previous leaks have suggested the agreement has been extended beyond minerals to control of Ukraine's energy infrastructure, as well as its oil and gas.

Ukrainian negotiators have tried to resist Trump's demands that a joint investment fund would pay back the US for previous military aid, but have seemingly accepted his claim that it would help the country recover after the war ends.

The memo said the "American people desire to invest alongside the Ukrainian people in a free, sovereign and secure Ukraine".

Zelensky had been hoping to use the deal to secure a US security guarantee in the event of a ceasefire deal, telling European leaders last month that "a ceasefire without security guarantees is dangerous for Ukraine".

The US has so far resisted providing Kyiv with security guarantees.

The White House argues the mere presence of US businesses would put off Russia from further aggression, but that did not exactly work when they invaded in 2022.

, with pictures of Svyrydenko and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent separately signing the document over an online call.

"There is a lot to do, but the current pace and significant progress give reason to expect that the document will be very beneficial for both countries," Svyrydenko wrote.

Bessent said the details were still being worked out but the deal is "substantially what we'd agreed on previously."

Trump hinted at the deal during a press conference with Meloni, saying "we have a minerals deal which I guess is going to be signed on (next) Thursday..."

A video claiming that USAID, the US government's main overseas aid agency, has paid Hollywood celebrities millions of dollars to visit Ukraine has gone viral on social media and has been amplified by high-profile accounts like Elon Musk.

However, the clip is not real and has hallmarks of a Russian disinformation operation that the BBC has previously investigated.

BBC Verify's Olga Robinson explains why.

CNN  — 

Some 400 calls for help went unanswered when the helpline at Ukraine’s Veteran Hub went silent for a week after key funding from the United States was abruptly cut last month.

The Ukrainian NGO gets all sorts of calls. “We don’t know how many of those (unanswered) calls were of that nature,” she added.

Kostyna and her colleagues had no choice but to shut the helpline down last month after receiving a [stop-work order](https://cnn.com/2025/02/04/politics/usaid-officials-administrative-leave/index.html)
 from the United States Department of State – a direct consequence of President Donald Trump’s decision to suspend nearly all US foreign aid.

The freeze is already causing hardship across Ukraine, with lifesaving projects suddenly put on hold.

Ukraine has been by far the biggest recipient of USAID funds in the past three years, ever since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of the country in February 2022.

According to the agency’s now defunct website, USAID has provided Ukraine with a total of $37.6 billion in humanitarian aid, development assistance and direct budget support since the full-scale war began.

Trump and his allies have said the agency, created by the US legislature as an independent body, is overtly partisan. Opposition lawmakers and [former USAID administrators](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/05/politics/usaid-former-leaders-letter-trump/index.html)
 from both political parties have rejected that assertion and called for America’s foreign assistance programs to be protected.

After the European Union, the US is Ukraine’s biggest donor of humanitarian aid, providing more than a quarter of all the country receives. It received a request last week to cover the cost of an MRI scan for a severely ill HIV patient in an intensive care unit.

![WASHINGTON, DC - JANUARY 30: The US Agency of International Development (USAID) flag flies outside the agency's headquarters building on January 30, 2024, in Washington, DC. But those services that are vital are being restored,” she said, adding that she is now reaching out to her former project coordinators to figure out how to proceed.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio claimed last week that the US has continued to provide lifesaving humanitarian aid despite the freeze, but multiple USAID staff and contractors who have spoken to CNN say that’s not reflective of the [situation on the ground](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/04/world/usaid-us-foreign-aid-freeze-humanitarian-crises-intl/index.html?utm_source=cnn_Five+Things+for+Friday%2C+February+7%2C+2025&utm_medium=email&bt_ee=AG1SzXEI7GWm88qyexbMHAzSjWhl88ZHyrzjc11VEMzw7V7vdjFDCKslX1m3cO3t&bt_ts=1738929453068)

‘On the verge of a disaster’

The rural community of Shevchenkove in the Mykolaiv region of southern Ukraine has been hit hard by the war. Pylypenko said the children who were due to attend had seen their original schools destroyed during the occupation, only for another at which they were attending classes to be hit by a Russian drone last summer.

Pylypenko now hopes they can have the new space ready for September, but if Trump’s freeze is renewed, alternative funding will need to be found, “God willing.”

![Students take part in a lesson in a shelter underneath the Snihurivka Lyceum in September 2024 in Mykolaiv Region, Ukraine.](https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ap25017357509745.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill)

But what worries Pylypenko the most is the freeze impacting Ukraine’s access to the training programs provided by USAID. These tend to focus on local government, anti-corruption, efficiency and democracy-building, and they are key for Ukraine’s future development, as well as its hopes of eventually joining the European Union.

“These were good training programs, plus there was exchange of experiences with the best communities, and the level (of performance) rose significantly,” he said, likening the USAID programs to the proverb about teaching people to fish, rather than just sending them fish to eat.

Working for free
----------------

Kostyna first launched the Veteran Hub in 2016, after a firsthand experience with trauma. It is by far the biggest donor of military aid.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said his government was trying to find alternative sources of funding from within Ukraine and abroad. She said that the freeze meant she had to let go of an experienced project coordinator for two programs funded by USAID.

Vykhid has been a USAID partner since 2004. It serves roughly 5,000 clients at any given time, including drug users, newly diagnosed people and long-term patients.

The foundation relies on USAID for more than half of its funding, although there were times in the past when it was its only source."

 appears to feature an audio recording of US President Donald Trump criticising the UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer over aid to Ukraine, energy costs and jobs.

But the audio has been generated by AI and overlaid onto a [video interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g)
 Mr Trump did with podcaster Theo Von on 21 August 2024.

Neither Mr Trump or Mr Von discuss the UK or Ukraine in this video, but instead focus on US healthcare reform, border security and President Trump’s reasons for avoiding drinking and smoking.

**How did we know this was AI-generated?**

We contacted Professor **Hany Farid**, who specialises in digital forensics at the University of California, Berkeley, and is Chief Science Officer at GetReal Labs, a cybersecurity company focused on preventing malicious threats from generative AI.

In a wide-ranging conversation on [Theo Von's podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g)
, [former President Donald Trump](https://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/donald-trump/)
 asked the comedian at one point about his use of cocaine, alcohol and history with addiction.

The latest episode of Von's podcast, "[This Past Weekend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g)
" posted Tuesday and was filmed at the Trump National Golf Club Bedminster in Bedminster, New Jersey.

During the episode, Von asked Trump about not drinking and smoking, to which Trump replied that [he never has](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2018/10/01/donald-trump-beer-joke/1488351002/)
, mentioning his older brother, Fred Trump Jr., who he said had a problem with alcohol.

"I tell people, no drugs, no drinking, no cigarettes," Trump said. "I tell that to my kids all the time, I say 'no drugs, no drinking, no smoking.'"

Trump said he looked up to and admired his brother, who died in 1981, calling him an "incredible personality." He added that he's heard alcohol is "tougher to get off of than drugs," to which Von said that he himself is in recovery from drug and alcohol use.

The former president discussed a variety of other topics during the episode, including his relationship with his family, health care, lobbying, President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris and the 2024 presidential election.

**2024 Presidential Election:** [Donald Trump (pretty much) sticks to the script on Harris. Von said, "No, it's horrible, but you do it anyway, just like the guy you're saying with the scotch," referring to an earlier conversation about alcohol.

Trump asked Von which substance he thought was a bigger problem in the U.S.: alcohol or opioids, to which Von responded opioids.

"It is the latest in a long string of assertions by Russian officials, media, and the pro-Kremlin online ecosystem that Ukrainian officials are corrupt and use foreign aid money to enrich themselves." Léa Ronzaud, a senior investigator at research firm Graphika, told NPR in an email.

"It's just so typical of what we see from Russia, \[to\] take advantage of an ongoing crisis for their own ends," said Darren Linvill, a communications professor and co-director of Clemson University's Media Forensics Hub.

The Ukrainian general story first emerged on a pro-Russian Telegram channel four days after the fires started in Los Angeles. Some of the posts amplifying the baseless claim falsely credited it to United24 Media, a website affiliated with the Ukrainian government.

The Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council's Center for Countering Disinformation issued a [statement](https://x.com/CforCD/status/1878381491056501245)
 describing the claim as "Russian propaganda." It said it had verified with United24 Media that it did not create or share the story.

NPR has not obtained evidence that any Ukrainian generals owned homes in Los Angeles that were destroyed by the fires. Both @OlgaBazova and Patterson's posts received user-generated community notes on X citing the Greek fact check.

The unverified claim about the alleged Ukrainian-owned mansions also appeared on other social media platforms including Tik Tok, TruthSocial and the Russian site VK, but did not gain much traction.

The story is the latest example of Russia's shift away from using fake social media profiles impersonating real people, as it did during the 2016 and 2020 U.S. Accounts tied to previous China influence operations spread false claims about the fire's origins.

While the story about Ukrainian officials got more traction than the other narratives about the fires originating from Russia-allied channels, Linvill said, it has not yet spread as widely as previous narratives linked to Russia."

!Briefing Of The Commander-In-Chief Of The Armed Forces Of Ukraine Valerii Zaluzhnyi <image:2342>

General Valerii Zaluzhnyi was among those reported to have a home in Los Angeles, even though he lives in London now as Ukraine's ambassador to the UK. The Russian propaganda effort is thus to encourage support for the war at home while making those in the West question any aid that has been sent to Kyiv.

"People predisposed to believing narratives like this will take it to be another 'false' datapoint of corruption and largesse in the Ukrainian military, and at the same time, a sweet act of karma that these imaginary mansions are burning to the ground," said Schmidt. The total value of these properties amounts to $90 million and was allegedly purchased with funds provided by the West as part of economic aid to Kyiv after the war began."

Subsequent posts [named Valerii Zaluzhnyi](https://t.me/naspravdiinfo/104501 "https://t.me/naspravdiinfo/104501")
, former Ukrainian four-star general and current ambassador of Ukraine to the United Kingdom, as being among those who have lost their homes.

Satire, But Really Disinformation
---------------------------------

The initial post on Telegram did indeed include the hashtag "сатира" (Russian for satire), but subsequent reposts lacked any mention that it was made in jest. Yet, even as "satire," it isn't clear where the humor lies in the original post, except possibly to Russian audiences who might find joy that any Ukrainian would see their home burns down in the devastating California fires.

"There is zero evidence that any Ukrainian generals own any property in L.A., much less mansions," said Dr. It's not just about the misinformation – it's about how quickly it crosses platforms and gains traction."

Disinformation Fits An Existing Narrative
-----------------------------------------

All of these disinformation campaigns have a common thread – they're based on the unsubstantiated belief that Ukrainian officials are getting rich while the war continues. Matthew Schmidt, professor of national security and political science at the University of New Haven.

Humor likely wasn't even the point, and instead, the channels posting the claims likely wanted it to be believed as fact – much like the news last summer that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spent $15 million to [buy a Mercedes 770 automobile](https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2024/10/09/despite-online-claims-ukraines-zelensky-didnt-buy-hitlers-car/ "https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2024/10/09/despite-online-claims-ukraines-zelensky-didnt-buy-hitlers-car/")
 that was previously owned by Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler, or that Zelensky's wife purchased a [Bugatti sports car](https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2024/07/02/social-media-posts-claim-zelenskys-wife-spent-millions-on-bugatti-sportscar/ "https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2024/07/02/social-media-posts-claim-zelenskys-wife-spent-millions-on-bugatti-sportscar/")

Bill Barr led the corruption inquiry in 2020

Bill Barr, the attorney general under Mr Trump, opened a justice department inquiry into the allegations in 2020.

[He told the Federalist](https://thefederalist.com/2023/06/07/exclusive-bill-barr-confirms-rep-jamie-raskin-lied-about-biden-family-corruption-investigation/)
 last month that he passed the case on to the US attorney in Joe Biden's home state of Delaware.

No charges were ever filed in the case.

White House spokesman Ian Sams said: "It is remarkable that congressional Republicans, in their eagerness to go after President Biden regardless of the truth, continue to push claims that have been debunked for years.

"It's clear that congressional Republicans are dead-set on playing shameless, dishonest politics and refuse to let truth get in the way."

Congressional Republicans learned of the existence of the FBI document detailing the informant's account earlier this year.

They had pressed FBI Director Chris Wray to provide it to the House Oversight Committee - going so far as to threaten to hold him in contempt of Congress if he refused to comply.

He eventually provided members of the committee with the opportunity to privately access a redacted version, but warned that a public release would jeopardise FBI intelligence-gathering methods.

"We have repeatedly explained to Congress, in correspondence and in briefings, how critical it is to keep this source information confidential," the FBI said in a statement.

"Today's release of the 1023 - at a minimum - unnecessarily risks the safety of a confidential source."

After a private review of the document last month, Jamie Raskin, the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, said it contained only unfounded, second-hand accusations and no new details.

The FBI officials have described FD-1023 forms as a means to document "raw, unverified" intelligence information that does not reflect the conclusions of investigators.

"Recording this information does not validate it, establish its credibility, or weigh it against other information known or developed by the FBI in our investigations," the agency said in a recent statement.

Even Senator Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican who with Mr Grassley wrote a Senate report on Hunter Biden, has sounded sceptical about the memo.

[According to the Cedar Rapids Gazette](https://www.thegazette.com/government-politics/iowas-chuck-grassley-releases-fbi-memo-with-unverified-claims-alleging-biden-bribery-scheme/)
, he told a conservative radio show host Vicki McKenna last month: "This could be coming from a very corrupt oligarch who could be making this stuff up."

**A top Senate Republican has released an FBI document detailing an allegation President Joe Biden and his son accepted bribes from a Ukrainian firm.**

Chuck Grassley, who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said: "The American people can now read this document for themselves."

The unclassified memo is a June 2020 internal FBI report outlining claims by a foreign informant.

There is no evidence that Joe Biden received any payments from Ukraine.

Senior congressional Republicans have acknowledged the allegation is unverified.

The memo contains a claim that Hunter Biden was hired by the Ukrainian energy company, Burisma, in 2013 as a way to gain support from his father, who was the US vice-president at the time.

It also alleges that Burisma made two $5m (£3.9m) payments to "the Bidens" as part of its efforts to remove Ukraine's prosecutor general at the time, Viktor Shokin - and that there were audio recordings of both Hunter and Joe Biden that supported this.

The informant told the FBI he had learned these details during conversations he had with the Burisma chief executive and other company officials in 2015 or 2016.

Senator releases FBI source's claim of Biden bribes from Ukraine
================================================================

21 July 2023

Anthony ZurcherNorth America correspondent

! He said voters could now make their own minds up "without the filter of politicians or bureaucrats".

Its public release, however, is a highly unusual move and could further inflame tensions between congressional Republicans and the FBI and Biden administration officials.

Since regaining a majority last year in the House of Representatives after four years of Democratic control, Republicans have launched a range of investigations into President Biden and his family.

The allegations detailed in the FBI document are similar to ones aired over the past several years by Mr Biden's political opponents, including former Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who had repeatedly travelled to Ukraine to conduct his own personal investigations.

Mr Giuliani's accusations against the Bidens became a focus of Mr Trump's first impeachment trial in 2019, which centred on the then-president's efforts to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to announce he was launching an investigation into Joe Biden's supposed ties to Burisma.

! <image:9305>!Getty Images Chuck Grassley <image:9310>Getty Images

Chuck Grassley said releasing the FBI document was in the public interest

Vice-President Biden had publicly pressed for Mr Shokin's removal as part of a larger effort by the Obama administration and US allies due to concerns that he was ineffective in tackling corruption in Ukraine.

Mr Grassley, an Iowa senator, says he obtained a lightly redacted copy of the memo from a justice department "whistleblower" and decided releasing it was in the public interest.

He and other Republicans have said the FBI considers the informant to be highly credible, but the report details how the informant said he could not vouch for the accuracy of the information he was passing along.

Mr Grassley [tweeted a copy of the memo](https://twitter.com/ChuckGrassley/status/1682081403742068746)
 on Thursday."

Background
----------

See also: [Conspiracy theories related to the Trump–Ukraine scandal](/wiki/Conspiracy_theories_related_to_the_Trump%E2%80%93Ukraine_scandal "Conspiracy theories related to the Trump–Ukraine scandal")

Since the Independence of [Ukraine](/wiki/Ukraine "Ukraine")
 following the collapse of the [Soviet Union](/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union")
, Russia has had a history of running direct and active measures to undermine the sovereignty of Ukraine.[\[19\]](#cite_note-19)
 This included placing operatives in the government, influencing elections, and encouraging corruption.[\[20\]](#cite_note-20)
[\[21\]](#cite_note-21)
[\[22\]](#cite_note-22)

After the start of the [Russo-Ukrainian War](/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War "Russo-Ukrainian War")
, when Russia invaded Crimea and Eastern Ukraine, Russia began to take active measures to influence presidential elections in the [United States](/wiki/United_States "United States")
.[\[23\]](#cite_note-23)
[\[24\]](#cite_note-24)
 Beginning in 2014, this included efforts to discredit [Joe Biden](/wiki/Joe_Biden "Joe Biden")
.[\[25\]](#cite_note-Mayer-2019-25)

The series of false allegations about Joe Biden and Burisma[\[25\]](#cite_note-Mayer-2019-25)
 emerged at a convergence of interest between Russian efforts to help Trump's candidacy,[\[26\]](#cite_note-Bastos-2019-26)
 operatives and supporters of the Trump campaign,[\[27\]](#cite_note-27)
 and media in the United States.[\[28\]](#cite_note-28)
[\[29\]](#cite_note-29)

The thesis of the false conspiracy theory asserts that Joe Biden sought the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor to protect his son,[\[26\]](#cite_note-Bastos-2019-26)
 and that he did it in a _[quid pro quo](/wiki/Quid_pro_quo "Quid pro quo")
_ manner by trading loan guarantees for the personal favor. The FBI memorialized Smirnov's lies in an [FD-1023 form](/wiki/List_of_FBI_forms#FD-1023 "List of FBI forms")
, which read in part:

> Zlochevsky said he had a total of "17 recordings" involving the Bidens; two of the recordings included Joe Biden, and the remaining 15 recordings only included Hunter Biden. \[The informant\] reiterated that, per Zlochevsky, these recordings evidence Zlochevsky was somehow coerced into paying the Bidens to ensure Ukraine Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin was fired.[\[4\]](#cite_note-Prokop_9/28/2023-4)
> [\[34\]](#cite_note-34)

Smirnov also told the FBI that Zlochevsky said Burisma had hired Hunter Biden to "protect us, through his dad, from all kinds of problems."[\[35\]](#cite_note-Whitehurst_Mascaro_2/15/2024-35)

The FD-1023 came to the attention of the Republican-controlled [House Oversight Committee investigation of the Biden family](/wiki/United_States_House_Oversight_Committee_investigation_into_the_Biden_family "United States House Oversight Committee investigation into the Biden family")
 in 2023, leading to allegations of bribery that contributed to the Republican-controlled House voting to initiate impeachment proceedings against President Biden in December 2023. 2020 presidential elections.[\[48\]](#cite_note-Meduza-48)

#### Andrii Derkach

[Andrii Derkach](/wiki/Andrii_Derkach "Andrii Derkach")
 is a former Ukrainian politician, now stripped of citizenship,[\[50\]](#cite_note-50)
 who is believed to have been an agent or asset of Russia.[\[51\]](#cite_note-51)
 He played a central role in spreading falsehoods about Biden and Ukraine.[\[25\]](#cite_note-Mayer-2019-25)

Derkach released snippets of a supposed conversation between Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Poroshenko, in which Biden linked loan guarantees to the ouster of Viktor Shokin, the country's corrupt and ineffective prosecutor general.[\[5\]](#cite_note-Kessler-2020-5)
 The recordings, which were not verified as authentic and appeared to be heavily edited,[\[52\]](#cite_note-52)
 did not provide evidence to support the ongoing conspiracy theory that Biden wanted the prosecutor fired to protect his son.[\[53\]](#cite_note-53)
 In June 2020, Poroshenko denied that Joe Biden ever approached him about Burisma and characterized the recordings as fake.[\[54\]](#cite_note-Bertrand-2020-54)
[\[55\]](#cite_note-55)
 In September 2020, the [United States Department of the Treasury](/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury "United States Department of the Treasury")
 sanctioned Derkach, stating he "has been an active Russian agent for over a decade, maintaining close connections with the Russian Intelligence Services"."

A former FBI informant has pleaded guilty to lying about a supposed bribery scheme involving United States President Joe Biden and his son Hunter that was later used by Republicans in Congress as part of an [impeachment inquiry.](/economy/2024/12/10/two-presidents-two-sons-different-standards-of-outrage)

Alexander Smirnov entered his plea in Los Angeles federal court on Monday in response to a felony charge related to the phony story, along with a tax evasion charge stemming from a separate indictment accusing him of concealing millions of dollars of income.

Prosecutors and the defence have agreed to recommend a sentence of between four and six years in prison when he is sentenced next month.

Smirnov, 44, was [arrested in February](/news/2024/2/16/fbi-informant-charged-with-lying-in-bidens-ukraine-bribe-claims)
 on charges of making a “false statement” and “creating a false and fictitious record” to his FBI handler that executives from the Ukrainian energy company Burisma had paid President Biden and Hunter Biden $5m each around 2015.

Smirnov made the politically charged allegations in June 2020, after “expressing bias” about Joe Biden when he was running for president, prosecutors said.

In fact, Smirnov had only routine business dealings with Burisma starting in 2017, according to court documents.

The FBI found no evidence that Joe Biden acted corruptly or accepted bribes as US president or in his previous office as vice president.

While Smirnov’s identity wasn’t publicly known before the indictment, his claims played a major part in the Republican effort in Congress to investigate the president and his family, and helped spark a House impeachment inquiry into Biden.

Before Smirnov’s arrest, Republicans had demanded the FBI release the unredacted form documenting the unverified allegations, though they acknowledged they couldn’t confirm if they were true.

During a September 2023 conversation with investigators, Smirnov also claimed the Russians probably had recordings of [Hunter Biden](/news/2023/6/30/hunter-biden-the-us-presidents-scandal-plagued-son)
 because a hotel in Ukraine’s capital where he had stayed was “wired” and under their control — information he said was passed along to him by four high-level Russian officials.

But Hunter Biden had never travelled to Ukraine, according to Smirnov’s indictment.

Smirnov claimed to have contacts with Russian intelligence-affiliated officials, and told authorities after his arrest this year that “officials associated with Russian intelligence were involved in passing a story” about Hunter Biden.

“Despite repeated admonishments that he must provide truthful information to the FBI and that he must not fabricate evidence, the defendant provided false derogatory information” about the Bidens, prosecutors said in the indictment filed in federal court.

Hunter Biden was supposed to be sentenced this month after being convicted at a trial in a gun case and pleading guilty to federal charges in a separate tax case. But he was [pardoned this month](/news/2024/12/2/joe-biden-pardons-son-hunter-what-it-means-and-why-it-matters)
 by his father, who said he believed “raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice.”

Misinformation is often spread regarding Russia's war in Ukraine to sway public opinion about support for Kyiv and put pressure on western governments.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](https://static.euronews.com/website/images/logos/logo-euronews-stacked-outlined-72x72-grey-9.svg) ADVERTISEMENT

An image doing the rounds on social media allegedly shows a list of US politicians, including President Joe Biden, who have received bribes in return for support for Ukraine.

Text accompanying the list claims that a Ukrainian official released the names, as well as the amounts that each person has supposedly received.

Biden has allegedly received $92 million (€89.6 million), for example, while former speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi has taken home $86 million, and former senator Mitt Romney has received $71 million, according to the list.

The image, posted on the likes of Threads and X, shows a range of politicians across the US political divide.

Regardless, the claims are false — there's no evidence that any of the individuals mentioned have received any illicit payments from Ukraine in return for their pushing of support for Kyiv against the Russian invasion.

There are no legitimate news outlets reporting on the news, and it's also implausible that a Ukrainian official would release the statistics and incriminate the very politicians the country is relying on for financial aid.

The text accompanying the list tends to be badly written — another hallmark of untrustworthy news, especially as the mistakes are often the same, suggesting they're copied, pasted, and shared en masse.

Searching for earlier instances of the claims on X shows that it originates from at least as far back as 2023, and has been shared on various occasions since then.

Other fact-checkers from reputable news organisations debunked the claims at those times as well, and there's no reason to believe that the situation has changed since then.

Pro-Russian propaganda and other Ukraine detractors are often keen to spread false or misleading claims about support for Kyiv to sway public opinion and in turn, put pressure on western governments.

As of 30 September 2024, the US's Ukraine response funding totals nearly $183 billion since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, according to official Ukraine Oversight figures.

In Europe, as of January, the EU says it has made available more than $140 billion in financial, military, humanitarian and refugee assistance through its collective and individual member-state measures in the same period.

Washington is Ukraine's single biggest donor, yet as Donald Trump prepares to reenter the White House, European allies are concerned that the US could reduce or even stop providing aid altogether due to the president-elect's previous criticism of the amount the US sends.

The outgoing Biden administration is giving Ukraine as much military support as it can, including a $500 million weapons package aimed at putting Kyiv in the strongest possible position for potential negotiations to end the war. 

The defence ministers of Europe's five biggest military spenders — France, Germany, Italy, Poland and the UK — met near Warsaw on Monday to discuss maintaining support for Ukraine and enhancing domestic weapons production ahead of any shifts in US policy.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The BBC News article from July 21, 2023, discusses allegations that Joe Biden and his son accepted bribes from a Ukrainian firm, but there is no evidence to support this claim. The Wikipedia article discusses the Biden–Ukraine conspiracy theory, which alleges that Joe Biden took a bribe. A joint investigation found no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe Biden. The Al Jazeera article from December 16, 2024, reports that a former FBI informant pleaded guilty to lying about a bribery scheme involving Joe Biden and his son Hunter. The FBI found no evidence of corruption or bribes. <image:18>

### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/01/15/old-false-claims-resurface-about-ukrainian-kickbacks-to-us-politicians): 
Content: Euronews published an article on January 15, 2025, discussing the resurfacing of false claims about Ukrainian kickbacks to US politicians. The article states that an image circulating on social media lists US politicians, including Joe Biden, and alleges they received bribes from Ukraine. The article debunks these claims, stating there is no evidence to support them and that the claims have been debunked by other fact-checkers. The article mentions that the image has been circulating since at least 2023.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the claim is false. Multiple sources, including a Euronews article, debunk the allegations of US politicians receiving bribes from Ukraine, including the specific claim about Joe Biden. The image in the claim has been circulating since at least 2023, and there is no evidence to support the claims made in the image.


## Final Judgement
The claim is demonstrably false. There is no evidence to support the claim that the image is an authentic list released by Ukraine showing US politicians taking bribes. Multiple sources debunk the allegations, and the image has been circulating since at least 2023. `false`

## Summary

CNN  — 

Vice President JD Vance warned on Thursday that the United States could hit Russia with economic and military “tools of leverage” if Russian leader Vladimir Putin doesn’t negotiate a peace deal with Ukraine in good faith.

Speaking to the Wall Street Journal on Thursday, Vance said the option of sending US troops to Ukraine was “on the table,” as well as economic punishment if a peace deal doesn’t guarantee Kyiv’s long-term independence.

“There are economic tools of leverage, there are of course military tools of leverage,” Vance told the newspaper.

His comments strike a different tone from other recent statements from the White House – including from US President Donald Trump who [suggested this week](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/11/europe/ukraine-russia-trump-zelensky-intl/index.html)
 that Ukraine “may be Russian someday,” shortly before announcing that peace negotiations would begin immediately after holding a phone call with Putin.

Vance’s statement also contrasts with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who has said the US would no longer prioritize European and Ukrainian security. (AP Photo/Alex Babenko)\

The Wall Street Journal interview was published before Vance was set to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the high-level Munich Security Conference in Germany.

On arrival in Munich Vance said NATO remains an important alliance for the United States.

“Europe is of course a very important ally to the United States, NATO is a very important military alliance … but we want to make sure NATO is actually built for the future, and part of that is ensuring that NATO does a little bit more burden-sharing in Europe so the United States can focus on some of our challenges in East Asia,” Vance said, speaking to reporters beside NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte.

An air of uncertainty and anxiety that has enveloped Europe in the past week, after Trump’s announcement [sparked fears that a “dirty deal”](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/13/europe/europe-dirty-deal-trump-putin-ukraine-deal-intl/index.html)
 may be struck with Putin to end the war on terms favorable to Moscow without Kyiv’s involvement.

Many in Europe were shocked Trump appeared to make key concessions to Moscow before even agreeing to peace talks. [](#maincontent)

Volodymyr Zelenskyy, president of Ukraine speaks to the press during a media briefing on the territory of Khmelnytskyi Nuclear Power Plant, Ukraine, Thursday, Feb. This week, he told NATO allies that European and non-European troops – but not Americans – would have to police any agreement between Ukraine and Russia.

CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.

[![Volodymyr Zelenskyy, president of Ukraine speaks to the press during a media briefing on the territory of Khmelnytskyi Nuclear Power Plant, Ukraine, Thursday, Feb. His and Hegseth’s comments also threw into question the future of NATO’s future unity, resources and funding, a cornerstone of European security since the Second World War.

There was also surprise that Trump spoke to Putin before speaking to Zelensky, with European leaders on Thursday scrambling to make clear any peace deal would have to involve Ukraine at the heart of negotiations.

After Trump’s announcement of the peace deal negotiations, French President Emmanuel Macron also described his return to the White House as an “electroshock” for Europe in an interview with the Financial Times.

Macron underlined the need for Europe to strengthen its economy and defenses, agreeing with Trump’s stance that Ukraine’s security was a European responsibility. 13, 2025. 13, 2025. But he also emphasized that only Ukraine could negotiate for itself, and that any peace that was a “capitulation” would be bad news for everyone.

U.S. Vice President JD Vance visits Dachau Concentration Camp Memorial Site in Dachau, Germany February 13, 2025. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told [Ukraine's military allies](/world/europe/us-defense-chief-hegseth-says-return-ukraines-pre-2014-borders-not-realistic-2025-02-12/)
 in Brussels that a return to Ukraine's pre-2014 borders - before Russia annexed Crimea - was unrealistic and that the U.S. “He’s going to say, ‘Everything is on the table, let’s make a deal.’”

Vance also agreed that Trump might change his mind depending on how the negotiations unfold.

“President Trump could say, look, we don’t want this thing, we might not like this thing, but we’re willing to put it back on the table if the Russians aren’t being good negotiating partners, or there are things that are very important to Ukrainians that we might want to take off the table,” he said.

Feb 13 (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President JD Vance said the U.S. does not see NATO membership for Kyiv as part of a solution.

Ukrainians on Thursday worried that Trump was preparing to sell out their country following his phone call Putin.

Earlier in the day, Trump said that Ukraine would be involved in [peace talks with Russia](/world/eu-warns-against-dirty-deal-ukraine-after-trump-putin-phone-call-2025-02-13/)
. He told reporters at the White House that Ukraine would have a seat at the table during any peace negotiations with Russia over ending the war.

Kyiv said it would be premature to speak with Moscow at a security conference on Friday.

“I think there is a deal that is going to come out of this that’s going to shock a lot of people,” the newspaper quoted Vance as saying.

"The president is not going to go in this with blinders on,” Vance said."

[!Russia Notes US Hypocrisy in California Fire Case <image:4830>](/en/news/2025/01/12/3236714/russia-notes-us-hypocrisy-in-california-fire-case)

### TEHRAN (Tasnim) - Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova commented on reports that hundreds of prisoners have been mobilized to extinguish fires in the US state of California, pointing to the hypocrisy of the US.

[\- Other Media news -](/en/service/1200/other-media)

Earlier, The Washington Post, citing the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, reported that the state authorities had sent 395 prisoners to fight forest fires. The diplomat noted that in 2023, Washington restricted imports of products from several Chinese companies in an attempt to exclude goods allegedly produced with the help of Uygur forced labor from the US supply chain.

"This raises a logical question: will Congress draft a bill imposing sanctions on California authorities, private companies, and ordinary Americans for using prison labor to put out fires?" she wondered. "We are so sick of this hypocrisy!" Zakharova added.

Wildfires began to spread across Los Angeles County on January 7."

Did Russia offer sanctuary to California residents who lost their homes in the Los Angeles fires? A viral X [post](https://x.com/jacksonhinklle/status/1879042008465183185)
 by Jackson Hinkle—a [regular purveyor](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/11/business/media/jackson-hinkle-israel-gaza-misinformation.html)
 of Russia-related misinformation—claims so.

“BREAKING: RUSSIA has offered shelter & sanctuary to Californians whose livelihoods were DESTROYED in the LA wildfires,” reads the post, which had more than 500,000 views on X as of January 15. 

[Fact Check](https://thedispatch.com/category/fact-check/)

Assessing Claims That Russia Offered Sanctuary to California Fire Victims
=========================================================================

One Russian governor did make an offer, but there are some caveats.

! A single Russian governor said that he would welcome California fire victims to the region of occupied Ukraine he oversees, but only if they don’t support the government in Kyiv.

On Monday, Vladimir Saldo, the governor of the Russian-occupied Kherson oblast region of Ukraine, [told](https://tass.ru/obschestvo/22867057)
 _TASS_—a Russian state-controlled media outlet—that the region would accept any Americans who lost their homes in this month’s California fires. “Despite the ongoing, blatantly anti-Russian policy of the United States, we fully understand that natural disasters don’t care who you are or what you do,” Saldo said, [according to](https://www.rt.com/russia/610836-california-fires-sanctuary-kherson/)
 Russia Today, a Russian state-controlled network that translated the statement into English. Therefore, our region is ready to welcome any American citizen who has lost their home and livelihood.”

That offer comes with a caveat, applying only to Californians who haven’t supported Ukraine since Russia invaded its borders in February 2022. Sutton")

Other Russian Telegram channels are also spreading false or unverified narratives about the southern California fires and the government's response, as well as amplifying critiques from Americans including the president-elect's son, Donald Trump, Jr., Andy Carvin of the Atlantic Council's DFRLab told NPR in an email.

"Over the last week, Pravda has published at least 350 stories of this type \[based on Telegram messages about the fires\], based on our initial content analysis of the site," Carvin said.

 It remains unclear whether the arrest was due to actual crimes.[\[144\]](#cite_note-147)

Given names
-----------

East Slavic parents select a [given name](/wiki/Russian_personal_name "Russian personal name")
 for a newborn child. Most first names in East Slavic languages originate from two sources:

*   [Eastern Orthodox Church](/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church "Eastern Orthodox Church")
     tradition
*   [native pre-Christian Slavic lexicons](/wiki/Slavic_names "Slavic names")
    

Almost all first names are single. Doubled first names (as in, for example, [French](/wiki/French_name "French name")
, like _Jean-Luc_) are very rare and are from foreign influence. Most doubled first names are written with a hyphen: _Mariya-Tereza_.

### Forms

Being highly [synthetic languages](/wiki/Synthetic_languages "Synthetic languages")
, the East Slavic ones treat personal names as [grammatical](/wiki/Grammatical "Grammatical")
 nouns and apply the same rules of [inflection](/wiki/Inflection "Inflection")
 and [derivation](/wiki/Derivation_(linguistics) "Derivation (linguistics)")
 to them as for other nouns. So one can create many forms with different degrees of affection and familiarity by adding the corresponding suffixes to the auxiliary stem derived from the original name. The auxiliary stem may be identical to the word stem of the full name (the full name Жанна _Zhanna_ can have the suffixes added directly to the stem Жанн- _Zhann-_ like Жанн**очка** _Zhann**ochka**_), and most names have the auxiliary stem derived unproductively (the Russian name Михаил _Mikhail_ has the auxiliary stem Миш- _Mish-_, which produces such name-forms as Миш**а** _Mish**a**_, Миш**енька** _Mish**enka**_, Миш**уня** _Mish**unya**_ etc., not \***Михаил**ушка _**Mikhail**ushka_).

Unlike English, in which the use of diminutive forms is optional even between close friends, in East Slavonic languages, such forms are obligatory in certain contexts because of the strong [T–V distinction](/wiki/T%E2%80%93V_distinction "T–V distinction")
: the T-form of address usually requires the short form of the counterpart's name. Also, unlike other languages with prominent use of name suffixes, such as Japanese, the use of derived name forms is mostly limited to the T-addressing: there is no way to make the name more formal than the plain unsuffixed full form, and usually no suffixes can be added to the family name.

Most commonly, Russian philologists distinguish the following forms of given names:

| Name form | Example | Formation | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Full | _Анна_ (Anna) | full name stem + case ending | \-  |
| Short | _Ан**я**_ (An**ya**) | short name stem + II declension ending | most common for informal communication, comparable to Western name-only form of address _(Ann, John)_, or Japanese surname-only, or _surname/name -kun_ |
| Diminutive | _Ань**к**а_ (An**k**a) | short name stem + -к- _\-k-_ + II declension ending | expresses familiarity, may be considered rude when used between people who are not close friends. Comparable to English diminutives _(Annie, Willy)_ or Japanese unsuffixed names |
| Affective diminutive | _Ан**ечк**а_ (An**yechk**a) | short name stem + -ечк/очк/оньк/усь/юсь/уль/юль- _\-echk/ochk/on'k/us/yus/ul/yul-_ + II declension ending | most intimate and affectionate form, comparable to German diminutives _(Ännchen)_ or Japanese _\-chan_ suffixes |

#### Short forms

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Tsvetaeva.jpg/250px-Tsvetaeva.jpg)](/wiki/File:Tsvetaeva.jpg)

[Marina Tsvetaeva](/wiki/Marina_Tsvetaeva "Marina Tsvetaeva")
, a Russian poet. The name "Marina" traditionally has no short form.

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Nikolay_Ge_040.jpg/250px-Nikolay_Ge_040.jpg)](/wiki/File:Nikolay_Ge_040.jpg)

_Руслан_ (Ruslan), a character in [Alexander Pushkin](/wiki/Alexander_Pushkin "Alexander Pushkin")
's poem _[Ruslan and Ludmila](/wiki/Ruslan_and_Ludmila "Ruslan and Ludmila")
_. The short form for _Руслан_ (Ruslan) is _Руся_ (Rusya).

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Mikola_II.jpg/250px-Mikola_II.jpg)](/wiki/File:Mikola_II.jpg)

Николай II ([Nicholas II](/wiki/Nicholas_II "Nicholas II")
), the last Russian emperor. In private, [his wife](/wiki/Alexandra_Feodorovna_(Alix_of_Hesse) "Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)")
 addressed him as Nicki, in the German manner, rather than _Коля_ (Kolya), which is the East Slavic short form of his name.

The "short name" (Russian: краткое имя _kratkoye imya_), historically also "half-name" (Russian: полуимя _poluimya_), is the simplest and most common name derivative. Bearing no suffix, it is produced [suppletively](/wiki/Suppletion "Suppletion")
 and always has the declension noun ending for both males and females, thus making short forms of certain unisex names indistinguishable: for example, Sasha (Russian: Саша) is the short name for both the masculine name Aleksandr (Alexander) and the feminine form Aleksandra (Alexandra).

Some names, such as Zhanna (Jeana) and Mark, have no short forms; others may have two (or more) different forms. In the latter case, one form is usually more informal than the other.

#### Diminutive forms

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Veruschka_Gr%C3%A4fin_von_Lehndorff_001.jpg/250px-Veruschka_Gr%C3%A4fin_von_Lehndorff_001.jpg)](/wiki/File:Veruschka_Gr%C3%A4fin_von_Lehndorff_001.jpg)

[Veruschka](/wiki/Veruschka "Veruschka")
, a German model, actress and artist. "Veruschka" is the German spelling the [hypocoristic](/wiki/Hypocoristic "Hypocoristic")
 Верушка of her given name [Vera](/wiki/Vera_(given_name) "Vera (given name)")
.

Diminutive forms are produced from the "short name" by means of various suffixes; for example, Михаил Mikhail (full) – Миша Misha (short) – Мишенька Mishenka (affectionate) – Мишка Mishka (colloquial). If no "short name" exists, then diminutive forms are produced from the full form of the respective first name; for example, Марина Marina (full) – Мариночка Marinochka (affectionate) – Маринка Marinka (colloquial). Unlike the full name, a diminutive name carries a particular emotional attitude and may be unacceptable in certain contexts. Depending on the nature of the attitude, diminutive name forms can be subdivided into three broad groups: affectionate, familiar, and slang.

##### Affectionate diminutive

Typically formed by suffixes -_еньк_\- (-yenk-), -_оньк_\- (-onk-), -_ечк_\- (-yechk-), -_ушк_ (-ushk), as illustrated by the examples below. It generally emphasises a tender, affectionate attitude and is roughly analogous to German suffixes -_chen_, -_lein_, Japanese -_chan_ and -_tan_ and affectionate name-derived nicknames in other languages. It is often used to address children or intimate friends.

Within a more official context, this form may be combined with the honorific plural to address a younger female colleague.\[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")\

| Ольга/Olga | Оля/Olya | Оленька/Olyenka |
| Степан/Stepan | Стёпа/Styopa | Стёпочка/Styopochka |

##### Colloquial diminutives

Colloquial diminutives are derived from short names by the -_к_\- ("-k-") suffix. Expressing a highly familiar attitude, the use may be considered rude or even pejorative outside a friendly context.

\], _Real Lads_). Kolyan shows viewers the ridiculous side of the life of [gopniks](/wiki/Gopnik "Gopnik")
, a subculture similar to British [chavs](/wiki/Chav "Chav")
.

Slang forms exist for male names and, since a few decades ago, female names. They are formed with the suffixes -_ян_ (-yan), -_он_ (-on), and -_ок/ёк_ (-ok/yok). The suffixes give the sense of "male brotherhood" that was once expressed by the patronymic-only form of address in the Soviet Union.

The patronymic name is based on the given name of the father and is written in all legal and identity documents. If used with the given name, the patronymic always follows it; but it is not analogous to an English [middle name](/wiki/Middle_name "Middle name")
.

### Usage

The patronymic name is obligatory when addressing a person of higher social stance and/or on special occasions such as business meetings; for example, when a pupil addresses a teacher, they are obliged to use both first and patronymic names – [Russian](/wiki/Russian_language "Russian language")
: Марья Ивановна, могу я спросить..., [lit.](/wiki/Literal_translation "Literal translation") 'Marya Ivanovna, may I ask...'. Not using patronymic names in such situations is considered offensive.[\[2\]](#cite_note-3)

Addressing a person by patronymic name only is widespread among older generations and serves as a display of close relationship based on not only sympathy but also mutual responsibility.[\[3\]](#cite_note-4)

In speech patronymics are commonly truncated and it is not considered to be a colloquialism, e.g., written "Ivan Ivanovich" may be pronounced "as is", as well as "Ivan Ivanych".[\[4\]](#cite_note-5)
[\[5\]](#cite_note-6)

In the past of [East Slavs](/wiki/East_Slavs "East Slavs")
, before the introduction of surnames, noble, wealthy, or otherwise respected people were addressed by name plus patronymic, see, e.g., "[Yaroslavich](/wiki/Yaroslavich "Yaroslavich")
"/"[Yaroslavna](/wiki/Yaroslavna "Yaroslavna")
". From this custom a number of surnames of [West Ruthenian](/wiki/Ruthenians "Ruthenians")
 origin was produced, such as [Antonovich](/wiki/Antonovich "Antonovich")
 or [Prokopovich](/wiki/Prokopovich "Prokopovich")
, which in their turn derived [Polish surnames](/wiki/Polish_surnames "Polish surnames")
, such as [Antonowicz](/wiki/Antonowicz "Antonowicz")
 or [Prokopowicz](/wiki/Prokopowicz "Prokopowicz")
 (the Ruthenian origin is recognized by the suffix _\-wicz_: the corresponding native (now archaic) Polish suffix was '-wic': [Szymonowic](/wiki/Szymonowic "Szymonowic")
, [Klonowic](/wiki/Klonowic "Klonowic")
).[\[6\]](#cite_note-7)

For commoners, when the distinction among people with the same given name was required, a qualifier "son of..." was usually added: "Ивашка, Антонов сын" ("Ivashka, Antonov syn", i.e., 'Ivashka, son of Anton'). From the latter tradition Russian [patronymic surnames](/wiki/Patronymic_surname "Patronymic surname")
 ending in "-ov/-ev/yov" originated, in this case, [Antonov](/wiki/Antonov_(surname) "Antonov (surname)")
".

### Derivation

| Name | Masculine patronym | Feminine patronym |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Anatoly | Anatolyevich | Anatolyevna |
| Constantin | Constantinovich | Constantinovna |
| Dmitry | Dmitriyevich | Dmitriyevna |
| Ilya | Ilyich | Ilyinichna |
| Ivan | Ivanovich | Ivanovna |
| Nikolay | Nikolayevich | Nikolayevna |
| Vladimir | Vladimirovich | Vladimirovna |
| Yakov | Yakovlevich | Yakovlevna |

The patronymic is formed by a combination of the father's name and suffixes. The suffix is -_ович_ (-ovich) for a son, -_овна_ (-ovna) – for a daughter. For example, if the father's name was _Иван_ (Ivan), the patronymic will be _Иванович_ (Ivanovich) for a son and _Ивановна_ (Ivanovna) for a daughter.

If the suffix is being appended to a name ending in a _й_ ("y") or a soft [consonant](/wiki/Consonant "Consonant")
, the initial _o_ in the suffixes -_ович_ (-ovich) and -_овна_ (-ovna) becomes a _е_ ("ye") and the suffixes change to -_евич_ (-yevich) and -_евна_ (-yevna). For example, if the father is _Дмитрий_ (Dmitry), the patronymic is _Дмитриевич_ (Dmitrievich) for a son and _Дмитриевна_ (Dmitrievna) for a daughter. It is not _Дмитрович_ (Dmitrovich) or _Дмитровна_ (Dmitrovna) because the name _Дмитрий_ (Dmitry) ends on "й" ("y");

For some names ending in a [vowel](/wiki/Vowel "Vowel")
, the suffix is -_ич_ (-ich) for a son and -_ична_ (-ichna) or -_инична_ (-inichna) for a daughter; for example, Фока Foka (father's first name) – Фокич Fokich (male patronymic) – Фокична Fokichna (female patronymic); Кузьма Kuzma (father's first name) – Кузьмич Kuzmich (male patronymic) – Кузьминична Kuzminichna (female patronymic).

### Historical grounds

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Rurikname.JPG/250px-Rurikname.JPG)](/wiki/File:Rurikname.JPG)

The name [Rurik](/wiki/Rurik "Rurik")
 on a [Viking Age](/wiki/Viking_Age "Viking Age")
 runestone. All the princes of [Kievan Rus](/wiki/Kievan_Rus "Kievan Rus")
 had the patronymic [Ruerikovichi](/wiki/Rurikids "Rurikids")
.

Historical Russian naming conventions did not include surnames. A person's name included that of their father: e.g. _Иван Петров сын_ (Ivan Petrov syn) which means "Ivan, son of Peter". That is the origin of most Russian -ov surnames.

Modern -ovich- patronyms were originally a feature of the royal dynasty (Рюрико**вич**и, [Rueriko**vich**i, Rurikids](/wiki/Rurik_dynasty "Rurik dynasty")
, which makes the East Slavic patronym in its original meaning being similar to German _von_. From the 17th century, the second name with suffix -_ович_ (-_ovich_) was the privilege given by the [tsar](/wiki/Tsar "Tsar")
 to commoners. For example, in 1610, Tsar [Vasili IV](/wiki/Vasili_IV_of_Russia "Vasili IV of Russia")
 gave to the [Stroganovs](/wiki/Stroganov_family "Stroganov family")
, who were merchants, the privilege to use patronyms. As a tribute for developing the salt industry in Siberia, Pyotr Stroganov and all his issues were allowed to have a name with -_ovich_. The tsar wrote in the chart dated on 29 May, "... _to write him with_ ovich_, to try_ \[him\] _in Moscow only, not to fee_ \[him\] _by other fees, not to kiss a cross by himself_ \[which means not to swear during any processions\]"[\[7\]](#cite_note-8)
 In the 18th century, it was the family of merchants to have patronyms. By the 19th century, the -ovich form eventually became the default form of a patronymic.

### Legal basis

Everyone in Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus is supposed to have a tripartite name. Single mothers may give their children any patronym, and this does not have any legal consequences. Foreigners who adopt Russian citizenship are exempted from having a patronym. Now, an adult person is entitled to change patronyms if necessary,[\[8\]](#cite_note-9)
 such as to alienate themselves from the biological father (or to show respect for the adopted one) as well as to decide the same for an underage child.

### Matronymic

In modern Russia, there are cases when women raising a child without a father give the child their own name instead of a patronymic. This practice is not recognized by law, but the civil registry offices may meet such wishes. A common loophole is when mother's name is a feminine form of a masculine given name, even an obscure one.[\[9\]](#cite_note-10)
[\[10\]](#cite_note-11)

Family names
------------

[Family names](/wiki/Family_name "Family name")
 are generally used like in English.

In Russian, some common suffixes are -_ов_ (-ov), -_ев_ (-yev), meaning "belonging to" or "of the clan of/descendant of", e.g. Petrov = of the clan of/descendant of Petr (Peter), usually used for [patronymic surnames](/wiki/Patronymic_surname "Patronymic surname")
—or -_ский_ (-sky), an adjectival form, meaning "associated with" and usually used for [toponymic surnames](/wiki/Toponymic_surname "Toponymic surname")
. Historically, toponymic surnames may have been granted as a token of nobility; for example, the princely surname [Shuysky](/wiki/Shuysky "Shuysky")
 is indicative of the princedom based on the ownership of [Shuya](/wiki/Shuya_(inhabited_locality) "Shuya (inhabited locality)")
. Prince [Grigory Aleksandrovich Potemkin](/wiki/Grigory_Potemkin "Grigory Potemkin")
\-Tavricheski had the [victory title](/wiki/Victory_title "Victory title")
 'Tavricheski', as part of his surname, granted to him for the [annexation of Crimea by the Russian Empire](/wiki/Annexation_of_Crimea_by_the_Russian_Empire "Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Empire")
.

In the 19th and early 20th centuries, _\-off_ was a common transliteration of _\-ov_ for Russian family names in foreign languages such as French and German (like for the [Smirnoff](/wiki/Smirnoff "Smirnoff")
 and the [Davidoff](/wiki/Davidoff "Davidoff")
 brands).

Surnames of Ukrainian and Belarusian origin use the suffixes -ко (-ko), -ук (-uk), and -ич (-ych). For example, the family name _Писаренко_ ([Pisarenko](/wiki/Pisarenko "Pisarenko")
) is derived from the word for a scribe, and _Ковальчук_ ([Kovalchuk](/wiki/Kovalchuk "Kovalchuk")
) refers to a smith.

Less often, some versions of family names will have no suffix, e.g. Lebed, meaning swan, and Zhuk, meaning beetle (but see also Lebedev and Zhukov).

[Hyphenated surnames](/wiki/Hyphenated_surname "Hyphenated surname")
 like [Petrov-Vodkin](/wiki/Petrov-Vodkin "Petrov-Vodkin")
 are possible.

### Grammar

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Lesser_CoA_of_the_emperor_of_Russia.svg/250px-Lesser_CoA_of_the_emperor_of_Russia.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Lesser_CoA_of_the_emperor_of_Russia.svg)

The Coat of Arms of the _Романовы_ ([Romanovs](/wiki/Romanovs "Romanovs")
), the last Russian royal dynasty. The family name _Романов_ (Romanov) means "pertaining to (the name) Roman".

East Slavic languages are [synthetic languages](/wiki/Synthetic_languages "Synthetic languages")
 and have [grammatical cases](/wiki/Grammatical_cases "Grammatical cases")
 and [grammatical gender](/wiki/Grammatical_gender "Grammatical gender")
. Unlike [analytic languages](/wiki/Analytic_language "Analytic language")
 like English, which use prepositions ("to", "at", "on" etc.) to show the links and relations between words in a sentence, East Slavic suffixes are used much more broadly than prepositions. Words need the help of some suffix to integrate them into the sentence and to build a grammatically correct sentence. That includes names, unlike in German. Family names are declined based on the Slavic case system.

The surnames that originally are short (_\-ov_, _\-ev_, _\-in_) or full (_\-iy/-oy/-yy_) Slavic adjectives, have different forms depending on gender: male forms _\-ov_, _\-ev_, _\-in_ and _\-iy/-oy/-yy_ correspond to female forms _\-ova_, _\-eva_, _\-ina_ and _\-aya_, respectively. For example, the wife of _Борис Ельцин_ (Boris Yel'tsin) was _Наина Ельцин**а**_ (Naina Yel'tsin**a**); the wife of [Leo Tolst**oy**](/wiki/Leo_Tolstoy "Leo Tolstoy")
 was [Sophia Tolst**aya**](/wiki/Sophia_Tolstaya "Sophia Tolstaya")
, etc. All other, i.e. non-adjectival, surnames stay the same for both genders (including surnames ending with -_енко_ (_\-yenko_), -_ич_ (_\-ich_) etc.), unlike in many [West Slavic languages](/wiki/West_Slavic_languages "West Slavic languages")
, where the non-adjectival surname of men corresponds to derivative feminine adjectival surname (Novák → Nováková). Note the difference between patronymics and surnames ending with _\-ich_: surnames are the same for males and females, but patronymics are gender-dependent (for example, Ivan Petrov_ich_ Mirov_ich_ and Anna Petr_ovna_ Mirov_ich_)

This dependence of [grammatical gender](/wiki/Grammatical_gender "Grammatical gender")
 of adjectival surname on the gender of its owner is not considered to be changing the surname (compare the equivalent rule in [Polish](/wiki/Polish_name "Polish name")
, for example). The correct transliteration of such feminine surnames in English is debated: the names technically should be in their original form, but they sometimes appear in the masculine form.

The example of _Иванов_ (Ivanov), a family name, will be used:

| Grammatical  <br>case | Example of question | Masculine form |     | Feminine form |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cyrillic | Latin | Cyrillic | Latin |
| [Nominative](/wiki/Nominative_case "Nominative case") | Who? | _Иванов_ | Ivanov | _Иванова_ | Ivanova |
| [Genitive](/wiki/Genitive_case "Genitive case") | Whose? | _Ивано**ва**_ | Ivano**va** | _Ивано**вой**_ | Ivano**voy** |
| [Dative](/wiki/Dative_case "Dative case") | To whom? | _Ивано**ву**_ | Ivano**vu** | _Ивано**вой**_ | Ivano**voy** |
| [Accusative](/wiki/Accusative_case "Accusative case") | Whom? | _Ивано**ва**_ | Ivano**va** | _Ивано**ву**_ | Ivano**vu** |
| [Instrumental](/wiki/Instrumental_case "Instrumental case") | By whom? | _Ивано**вым**_ | Ivano**vym** | _Ивано**вой**_ | Ivano**voy** |
| [Locative](/wiki/Locative_case "Locative case")<br> (Prepositional) | About whom? | _Ивано**ве**_ | Ivano**ve** | _Ивано**вой**_ | Ivano**voy** |

The surnames which are not grammatically adjectives (_Zhuk_, _Gogol_, _Barchuk_, _Kupala_ etc.) declines in cases and numbers as the corresponding common noun. The exclusion is when a woman has a surname which is grammatically a noun of masculine gender; in such case, the surname is not declined. For example, Ivan and Anna Zhuk in dative case ("to whom?") would be: Иван**у** Жук**у** (_Ivan**u**_ _Zhuk**u**_), but Анн**е** Жук (_Ann**e** Zhuk_).

Family names are generally inherited from one's parents. As in English, on marriage, women usually adopt the surname of the husband; the opposite, when the husband adopt the maiden surname of his wife, very rarely occurs. Rarely, both spouses keep their pre-marriage family names. The fourth, very rare but still legal way is the taking a double surname; for example, in marriage of Ivanov (he) and Petrovskaya (she), the spouses may adopt the family name Ivanov-Petrovsky and Ivanova-Petrovskaya, correspondingly.

Slavicisation of foreign names
------------------------------

### Slavicisation of foreign surnames

See also: [Azerbaijanization of surnames](/wiki/Azerbaijanization_of_surnames "Azerbaijanization of surnames")

Some surnames in those languages have been [russified](/wiki/Russification "Russification")
 since the 19th century: the surname of Kazakh former [president](/wiki/President_(government_title) "President (government title)")
 [Nursultan Nazarbayev](/wiki/Nursultan_Nazarbayev "Nursultan Nazarbayev")
 has a Russian "-yev" [suffix](/wiki/Suffix "Suffix")
, which literally means "of Nazar-bay" (in which "bay" is a Turkic native [noble](/wiki/Nobility "Nobility")
 [rank](/wiki/Ranks_of_nobility_and_peerage "Ranks of nobility and peerage")
: compare [Turkish](/wiki/Turkish_people "Turkish people")
 "[bey](/wiki/Bey "Bey")
", [Uzbek](/wiki/Uzbeks "Uzbeks")
 "boy" "bek", and [Kyrghyz](/wiki/Kyrgyz_people "Kyrgyz people")
 "bek"). The frequency of such russification varies greatly by country.

After incorporation of [Azerbaijan](/wiki/Azerbaijan "Azerbaijan")
 into the [Soviet Union](/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union")
, it became obligatory to register their surnames and to add a Russian suffix such as _\-yev_ or _\-ov_ for men and _\-yeva_ or _\-ova_ for women.[\[11\]](#cite_note-12)
 Since the majority did not have official surnames, the problem was resolved by adopting the name of the father and adding the mentioned suffixes. Examples are [Aliyev](/wiki/Aliyev "Aliyev")
, [Huseynov](/wiki/Huseynov "Huseynov")
, and [Mammadov](/wiki/Mammadov "Mammadov")
.

Since 1930s and 1940s, surnames and patronymics were obligatory in [Uzbekistan](/wiki/Uzbekistan "Uzbekistan")
.[\[12\]](#cite_note-13)
 The surname could be derived from the name of the father by adding the suffixes -ev after vowels or soft consonants and -ov in all other cases. Examples are [Rashidov](/wiki/Rashidov "Rashidov")
, [Beknazarov](/wiki/Beknazarov "Beknazarov")
 and [Abdullaev](/wiki/Abdullaev "Abdullaev")
. Most of the people born in this time had the same surname as their patronymic.

### Slavicisation of foreign patronymics

By law, foreign persons who adopt [Russian citizenship](/wiki/Russian_citizenship "Russian citizenship")
 are allowed to have no patronymic.[\[13\]](#cite_note-14)
 Some adopt non-Slavonic patronymics as well. For example, the Russian politician [Irina Hakamada](/wiki/Irina_Hakamada "Irina Hakamada")
's patronym is _Муцуовна_ (Mutsuovna) because her [Japanese](/wiki/Japanese_name "Japanese name")
 father's given name was Mutsuo. The ethnicity of origin generally remains recognizable in Russified names. Other examples are [Kazakh](/wiki/Kazakh_language "Kazakh language")
 _ұлы_ (_uly_; transcribed into Latin script as _\-uly_, as in [Nursultan Abish**uly** Nazarbayev](/wiki/Nursultan_Nazarbayev "Nursultan Nazarbayev")
), or [Azeri](/wiki/Patronymic#Azeri "Patronymic")
 _оглы/оғлу_ (_oglu_) (as in [Heydar Alirza **oglu** Aliyev](/wiki/Heydar_Aliyev "Heydar Aliyev")
); Kazakh _қызы_ (transcribed into Latin script as -_qyzy_, as in [Dariga Nursultan**qyzy** Nazarbayeva](/wiki/Dariga_Nazarbayeva "Dariga Nazarbayeva")
).\[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")\
_\] Such Turkic patronymics were officially allowed in the Soviet Union.\[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")\
_\]

[Bruno Pontecorvo](/wiki/Bruno_Pontecorvo "Bruno Pontecorvo")
, after he emigrated to the Soviet Union, was known as _Бруно Максимович Понтекорво_ (Bruno Maximovich Pontekorvo) in the Russian scientific community, as his father's given name was _Massimo_ (corresponding to Russian Максим (Maksim)). His sons have been known by names _Джиль Брунович Понтекорво_ (Gigl Brunovich Pontecorvo), _Антонио Брунович Понтекорво_ (Antonio Brunovich Pontecorvo) and _Тито Брунович Понтекорво_ (Tito Brunovich Pontekorvo).

Forms of address
----------------

### Common rules

*   For informal communication, only the first name is used: Иван Ivan. Even more informally, [diminutives](/wiki/Diminutives "Diminutives")
     (several can be formed from one name) are often used.
*   In rural areas, the patronymic name alone (_Петрович_ Petrovich, _Ивановна_ Ivanovna) is used by old people among themselves, but young people sometimes use the form for irony. Also, younger people can use the form for much older people for both respect and informality. For example, a much younger man with a very good relationship with his elder colleague may use a patronymic and the "ty" form, but using the first name alone is generally inappropriate. Using a diminutive (like in most informal communication) would nearly always be very impolite.
*   The family name alone (_Петров_, Petrov) is used, much more rarely, in formal communications. It is commonly used by school teachers to address their students. Informally, Russians are starting to call people by their surnames alone for irony.
*   the form "first name + patronymic" (for instance, _Иван Иванович_, Ivan Ivanovich):
    *   is the feature of official communication (for instance, students in schools and universities call their teachers in the form of "first name + patronymic" only);
    *   may convey the speaker's respect for the recipient. Historically, patronymics were reserved for the royal dynasty (Рюрико**вич**и, [Rueriko**vich**i](/wiki/Rurikovich "Rurikovich")
        )
*   The full three-name form (for instance, _Иван Иванович Петров_ Ivan Ivanovich Petrov) is used mostly for official documents. With some exceptions, everyone in Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus is supposed to have a three-part name. This form is also used on formal occasions and for introducing oneself to a person who is likely to write down the full name, like a police officer. The family name is placed first (_Петров Иван Иванович_, Petrov Ivan Ivanovich) in various documents, when sorting by personal name is important.

Historically, [diminutives](/wiki/Diminutive "Diminutive")
 of the given names were used in reference to commoners, to indicate an their low status: [Stenka Razin](/wiki/Stenka_Razin "Stenka Razin")
, [Grishka Rasputin](/wiki/Grishka_Rasputin "Grishka Rasputin")
, etc. A diminutive could be used by persons of a higher class when referring to themselves to indicate humility, e.g., when addressing to the [tsar](/wiki/Tsar "Tsar")
.

The choice of addressing format is closely linked to the [choice of second-person pronoun](/wiki/T%E2%80%93V_distinction#Russian "T–V distinction")
. Russian language distinguishes:

*   formal _вы_ (vy, "you"); respectful _Вы_ ("Vy", "You") may be capitalized in formal correspondence, but plural _вы_ ("vy", "you") is not.
*   informal _ты_ (ty, "you", "thou" in old English);

_Вы_ ("Vy") is the plural of both forms to address a pair or group. Historically, it comes from German, under [Peter the Great](/wiki/Peter_the_Great "Peter the Great")
, which uses [_du_ and _Sie_](/wiki/T%E2%80%93V_distinction#Sie_and_du "T–V distinction")
 similarly.\[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")\
_\]

Other than the use of patronymics, Russian forms of address in Russian are very similar to English ones.

Also, the meaning of the form of address strongly depends on the choice of a V-T form:

| Vy or ty | Form | Male example | Female example | Use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Using "Vy" | Full three-name form | Anatoliy Pavlovich Ivanov | Varvara Mikhailovna Kuznetsova | Official documents, very formal occasions (when necessary) |
| First name + patronymic | Anatoliy Pavlovich | Varvara Mikhailovna | General formal or respectful form |
| Surname | Ivanov | Kuznetsova | Formal. Often used by a person of a higher social position (like a teacher talking to a student) |
| Informal first name + informal patronymic | Tol' Palych | Varvara Mikhalna | Respectful but less formal |
| Full first name | Anatoliy | Varvara |
| Diminutive first name | Tolya | Varya | Friendly but still somewhat formal |
| Affectionate first name |     | Varechka | Used almost exclusively towards women, showing fondness but still keeping some formality (like to a younger colleague) |
| Using "Ty" | First name + patronymic | Anatoliy Pavlovich | Varvara Mikhailovna | Can be used between friends on semi-formal occasions or ironically |
| Informal patronymic | Palych | Mikhalna | Combining familiarity and respect |
| Surname | Ivanov | Kuznetsova | Similar in use to a "vy" form but less formal |
| Full first name | Anatoliy | Varvara | Friendly but with a tone of formality. If the name has no diminutive form (Yegor), also used informally |
| Diminutive first name | Tolia | Varya | General informal form |
| Colloquial first name | Tolik | Var'ka | Very familiar form |
| Slang first name | Tolyan | Varyukha |
| Affectionate first name | Tolen'ka | Varechka | Tender, affectionate form |

Using a "ty" form with a person who dislikes it or on inappropriate occasions can be an insult, especially the surname alone.

### Adjectives

Other East Slavic languages use the same adjectives of their literal translation if they differ from Russian analogue. All East Slavic languages are synthetic languages, and grammatical genders are used. Thus, the suffix of an adjective changes with the sex of the recipient.

In Russian, adjectives before names are generally restricted to written forms of communication. Adjectives like _Любимый / Любимая_ (lyubimiy / lyubimaya, "beloved") and _Милый / Милая_ (miliy / milaya, "sweetheart") are informal, and _Уважаемый / Уважаемая_ (uvazhayemiy / uvazhayemaya, literally "respected") is highly formal. Some adjectives, like _Дорогой / Дорогая_ (dorogoy / dorogaya, "dear"), can be used in both formal and informal letters.

Russian passport expiry date:

*   from 14 years old – until reaching the age of 20;
*   from 20 years – until reaching the age of 45;

**Russian passport machine-readable entry**
-------------------------------------------

Russian domestic passport has special rules and method of forming a machine-readable entry. The machine-readable record contains the surname, name, patronymic, date of birth (year, month, day) of the passport holder, sex of the passport holder, series and number of the passport, code of the migration department issuing the passport, date of issue of the passport, as well as the type of document, state issuing the passport, citizenship of the passport holder.

A machine-readable entry consists of two lines of 44 characters each. The machine-readable entry area is located in the opposite fold of the bottom quarter of the third page of the passport.

A machine-readable entry is entered into the passport with a special printer using the font OCR-B type 1 (Стандарт ИСО 1073/П).

To fill in the positions of characters 6–44 of the top line of a machine-readable record, the “modernized clair” information coding method is used, in which the letters of the Russian alphabet correspond to certain letters of the Latin alphabet and Arabic numbers:

There is a data structure of the upper and lower machine-readable lines.

**Russian internal passport number format**
-------------------------------------------

These details will tell you how to read a Passport series and number Russian. The series and passport number are recorded in the format XX XX YYYYYY, where XX XX is the 4-digit passport series and YYYYYY is the 6-digit passport number.

Now you know how many digits does a Russian passport have

![numbers in russia internal passport series number and id number](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20600%20137'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Russian passport number example

The first two digits of the passport series correspond to the OKATO code of the region in which the passport was issued; the third and fourth digits of the passport series correspond to the last two digits of the year of issue of the passport form (deviation of 1-3 years is allowed).

What is a series and passport number of a citizen of the Russian Federation? This is an original 10-digit numeric combination. Without looking closely, you can see that there is a small gap between the first four digits and the next six, which distinguishes the series from the number. The first four numerical values are a series of the document, and the remaining six are its number.

If you look closely, the first 4 digits are also pairwise separated from each other, for example, 52 17. The first pair number allows you to find out in which area the citizen received his document.

The digital code in the document allows you to distinguish one document from another. A single surname and name would not be enough, since many people with the same surname, name and date of birth can live in the Russian Federation.

In such a situation, only a given numerical code helps to distinguish one citizen from another. After all, the chance that two citizens have a numerical code will be identical is zero.

If you enter these values in a special database, then the result will be all the information about the person (his name, information about marriage, children, etc.).

**Russian passport number sample**
----------------------------------

Passport number Russia

![Russia passport number sample](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20400%2087'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Russia passport number

Example Russian passport serial number: a passport of a series 45 04 was issued in the city of Moscow, and a passport of a series 37 11 was issued in the Kurgan region in 2011.

For example, if the beginning of the ten-digit code contains the number 52, this means that the document was received in the Nizhny Novgorod region. After the first two-digit number follows the second, which means the year of issue.

From example 52-17 it can be understood that the passport was issued in 2017.

Attention! Sometimes the second number does not coincide with the year of issue, that is, instead of 17 it may be 16 or 18. There is an explanation for this.

This can happen when the issued forms for 2017 ended, and in the passport office began to use forms for the next, 2018. Or vice versa, the year 2016 has passed, and the forms remained on it.

Therefore, if the second two-digit number does not coincide with the year of issue, there is nothing criminal in it.

![Russian passport ID number](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20450%20607'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Russian passport ID number

![Russia passport number](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20450%20318'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Russian passport number format

The photo shows the second and third pages of the passport of a person who is a citizen of Russia. On the right vertically along the entire length of the pages of the document, a series and a number are printed in red font. Russian passport ID number

The first numerical value, consisting of 2 digits – 39, means the area in which the citizen received the document. In the situation presented in the photo above, the document was issued in the Kaliningrad region.

Let’s look at another example with a different arrangement of partially original code of Russian passport series and number.

![Russian passport series and number](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20450%20636'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Russian passport series and number

On the page on the lower right, you can clearly see numbers from small punctures. Everything is similar here, only spaces between numerical values are less noticeable than in the first example.

The last six digits are the serial number in the state database.

Based on this, we can conclude that the first 4 digits of many citizens of the Russian Federation can be identical. But the next six digits of all people are absolutely unique.

The image of the Russian passport (<image:21>) appears on the Wikipedia article "East Slavic name" ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Slavic_name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Slavic_name)) and on a website about Russian internal passports ([https://ukrainian-passport.com/blog/internal-russian-passport/](https://ukrainian-passport.com/blog/internal-russian-passport/)). The image also appears on Wikimedia Commons ([https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Pasport_RF.jpg](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Pasport_RF.jpg)), which shows a Russian passport.


## Elaboration
The claim that the image shows an authentic Russian passport of Bashar al-Assad is false. The AOL article ([https://www.aol.com/fact-check-assad-passport-image-140122086.html](https://www.aol.com/fact-check-assad-passport-image-140122086.html)) states that the image is photoshopped. The reverse image search confirms that the passport image is a real Russian passport, but the image has been altered.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that the image is a manipulated version of a real Russian passport. The AOL fact-check explicitly states the image is photoshopped. Therefore, the claim is not accurate. `false`

From [Source](https://www.russiamatters.org/blog/russias-economy-collapsing): 
Content: "For one, the [IMF](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2025/01/17/world-economic-outlook-update-january-2025)
 and [World Bank](https://thedocs.worldbank.org/en/doc/c50bc3c87bc2666b9e5fa6699b0b2849-0050012025/related/GEP-Jan-2025-Analysis-ECA.pdf)
 estimate that the Russian economy grew by 3.8% and 3.4%, respectively, in 2024.3 Looking ahead, both expect the Russian economy to continue growing in 2025–2026, even though this growth is expected to slow down. The same year saw 19 new Russian dollar billionaires join Forbes’s ranking, which is the highest number of new dollar billionaires Russia has produced since 2011, according to [Re: Russia](https://re-russia.net/en/analytics/0233/)
.

As the economy grew in 2024, so did Russia’s budget revenues, even though this growth was not sufficient to eliminate the aforementioned budget deficit. Olga Chyzh of the University of Toronto also took a dim view of the Russian economy in her recent commentary for The Guardian, entitled “A string of assassinations, a [faltering economy](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/dec/19/russia-assassinations-economy-workers-putin)
, a shortage of workers: the pressure on Putin is ratcheting up.” In this Dec. 2024, commentary, Chyzh writes that Russia’s “economy is faltering under the combined strain of the war and Western sanctions.” “War-driven salary increases … have triggered a vicious cycle of inflation and subsequent interest-rate hikes. Writing in The Hill in October 2024, he predicts that a “Russian economic meltdown is coming next year.” “Leonid Brezhnev’s Soviet Union should have taught Putin a lesson,” warns Motyl, who has repeatedly predicted [Russia’s collapse](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=Alexander+Motyl+Russia+collapse)
. 5, 2024, entitled “[The collapse of the Russian economy](https://www.counteroffensive.news/p/the-collapse-of-the-russian-economy)
,” on American journalist Tim Mak’s Substack, “Counteroffensive.” The Kyiv-based Euromaidan Press outlet then published a commentary by [Yurii Bohdanov](https://euromaidanpress.com/author/yuriybohdanov/ "View all posts by Yurii Bohdanov")
 on Jan. 17, 2025, in which he claims that “even ‘freezing’ the war in Ukraine will not solve Russia’s economic problems… and a freeze only delays the inevitable collapse.” 

### Russia Doesn’t Have a Clean Bill of Health

Some of the aforementioned criticism of what the [IMF](https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/PPPSH@WEO/OEMDC/ADVEC/WEOWORLD)
 ranks as the world’s 4th largest economy in terms of PPP is valid. In fact, Russia’s budget revenues in December 2024 reached more than 4 trillion rubles ($40 billion), up by 28% compared to December 2023, the highest level recorded in ministry data beginning from January 2011, according to [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-21/russia-s-budget-revenue-surges-to-record-in-december-despite-sanctions "(opens in a new window)")
.5 One sector of the Russian economy which provides much of the money6 that is accumulated in the Russian budget and that the Kremlin then spends on its war, is the energy sector. Gazprom, the national gas champion, is estimated to have lost more [than $3 billion](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/gazprom-reports-9-month-loss-32-billion-2024-10-29/)
 in the first nine months of 2024, for instance.)

### Conclusion 

No economy is completely healthy, and Russia’s is, by far, no exception, particularly given Western sanctions and its rampant spending on the military-industrial complex and the war against Ukraine.

Is Russia’s Economy Collapsing?
===============================

February 06, 2025

[Simon Saradzhyan](/authors/simon-saradzhyan)

The past few months have seen a number of Russia watchers echo each other’s proclamations that the Russian economy is either already collapsing or close to crumbling. 

Will these predictions materialize?

"The rise in growth reflects a substantial fiscal stimulus, strong investment, and resilient consumption in the context of a tight labour market," the IMF said on Tuesday in its World Economic Outlook, in reference to this year's forecast.

Russia's economy ministry expects gross domestic product (GDP) to expand 2.8% this year, bouncing back from a 2.1% decline in 2022. In its July outlook, the IMF had forecast 1.5% growth.

But the IMF lowered its forecast from 1.3% for 2024, giving Russia the weakest projections in its list of major emerging market and developing economies, for whom average growth this year and next is seen at 4%.

Russia's economy ministry forecasts 2.3% growth next year, while the Bank of Russia's forecast range is 0.5-1.5%.

Oct 10 (Reuters) - Russia's economy will grow by 1.1% in 2024, slower than previously forecast, the International Monetary Fund said, after significant spending and resilient consumption in a stretched labour market support growth of 2.2% this year.

Moscow plans to [allocate](/world/europe/everything-front-russia-allots-third-2024-spending-defence-2023-10-02/)
 almost a third of increased budget spending next year to defence as it diverts more resources towards its invasion of Ukraine. The IMF said Western sanctions on Russian crude oil exports have had mixed effects, with Russian oil now trading above the $60 price cap imposed by the Group of Seven nations.

But Russians likely face double-digit interest rates until at least 2025 and the rouble [tumbled](/markets/currencies/russian-rouble-tumbles-over-18-month-low-vs-dollar-2023-10-09/)
 to over 18-month lows this week on foreign currency outflows. Labour is scarce, with unemployment at record lows, something Putin and the central bank have drawn attention to.

High military spending may help Russia in the short-term, but the economy's long-term prospects are bleak, [economists](/markets/europe/russian-economy-holding-up-road-back-prosperity-may-be-long-2023-02-23/)
 have said, especially as areas like schools and healthcare face effective spending freezes in the years ahead.

### Evidence from `web_search`
The IMF website provides information about Russia, including its membership date, quota, and Special Drawing Rights, and includes a link to the July 2025 World Economic Outlook Update, which projects a 0.9% change in real GDP for 2025 (<image:2695>).

Arthur Novosiltsev / Moskva News Agency

The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday boosted its 2024 growth forecast for Russia, with surging government spending on the war continuing to provide a powerful economic stimulus for the country.

The IMF also slashed its outlook for Ukraine, whose economy and infrastructure have been battered by two and a half years of conflict. Both Russia and Ukraine are spending huge sums to continue fighting in the war, with Moscow's state expenditures having helped the economy grow strongly despite a barrage of Western sanctions.

According to its latest forecast, the IMF said it expects the Russian economy to expand by 3.6% in 2024, up from a previous forecast of 3.2%. But it also cut its prediction for next year's growth from 1.5% to 1.3% amid signs of mounting economic problems.

Russia's Central Bank has repeatedly warned of the dangers of the government's military spending, saying the economy has been “overheating” for months. High inflation — 8.6% in September — and intense labor shortages are also posing economic headaches for Moscow.

In a rare move, President Vladimir Putin acknowledged earlier this month that Russia's record low unemployment of 2.4% was a “limiting factor” for the country's growth prospects.

Russia's Central Bank has raised interest rates to 19% in a bid to bring inflation under control, and it could increase them again at a meeting this coming Friday.

Russia's Finance Ministry, meanwhile, proposed raising military spending next year by almost 30% to around $145 billion, with combined defense and security spending set to account for approximately 40% of state expenditures.

The Developments in Russia Despite the pressure of unprecedented sanctions, the Russian economy continues to show consistently high growth rates, systematically surpassing most forecasts, including those of the IMF. INTERNATIONAL MONETARY AND FINANCIAL COMMITTEE Fiftieth Meeting October 24–25, 2024 Statement No. Amid complex challenges and numerous risks facing the global economy, the IMF should enhance the effectiveness of its bilateral and multilateral surveillance, assist member countries in strengthening institutional capacities, and continue to refine its lending toolkit. The IMF should fully adhere to its mandate and fulfill its obligations to member countries, as outlined in the Articles of Agreement, to further promote equitable international cooperation for the economic development of all countries. The global public debt-to- GDP ratio continues to rise: it grew from 92.8 percent in 2023 to 93.5 percent in 2024 and is expected to further increase to 94.8 percent in 2025. 2 Geoeconomic fragmentation is increasingly diminishing the efficiency of the global economy. Russia continues to pursue responsible fiscal policy and maintains macroeconomic stability. Fiscal policy priorities remain focused on fulfilling all social obligations to the population and enhancing Russia’s defense capacity and technological self-sufficiency. Despite external constraints, by the end of this year, Russia's public debt will be less than 15 percent of GDP and will remain at a safe level in the upcoming three-year period."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that the IMF boosted its 2024 growth forecast for Russia in October 2024. The IMF held a meeting on October 24-25, 2024, where the Russian Minister of Finance stated that the Russian economy showed high growth rates.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The IMF website provides information about Russia, including its membership date, quota, and Special Drawing Rights, and includes a link to the July 2025 World Economic Outlook Update, which projects a 0.9% change in real GDP for 2025 (<image:2695>). The IMF ranks Russia as the world's 4th largest economy in terms of PPP.

The article from russiamatters.org mentions that in December 2024, Russia's budget revenues reached more than 4 trillion rubles ($40 billion), the highest level recorded since January 2011. The article was published on February 06, 2025.

GDP comparisons using PPP are arguably more useful than those using [nominal GDP](/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal) "List of countries by GDP (nominal)")
 when assessing the domestic market of a state because PPP takes into account the relative cost of local goods, services and inflation rates of the country, rather than using international market exchange rates, which may distort the real differences in per capita income.[\[3\]](#cite_note-ICP-3)
 For example, while the nominal GDP ranks of Germany and India are third and fourth respectively, when adjusted for PPP Germany's GDP drops to sixth and India rises to third because the local cost of goods in India is lower, and thus same nominal amount of money can buy more goods and services in India.

GDP adjusted for PPP, however, is limited when measuring financial flows between countries and when comparing the quality of same goods among countries.[\[4\]](#cite_note-CallenIMF-4)
 PPP is often used to gauge global [poverty thresholds](/wiki/Poverty_threshold "Poverty threshold")
 and is used by the [United Nations](/wiki/United_Nations "United Nations")
 in constructing the [Human Development Index](/wiki/Human_Development_Index "Human Development Index")

 These surveys such as the International Comparison Program include both tradable and non-tradable goods in an attempt to estimate a representative basket of all goods.[\[3\]](#cite_note-ICP-3)

!IMF ranks Russia as world’s fourth-largest economy by purchasing power <image:9400>

**Russia just clinched fourth place on the global economic ladder, based on purchasing power parity (PPP), in new data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).**

This makes Russia one of the top contributors to global economic growth, moving ahead of several Western economies. PPP adjusts for price differences across countries, giving more weight to nations with large populations and lower costs of living.

With this [ranking](https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2024/10/24/tr102424-transcript-of-eur-reo)
, Russia now joins China, the U.S., and India in the top four, adding muscle to the economic power of BRICS. This year alone, they’ve met twice, once in Beijing and once at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Kazakhstan.

Putin is also working closely with India, maintaining New Delhi as a strategic ally from the Cold War era despite Russia’s tight relations with India’s rival, China.

Western allies have tried to get Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to press Moscow on Ukraine, but he has avoided criticizing [Russia](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/russian-crypto-queen-stole-for-ukraine-army/)
, focusing instead on peace and his seemingly close friendship with Putin.

by CryptoPolitan Over the next five years, the IMF sees China, India, Russia, and Brazil driving growth far more than the Group of Seven (G7), which includes the U.S., Germany, and Japan.

G7 countries, known for their strong GDPs, are now expected to contribute less, with BRICS economies filling in the gap.

### BRICS outpaces G7

Among the BRICS, China is expected to lead the charge, contributing 22% of global growth through 2029 — more than all G7 countries combined.

### BRICS outpaces G7

Among the BRICS, China is expected to lead the charge, contributing 22% of global growth through 2029 — more than all G7 countries combined. In its latest forecasts, the IMF emphasized a future where emerging markets are the heavy lifters.

Unlike prior projections, which leaned on the West, this one points straight to BRICS."

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the IMF boosted its 2024 growth forecast for Russia in October 2024. The IMF held a meeting on October 24-25, 2024, where the Russian Minister of Finance stated that the Russian economy showed high growth rates. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the IMF declared Russia the fourth-largest economy in the world in October 2024.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified.
