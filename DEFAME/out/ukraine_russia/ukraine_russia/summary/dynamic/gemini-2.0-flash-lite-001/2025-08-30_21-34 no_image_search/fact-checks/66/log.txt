Useful result: From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_invasion_of_Manchuria): 
Content: The Soviet Union invaded the Empire of Japan's puppet state of Manchukuo on August 9, 1945, as part of World War II. The invasion, also known as Operation August Storm, caught the Japanese by surprise. The Kwantung Army, the main Japanese force in the area, was unprepared. The Soviets employed a large-scale pincer movement. The 2nd Far Eastern Front's objectives were Harbin and Qiqihar, and to prevent Japanese forces from withdrawing. The Japanese forces were overwhelmed, and many were taken prisoner and sent to labor camps in Siberia. The invasion resulted in significant casualties and the collapse of Japanese control in the region.

The claim 'China and Japan plan to invade the Russian Federation.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. The search results reveal that the Soviet Union invaded Manchukuo, a puppet state of Japan, in 1945 ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_invasion_of_Manchuria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_invasion_of_Manchuria)), and that Russia has plans to target sites in Japan ([https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3293037/russias-uncovered-secret-war-plans-target-160-sites-japan-and-south-korea](https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3293037/russias-uncovered-secret-war-plans-target-160-sites-japan-and-south-korea)). However, there is no evidence of a planned invasion of Russia by China or Japan.

So, the overall veracity is: false
