### Evidence from `web_search`
The Atlantic Council reports that the Houthis have shot down US MQ-9 Reaper drones, using Iranian weapon systems or technology. The Houthis claimed to have shot down a US MQ-9 Reaper in Yemen on December 28, 2024, and another in 2025. The Houthis have claimed responsibility for downing fourteen MQ-9 Reaper drones since November 2023. Iran mediated talks between Russia and the Houthis that led to Moscow supplying Russian-made advanced anti-ship cruise missiles to the group.

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the Houthis have shot down US MQ-9 Reaper drones in Yemen. The Atlantic Council reports that the Houthis used Iranian weapon systems or technology. NPR and CNN confirm that the Houthis have shot down US Reaper drones. The image's location is most likely in Israel.

The claim states that the image shows a US drone shot down by the Houthis using Russian missiles. The evidence does not confirm the use of Russian missiles. The evidence does not confirm the location of the image.

Therefore, the claim is partially accurate. The claim is accurate in that the Houthis have shot down US drones. However, the claim is not accurate in that the image shows a drone shot down by the Houthis using Russian missiles. The location of the image is also not confirmed.


## Final Judgement
The Houthis have shot down US drones, but the evidence does not confirm the use of Russian missiles or the location of the image. The claim is therefore partially inaccurate. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is partially inaccurate. While the Houthis have shot down US drones, the evidence does not confirm the use of Russian missiles or the location of the image. The Atlantic Council reports that the Houthis used Iranian weapon systems or technology to down the drones, and NPR and CNN confirm that the Houthis have shot down US Reaper drones.
