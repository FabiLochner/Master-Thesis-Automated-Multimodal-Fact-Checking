Content: The search result from Notes from Poland, published on January 16, 2025, discusses accusations of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy interfering in the Polish presidential election in favor of the government candidate. <image:1>, <image:2>, <image:3>. Polish opposition figures criticized Zelenskyy for apparent criticism of a presidential candidate and for presenting an award to the main ruling party's candidate during his visit to Warsaw. They accused him of "brazen interference" in the campaign for the May presidential election.

The claim 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy engaged in election interference by campaigning in Pennsylvania for Kamala Harris ahead of the US presidential election in 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is **false**. While Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited a munitions factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania, which was perceived by some as a form of election interference, there is no direct evidence that he campaigned for Kamala Harris. The accusations are based on the perception of the visit and criticisms from Republicans, not on explicit campaigning.

So, the overall veracity is: false
