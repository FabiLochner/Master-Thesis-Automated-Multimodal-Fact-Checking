, his draft law "On amendments to some laws of Ukraine in connection with the change of the electoral system for the election of people's deputies" proposed to hold the election with closed lists because the 60-day term to the snap election did not "leave any chances for the introduction of this system."[\[115\]](#cite_note-UPclosedlistsrejected-119)

 at the [COP26 climate summit](/wiki/United_Nations_Climate_Change_conference "United Nations Climate Change conference")
 in Glasgow, November 2021

Zelenskyy opposed targeting the Russian language in Ukraine and banning artists for their political opinions (such as those viewed by the Government as [anti-Ukrainian](/wiki/Anti-Ukrainian_sentiment "Anti-Ukrainian sentiment")
).[\[350\]](#cite_note-354)
[\[351\]](#cite_note-355)
 In April 2019, he stated that he was not against a [Ukrainian language](/wiki/Ukrainian_language "Ukrainian language")
 quota ([on radio and TV](/wiki/Ukrainization#Mass_media "Ukrainization")
), although he noted they could be tweaked.[\[352\]](#cite_note-/7212672/_Zelensky-356)
 He also said that Russian artists "who have turned into (anti-Ukrainian) politicians" should remain banned from entering Ukraine.[\[339\]](#cite_note-3daysbUpeZi-343)

In response to a petition demanding equal rights for same-sex couples, Zelenskyy affirmed that democracies were measured by how they ensure equal rights for all citizens, that "all people are free and equal in their dignity and rights",[\[353\]](#cite_note-LGBTNYT-357)
 and that the family "consists of persons who live together, are connected by common life, have mutual rights and obligations";[\[354\]](#cite_note-lgbtcnn-358)
 he asked the [Prime Minister of Ukraine](/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Ukraine "Prime Minister of Ukraine")
 to review [civil partnerships](/wiki/Civil_union "Civil union")
 for same-sex couples and called this "part of the work on establishing and ensuring human rights and freedoms".[\[354\]](#cite_note-lgbtcnn-358)
 However, he said that [same-sex marriage](/wiki/Same-sex_marriage "Same-sex marriage")
 could not be introduced during wartime as this would require amending the Constitution of Ukraine, which defines marriage as "based on the free consent of a woman and a man", and the Constitution cannot be changed during martial law.[\[353\]](#cite_note-LGBTNYT-357)
[\[355\]](#cite_note-359)
[\[356\]](#cite_note-blade-360)
 Civil rights organizations such as [Kyiv Pride](/wiki/Kyiv_Pride "Kyiv Pride")

 though [Holos](/wiki/Holos_(political_party) "Holos (political party)")
 MP [Inna Sovsun](/wiki/Inna_Sovsun "Inna Sovsun")
 criticised the lack of details about legal proposals for civil partnerships.[\[353\]](#cite_note-LGBTNYT-357)

On 2 December 2022, Zelenskyy said his administration would enter a bill in the Verkhovna Rada that would ban "religious organizations affiliated with centers of influence in the Russian Federation", referring to the [Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate)](/wiki/Ukrainian_Orthodox_Church_(Moscow_Patriarchate) "Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate)")
 (UOC-MP), from operating in Ukraine.[\[357\]](#cite_note-361)
 The bill was passed by parliament and signed by Zelenskyy in August 2024,[\[358\]](#cite_note-uocmp-362)
 after opposition parties protested the bill's delay.[\[359\]](#cite_note-uocmpdelay-363)
 The law treats each parish individually and gives it nine months to cut ties with the UOC-MP, following which a special commission will inspect individual parishes and file lawsuits against non-compliant ones; the court can then decide on a ban in each case.[\[360\]](#cite_note-uocmpexplain-364)

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.britannica.com/event/2022-Russian-invasion-of-Ukraine):

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.cirsd.org/en/horizons/horizons-summer-2022-issue-no.21/the-causes-and-consequences-of-the-ukraine-war): 
Content: The article from cirsd.org discusses the causes of the 2022 Ukraine war. It mentions that Putin invaded Ukraine on February 24th, 2022. It also mentions the US and its allies' efforts to bring Ukraine into NATO, which Russia saw as a threat. The article also mentions that the "taproot of the crisis is the American-led effort to make Ukraine a Western bulwark on Russia’s borders." The author also mentions that Putin emphasized that Russia accepts “the new geopolitical reality that took shape after the dissolution of the USSR.”

Useful result: From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine): 
Content: The Russian invasion of Ukraine began on February 24, 2022, escalating a conflict that started in 2014. The invasion followed Russia's build-up of troops near Ukraine's borders and demands to the West, including a ban on Ukraine joining NATO. The invasion was announced by Vladimir Putin, who stated it was to support the Russian-backed breakaway republics of Donetsk and Luhansk. The conflict has resulted in significant casualties, a refugee crisis, and global repercussions, including a world food crisis and disruptions to climate policy. The article also mentions the annexation of Crimea in 2014, which was preceded by the invasion of Russian soldiers. <image:i>. The Minsk agreements, aimed at resolving the conflict, failed.

The claim 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy started the 2022 war in Ukraine with Russia.' is false.
Justification: The claim that Volodymyr Zelenskyy started the 2022 war in Ukraine is demonstrably false. Multiple sources, including a Britannica article ([https://www.britannica.com/event/2022-Russian-invasion-of-Ukraine](https://www.britannica.com/event/2022-Russian-invasion-of-Ukraine)) and an Al Jazeera article ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/20/fact-check-did-ukraine-start-its-war-with-russia-as-trump-claims](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/20/fact-check-did-ukraine-start-its-war-with-russia-as-trump-claims)), indicate that the full-scale invasion was initiated by Russia on February 24, 2022, and that the conflict has its origins in 2014.

So, the overall veracity is: false
