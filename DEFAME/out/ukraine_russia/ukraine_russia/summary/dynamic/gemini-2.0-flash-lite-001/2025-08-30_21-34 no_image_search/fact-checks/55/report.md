## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Several news outlets, including the BBC ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0m12wl0jwpo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0m12wl0jwpo)) and The Hollywood Reporter ([https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/politics-news/fake-online-usaid-paid-hollywood-stars-debunked-1236129713/](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/politics-news/fake-online-usaid-paid-hollywood-stars-debunked-1236129713/)), debunked a video alleging USAID paid Hollywood celebrities to visit Ukraine. The BBC identified the video as a Russian disinformation campaign. The video named Angelina Jolie, Sean Penn, Jean Claude Van Damme, Orlando Bloom, and Ben Stiller as recipients of the alleged payments.

Ben Stiller denied the claims, stating he self-funded his trip, which was confirmed by the UNHCR. Vanity Fair ([https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/ben-stiller-denies-elon-musks-retweet-claiming-usaid-funded-the-stars-trip-to-ukraine?srsltid=AfmBOooGw1dpqnug2OYCP6ztL_oyb-nbLtgTwlK9XIbCoPDkIdmO6uAz](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/ben-stiller-denies-elon-musks-retweet-claiming-usaid-funded-the-stars-trip-to-ukraine?srsltid=AfmBOooGw1dpqnug2OYCP6ztL_oyb-nbLtgTwlK9XIbCoPDkIdmO6uAz)) also reported on the video, which was fabricated. The Hollywood Reporter noted the video falsely cited "eonline.com" as a source, which was dismissed by E! News-parent NBCUniversal.

The video was identified as a Russian disinformation campaign.

Furthermore, The Hollywood Reporter noted that the video falsely cited "eonline.com" as a source, which was dismissed by E! News-parent NBCUniversal. Ben Stiller denied the claims, stating he self-funded his trip.
