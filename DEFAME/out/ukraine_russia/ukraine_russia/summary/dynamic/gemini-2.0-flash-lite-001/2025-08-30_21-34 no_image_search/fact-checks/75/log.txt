Useful result: From [Source](https://www.newsweek.com/russia-protests-american-soldiers-kursk-1942273): 
Content: Newsweek reports that Russia has claimed the presence of American mercenaries in the Kursk region during Ukraine's incursion in August 2024. <image:3404>, <image:3401>, <image:3403>. The Russian Foreign Ministry expressed strong protest to the U.S. and stated that those involved would be considered legitimate military targets. Experts interviewed by Newsweek suggest that even if American PMCs were present, it wouldn't necessarily mean the U.S. government directed the raid. The article was published on August 20, 2024.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/russia-ukraine-war/russia-formally-protests-us-mercenaries-joining-ukrainian-soldiers-in-kursk-region-/3308755): 
Content: The Anadolu Agency published an article on August 20, 2024, stating that Russia protested the participation of US private military companies (PMCs) fighting alongside Ukraine in the Kursk region. <image:k> The Russian Foreign Ministry claimed that US mercenaries were fighting alongside Ukrainian troops in the Kursk region. The article mentions an incursion into the Kursk region that began on the night of August 5-6.

The claim '<image:24> This image shows American mercenaries participating in Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024.' is false.
Justification: The image provided in the claim is from September 2022 and depicts events in the Kharkiv region, not the Kursk Oblast in August 2024, as the claim suggests. While there are reports of Russian protests regarding the presence of American mercenaries in the Kursk region in August 2024 ([Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/russia-protests-american-soldiers-kursk-1942273), [Anadolu Agency](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/russia-ukraine-war/russia-formally-protests-us-mercenaries-joining-ukrainian-soldiers-in-kursk-region-/3308755)), the image itself does not support this claim.

So, the overall veracity is: false
