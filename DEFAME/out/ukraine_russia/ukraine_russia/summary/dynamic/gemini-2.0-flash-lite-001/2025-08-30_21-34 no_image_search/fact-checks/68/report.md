## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The article from ACEC.org discusses the Senate committee assignments for the 119th Congress and mentions that Adam Schiff (D-CA) was assigned to the Finance Committee (![image 2574](media/2025-08-07_20-48-1754599702-705995.jpg) and ![image 1](media/0.jpg)). The document from Torreydc.com lists the Senate Committee Assignments for the 119th Congress, with John Thune as a member of the Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee, the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, and the Finance Committee. Adam Schiff is listed as a member of the Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee, the Environment and Public Works Committee, the Judiciary Committee, and the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee.

The document from Holland & Knight LLP lists the committee assignments for the House of Representatives and the Senate for the 118th Congress. Adam Schiff is listed as a member of the House Committee on the Judiciary, and John Thune is listed as a member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Adam Schiff was assigned to several committees, including the Finance Committee in the 119th Congress. John Thune was also a member of the Finance Committee. However, the evidence does not mention John Thune blocking Adam Schiff's committee assignments. The evidence also does not explicitly link any committee assignments to Schiff's work in the Russia investigation.

The provided evidence does not support the claim that John Thune blocked Adam Schiff's committee assignments.

More information is needed to verify the claim, such as statements from John Thune or other sources explaining the reasons behind committee assignments.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The CNN article ([https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/24/politics/mccarthy-democrats-schiff-swalwell-intelligence-committee](https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/24/politics/mccarthy-democrats-schiff-swalwell-intelligence-committee)) and the NPR article ([https://www.npr.org/2023/01/25/1151335616/mccarthy-democrats-schiff-swalwell-intelligence-committee-assignments](https://www.npr.org/2023/01/25/1151335616/mccarthy-democrats-schiff-swalwell-intelligence-committee-assignments)) report that House Speaker Kevin McCarthy blocked Adam Schiff from the House Intelligence Committee. Schiff attributed this to "political vengeance" for his role in investigations and impeachments of former President Donald Trump. The PBS article ([https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/republican-led-house-poised-to-censure-schiff-over-trump-russia-investigations](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/republican-led-house-poised-to-censure-schiff-over-trump-russia-investigations)) also mentions that Republicans blocked Schiff from the intelligence panel. ![image 1](media/0.jpg)

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Kevin McCarthy, not John Thune, blocked Adam Schiff from the House Intelligence Committee. Schiff himself attributed this to political reasons related to his past work.

The claim is inaccurate because it incorrectly identifies John Thune as the person who blocked Schiff's committee assignments.


## Final Judgement
The initial search results did not provide information to support the claim. Subsequent searches revealed that Kevin McCarthy, not John Thune, blocked Adam Schiff from a committee assignment. This action was attributed to Schiff's past work.

The claim is demonstrably false because it misidentifies the person who blocked Adam Schiff's committee assignments. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. Evidence from multiple news sources, including CNN and NPR, indicates that House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, not John Thune, blocked Adam Schiff from the House Intelligence Committee. Schiff attributed this action to political motivations related to his past work.
