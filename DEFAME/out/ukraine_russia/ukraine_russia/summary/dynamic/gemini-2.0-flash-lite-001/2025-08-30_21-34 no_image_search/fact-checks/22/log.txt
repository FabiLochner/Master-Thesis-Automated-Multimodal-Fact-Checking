Useful result: From [Source](https://understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-january-19-2025): 
Content: The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) published a report on January 19, 2025, stating that the Ukrainian General Staff reported that Russian forces used ammunition equipped with chemical agents banned by the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) 434 times in Ukraine in December 2024, contributing to a total of 5,389 documented cases since February 2023. The report also mentions the Kursk Oblast and the Russian offensive campaign. <image:9046>

The claim '<image:12> This image shows a chemical attack by the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the Kursk offensive in August 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not supported by the evidence. While the image's location is uncertain, the search results confirm the Kursk offensive occurred in August 2024. However, there is no evidence to confirm that the image depicts a chemical attack by the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the Kursk offensive. The provided sources discuss the offensive and the use of chemical weapons, but they do not include the image or link it to a chemical attack.

So, the overall veracity is: false
