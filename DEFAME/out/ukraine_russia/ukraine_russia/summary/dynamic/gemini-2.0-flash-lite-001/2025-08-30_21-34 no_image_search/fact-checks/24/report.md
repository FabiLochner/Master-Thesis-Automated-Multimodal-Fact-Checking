## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Howard Buffett, not Warren Buffett, has donated significant funds to Ukraine. Specifically, Howard Buffett's foundation has provided substantial aid, with Business Insider reporting $520 million in humanitarian aid as of February 24, 2024. Other sources state that Howard Buffett's foundation has provided $800 million in aid and funding, aiming to surpass $1 billion this year.

Therefore, the claim is inaccurate because it attributes the donations to Warren Buffett, while the evidence clearly points to Howard Buffett's foundation as the source of the aid.


## Final Judgement
The evidence shows that Howard Buffett, not Warren Buffett, has donated over $500 million to Ukraine. Multiple sources confirm Howard Buffett's foundation has provided significant aid, with figures exceeding the claimed amount.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE
