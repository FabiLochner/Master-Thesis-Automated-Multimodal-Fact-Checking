## Evidence

The World Economic Forum published an article about Volodymyr Zelenskyy's address at the Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland, in January 2024. ![image 10](media/13.jpg)

### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Klaus Schwab at the World Economic Forum in Davos on January 22, 2020 (![image 10](media/13.jpg)). The image is from the website of the President of Ukraine and is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

The image was found on the following websites: [Source](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ukraine_President_Volodymyr_Zelenskyy_and_Klaus_Schwab_at_the_World_Economic_Forum_in_Davos,_22_January_2020.jpg), [Source](https://scn.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ukraine_President_Volodymyr_Zelenskyy_and_Klaus_Schwab_at_the_World_Economic_Forum_in_Davos,_22_January_2020.jpg), and [Source](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ukraine_President_Volodymyr_Zelenskyy_and_Klaus_Schwab_at_the_World_Economic_Forum_in_Davos,_22_January_2020.jpg).


## Elaboration
The image depicts Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Klaus Schwab at the World Economic Forum in Davos on January 22, 2020. This predates the large-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, which began in February 2022. Therefore, the claim is inaccurate.


## Final Judgement
The image shows Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Klaus Schwab at the World Economic Forum in Davos on January 22, 2020, which is before the large-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine. The claim states that the image was taken after the invasion.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image shows Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Klaus Schwab at the World Economic Forum in Davos on January 22, 2020, as confirmed by a reverse image search ([Source](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ukraine_President_Volodymyr_Zelenskyy_and_Klaus_Schwab_at_the_World_Economic_Forum_in_Davos,_22_January_2020.jpg)). This date precedes the large-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, making the claim inaccurate.
