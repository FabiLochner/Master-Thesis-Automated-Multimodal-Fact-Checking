## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image in the claim (![image 22](media/73.jpg)) is of an F-16 fighter jet that crashed near March Air Reserve Base in May 2019. The crash was caused by a hydraulic failure due to improperly installed parts. The pilot ejected and survived. The image appears in articles from The Press-Enterprise ([https://www.pressenterprise.com/2020/05/01/heres-why-the-missiles-on-the-crashed-f-16-near-march-air-reserve-base-did-not-explode/](https://www.pressenterprise.com/2020/05/01/heres-why-the-missiles-on-the-crashed-f-16-near-march-air-reserve-base-did-not-explode/)), Air & Space Forces Magazine ([https://www.airandspaceforces.com/improperly-installed-parts-caused-f-16-to-crash-into-warehouse-in-may-2019/](https://www.airandspaceforces.com/improperly-installed-parts-caused-f-16-to-crash-into-warehouse-in-may-2019/)), and The Sun ([https://www.sbsun.com/2020/04/23/hydraulic-failure-caused-f-16-to-crash-near-march-base-last-year-air-force-says/](https://www.sbsun.com/2020/04/23/hydraulic-failure-caused-f-16-to-crash-near-march-base-last-year-air-force-says/)). The image in the articles is the same as the image in the claim (![image 2710](media/2025-08-07_21-02-1754600543-161834.jpg), ![image 2711](media/2025-08-07_21-02-1754600552-420945.jpg)).
