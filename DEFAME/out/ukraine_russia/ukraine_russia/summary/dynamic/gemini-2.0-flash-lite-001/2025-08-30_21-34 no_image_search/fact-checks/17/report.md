## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Myth Detector fact-checked the claim that Volodymyr Zelenskyy purchased an 88 million euro hotel in Courchevel, France, and found it to be false. The information originated from anonymous Russian-language accounts and a questionable French-language media outlet. The hotel was purchased in 2023 by the Monegasque company Société des Bains de Mer (SBM) (![image 1861](media/2025-08-07_19-11-1754593914-756508.jpg), ![image 1862](media/2025-08-07_19-12-1754593941-308493.jpg)).

Ukrinform.net reported that Russian media falsely claimed Zelenskyy purchased the Palace des Neiges hotel in Courchevel, France, for 88 million euros, originating from a fabricated video and a cloned website (![image 1868](media/2025-08-07_19-12-1754593974-239582.jpg), ![image 1870](media/2025-08-07_19-12-1754593976-768408.jpg), ![image 1873](media/2025-08-07_19-13-1754593980-370998.jpg)). UNN news also reported that the Center for Countering Disinformation recorded the spread of this fake news in France, stating that the reports are untrue (<image:k>).


## Elaboration
The claim is false. The evidence indicates that the information originated from anonymous Russian-language accounts and a questionable French-language media outlet. The hotel was purchased by the Monegasque company Société des Bains de Mer (SBM).


## Final Judgement
The claim that Volodymyr Zelenskyy purchased an 88 million euro hotel in Courchevel, France, is false. Multiple sources, including fact-checking organizations and news outlets, have debunked this claim, citing that the hotel was purchased by a different entity and that the information originated from unreliable sources.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. Fact-checks by the Myth Detector and reports from Ukrinform.net and UNN news, indicate that the information originated from unreliable sources and that the hotel was purchased by the Société des Bains de Mer (SBM), not Volodymyr Zelenskyy.
