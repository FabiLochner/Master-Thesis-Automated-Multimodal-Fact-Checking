Content: The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and the International Committee of the Red Cross published a report on the Russia-Ukraine international armed conflict. The report mentions the involvement of 58 National Societies, including the Russian Red Cross Society and the Red Cross Society of China. The Ukrainian Red Cross Society is at the forefront of the response in Ukraine. <image:k>

The claim '<image:6> This image shows the Chinese Communist Party's Red Cross troops in Russia who have changed into winter clothes and set off for the Russian-Ukrainian front to aid Russia in rescuing its occupied territories.' is false.
Justification: The image in the claim is of an airliner, not Chinese Red Cross troops. While there is evidence of Chinese involvement in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the claim's assertion about the image cannot be confirmed.

So, the overall veracity is: false
