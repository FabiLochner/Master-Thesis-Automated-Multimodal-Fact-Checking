## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (![image 26](media/78.jpg)) of destroyed tanks appears in multiple sources. One source, from Sputnik Africa, published on October 17, 2024, reports that Ukraine has lost around 40 Leopard tanks since February 2022. Another source, The Moscow Times, published on June 13, 2023, states that Russia captured German Leopard tanks in the Zaporizhzhia region.

A third source, Defence Security Asia, published on May 19, 2024, discusses the destruction of German-made Leopard tanks in Ukraine and mentions that the Russian military claimed to have destroyed five Leopard 2A1 tanks between May 11 and 17, 2024. None of the sources mention Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024.


### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results discuss the 2024 Kursk offensive, which began on August 6, 2024, as part of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The Armed Forces of Ukraine launched an incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast. The article mentions the involvement of Ukrainian brigades, Russian forces, and North Korean forces. The article also mentions the number of casualties and equipment losses. The article includes a timeline of the campaign and mentions the capture of settlements and the destruction of bridges. The article also mentions the involvement of the 80th and 82nd Air Assault Brigades. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kursk_campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kursk_campaign))

Reuters reports on August 26, 2024, that Russia said Ukraine had lost 73 tanks, 61 armored personnel carriers and 404 armored combat vehicles in the Kursk region. The article also mentions an incursion by Ukraine into the Kursk region. ([https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-says-it-pummelled-ukrainian-forces-along-kursk-front-2024-08-26/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-says-it-pummelled-ukrainian-forces-along-kursk-front-2024-08-26/)) The Al Jazeera article, published on August 29, 2024, discusses Ukraine's ground offensive inside Russian territory, specifically in the Kursk region. <image:k> shows a building on fire in Sudzha, Russia, after a cross-border incursion of Ukrainian troops into the Kursk region on August 7, 2024. The article mentions that Russia was moving its aircraft back from airfields near the Ukrainian border. The article also mentions that the Kursk offensive had greatly reduced Russia’s use of aviation against northeastern Ukraine.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Ukraine launched an incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024, and that there were tank losses on the Ukrainian side. The Reuters article states that Russia claimed Ukraine lost 73 tanks in the Kursk region. The reverse image search shows that the image of destroyed tanks appears in multiple sources. However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that the image depicts destroyed Ukrainian tanks during the Kursk incursion.

To verify the claim, additional information is needed to confirm that the image specifically depicts the events of the Kursk incursion and that the destroyed tanks are Ukrainian.
