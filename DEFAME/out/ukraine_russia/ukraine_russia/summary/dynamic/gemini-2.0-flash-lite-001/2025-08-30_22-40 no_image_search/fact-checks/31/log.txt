Content: The Wikipedia article discusses the Law of Ukraine "On the Protection of the Constitutional Order in the Field of Activities of Religious Organizations," informally known as the "Law on the Prohibition of the Russian Orthodox Church in Ukraine." The law was passed by the Verkhovna Rada on August 20, 2024, and entered into force on September 23, 2024. The law makes it impossible for religious organizations to operate under the control of a state that carries out aggression against Ukraine. The article also mentions that the All-Ukrainian Council of Churches and Religious Organizations supported the legislative initiative to ban the activities of religious organizations associated with the Russian Federation on August 17, 2024.
