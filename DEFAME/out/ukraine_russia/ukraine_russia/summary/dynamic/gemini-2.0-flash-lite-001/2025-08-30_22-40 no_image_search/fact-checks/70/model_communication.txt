The devastating Russian-Ukrainian war has been ongoing for several years, with the United States and NATO providing support to Ukraine. A report can be read [here](https://tass.com/russia/1728697)
. 

**Clarification:**

Peskov’s Comments: It is important to note that Peskov’s remarks about the United States being an “enemy” were part of a broader narrative criticizing American policies and actions towards Russia. The confusion may stem from a recent shift in Russian officials’ rhetoric amid ongoing tensions over the Ukraine conflict.

**Background:**

**Recent Statements by Russian Officials:** Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov referred to the United States as an “enemy” state in a recent press interaction. More details can be read [here](https://www.trtworld.com/us-and-canada/russia-formally-declares-the-us-as-enemy-what-next-18170984)
.

**Misinterpretation**: Peskov’s statement, “We are now an enemy country for them, just as they are for us,” has been misinterpreted on social media as a declaration of war. This is a significant escalation from the term “unfriendly states” that Russian officials have used previously to describe the United States and its allies.

**Context**: Peskov’s comments followed actions by the Biden administration, allowing Ukraine to use American-supplied weapons to attack targets within Russia. In this context, a significant amount of misleading information regarding the situation is being spread on social media.

**Social Media Posts** 

Social media posts claim that Russia has declared war against the USA.

! Details can be read [here](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy770l9llnzo)
. 

**Historical Rhetoric:** Russian President Vladimir Putin has previously referred to the Western countries’ elites as Russia’s enemies while characterizing Ukraine as a tool used by the West. The rhetoric from Russian officials reflects escalating tensions but does not amount to a declaration of war. Social media users should be cautious about misinterpreting or amplifying such statements without verifying the facts through reliable sources.

Ukrainians sought shelter in underground shelters as Russian forces attacked on 24 February 2022

Launching the biggest European invasion since the end of World War Two, Putin gave a fiery speech on TV declaring his goal was to "demilitarise and denazify" Ukraine.

Russia has repeatedly painted modern Ukraine as a Nazi state, in a crass distortion of history.

Putin had already seized Ukraine's Crimean peninsula eight years earlier, after a revolution that ousted Ukraine's pro-Russian president and replaced him with a more pro-Western government.

Putin then triggered a lower-level war in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, with pro-Russian proxy forces occupying territory and setting up rebel states supported by Moscow.

But the 2022 invasion was on a different scale.

Putin had just [recognised the rebel states as independent](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-europe-60470900)
. He has spoken of the Ukrainian leader's "illegitimacy" - a false narrative that has also been repeated by President Trump.

As evidence Putin cites the postponement of Ukraine's March 2024 presidential election, although it is because of Russia's war that Ukraine is under martial law and elections are barred under the constitution.

Putin's own re-election in 2024 is highly questionable, as Russia's opposition leaders are either in exile or dead.

Was Nato expansion to blame for the war?
----------------------------------------

Putin has for years complained about Nato's eastward expansion as a security threat, and sees any possibility of Ukraine joining the alliance as a major red line.

Before Russia's 2022 invasion he demanded that Nato remove multinational deployments from the Central and Eastern European states that joined the Western alliance after 1997.

But it was Russia that launched military action in Eastern Europe, when it invaded Georgia in 2008 and then Crimea in 2014.

After the Crimea invasion, Nato established a continuous presence on its eastern flank - closest to Russia.

Nato has always stressed the whole purpose of the alliance is to defend territories "with no aggressive intentions". <image:2680>!A map showing the expansion of Nato over time <image:2687>

Zelensky said as much two weeks into the invasion: "Nato is not prepared to accept Ukraine."

He has since said he would consider resigning in exchange for Nato membership, but Trump says Kyiv should "forget about" joining the Western alliance.

Putin has accused Nato of participating in the war, because its member states have increasingly sent Ukraine military hardware, including tanks and fighter jets, air defence systems, missile systems, artillery and drones.

Nato has provided security assistance and training to Ukraine, but it insists that does not make it a party to the war.

Putin's grievance against Nato dates back to 1990, when he claims the West promised not to expand "an inch to the East".

However that was before the Soviet Union collapsed and it was based on a limited commitment made to then Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.

Gorbachev said "the topic of Nato expansion was never discussed" at the time.

How could the war end?
----------------------

The most likely route is through direct talks, although previous rounds of negotiations between the two sides made little progress on a ceasefire.

After a fifth visit to Moscow by Trump envoy Steve Witkoff on 6 August, the US president said a there was a "good chance" he could meet the Russian and Ukrainian leaders for talks in person.

The Kremlin also said a Trump-Putin meeting would happen in the coming days, but Putin ruled out an imminent meeting with Zelensky, saying the right conditions were not in place.

So far though, the two sides have been unable to find a way of bridging their differences.

Russia wants direct talks to address the "root causes of the conflict", a phrase that harks back to Putin's "maximalist" demands at the start of the war in March 2022.

These included Ukraine becoming a neutral state, dramatically reducing its military and abandoning its Nato aspirations.

Russia also wants international recognition of its territorial gains in Ukraine reflected in any future deal, including annexation of Crimea and four eastern regions. <image:2680>!Reuters Vladimir Putin remembering Russia's victory over Nazi Germany wears a long coat as soldiers pass him by carrying swords <image:2689>Reuters

Vladimir Putin has made repeated false allegations of genocide and Nazi taunts against Ukraine

At the start of the 2022 invasion, Putin vowed to protect people in occupied areas of eastern Ukraine from eight years of Ukrainian "bullying and genocide, during the war in the east.

More than 14,000 people died on both sides of the front line between 2014-2022, but Russian claims of Ukrainian Nazis committing genocide in the occupied regions never added up, and no international body has spoken of genocide. It abandoned its nuclear weapons in 1994 in return for guaranteed security from Russia, the UK and US which Moscow failed to respect.

Since the war, many Ukrainians have turned their back on Russian, and Zelensky himself avoids using the language in public.

When Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered up to 200,000 soldiers into Ukraine, his aim was to sweep into the capital, Kyiv, in days, overthrow its pro-Western government and return Ukraine to Russia's sphere of influence.

Putin failed but, more than three years on, a fifth of Ukrainian territory is in Russian hands.

US President Donald Trump has been trying to negotiate a peace deal and the Kremlin says Putin will meet Trump "in the coming days". Last year he told US TV talk show host Tucker Carlson that Ukraine was an "artificial state".

Those comments have led many to believe that the goal of the invasion was in effect to erase the state of Ukraine.

Russia's state-run Ria news agency explained that "denazification is inevitably also de-Ukrainisation" - seemingly tying the idea of erasing Ukraine to the stated goal of the invasion.

Ukrainian culture and identity have in fact existed for centuries independently of Russia.

Does Putin want to get rid of Zelensky?
---------------------------------------

! <image:2680>!Getty Images The president of Ukraine holds his hands out, flanked by two Ukrainian flags <image:2685>Getty Images

Volodymyr Zelensky was elected president in Ukraine in 2019

Putin has long sought to get rid of Ukraine's elected pro-Western president, and Zelensky was apparently a target from the very start of the war.

Russian troops made two attempts to storm the presidential compound soon after the invasion, according to Zelensky's adviser, and Ukraine's elected leader said they wanted him dead.

"The enemy has designated me as target number one; my family is target number two.

"[They want to destroy Ukraine politically](https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/zvernennya-prezidenta-do-ukrayinciv-naprikinci-pershogo-dnya-73149)
 by destroying the head of state."

Zelensky said later that Putin had initially tried to replace him with the wealthy head of a pro-Russian party, Viktor Medvedchuk, who was accused of treason in Ukraine and is now in Russia.

Even now, Putin has not agreed to peace talks with Zelensky and his officials call him a "loser" and a "clown". It will also look for Western security guarantees to ensure Russia never invades its territory again.

Was Zelensky to blame for the war?
----------------------------------

Before his return to the White House and in the first months of his presidency, Trump suggested Ukraine's president was responsible for the war with Russia.

"\[Zelensky\] should never have let the war start, that war's a loser," he said in October 2024.

In reality, the war began in 2014, when Putin seized Crimea and Russian proxies grabbed part of eastern Ukraine. Putin then ordered Russia's full-scale invasion eight years later, after months of meticulous co-ordination and denials of any such plan.

However, the US president's messaging has not been altogether consistent, and in recent weeks his position appears to have hardened against Russia.

"We thought we had \[the war\] settled numerous times, and then President Putin goes out and starts launching rockets into some city like Kyiv and kills a lot of people," he said last month.

Trump has announced sweeping new secondary tariffs on any country still trading with Russia if a ceasefire with Ukraine is not agreed by Friday, 8 August.

Do Putin's claims on Nazis and genocide stack up?

Content: "After each of them—Serbia in 2000, Georgia in 2003, Ukraine in 2004, the Arab Spring in 2011, Russia in 2011–12, and Ukraine in 2013–14—Putin has pivoted to more hostile policies toward the United States, and then invoked the NATO threat as justification for doing so.

Boris Yeltsin never supported NATO expansion but acquiesced to the first round of expansion in 1997 because he believed that his close ties to President Bill Clinton and the United States were not worth sacrificing over this comparatively smaller matter. Following John Mearsheimer’s provocative 2014 _Foreign Affairs_ article arguing that “the Ukraine crisis is the West’s fault,” the narrative of Russian backlash against NATO expansion has become a dominant framework for explaining—if not justifying—Moscow’s ongoing war against Ukraine.[1](#f1)
 This notion has been repeated not only in Moscow but in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere by politicians, analysts, and writers. By this telling, the specter of Ukraine’s NATO membership points both to the cause of the conflict and its solution: Take membership off the table for Ukraine, so the argument goes, and future wars will be prevented.

### Michael McFaul

_**Michael McFaul**, former U.S. If NATO was _always_ a threat to Russia and its “sphere of influence,” why did Putin facilitate the opening of these bases in the former Soviet Union?

During his November 2001 visit to the United States, Putin struck a realistic but cooperative tone:

> We differ in the ways and means we perceive that are suitable for reaching the same objective . Putin blamed the United States directly for assisting this democratic breakthrough and helping to install someone whom he saw as a pro-American puppet, President Mikheil Saakashvili. Since the Revolution of Dignity, Putin has waged an unprecedented assault against Ukraine’s democracy using a full spectrum of military, political, informational, social, and economic weapons in an attempt to destabilize and eventually topple Ukraine’s democratically elected government.[18](#f18)
 Ukraine’s relationship with NATO and the United States was just a symptom of what Putin believes is the underlying disease: a sovereign, democratic Ukraine.

Putin’s Real _Casus Belli_: Ukrainian Democracy

Clips of Hegseth calling Vladimir Putin a "war criminal" appeared online after he was nominated as secretary of defense by President-elect Donald Trump. Think about it through the psychology of him."

The Facts

While Hegseth aligned with the claim that Putin was a "war criminal," the clip shared online was from March 2022 not long after the outbreak of the conflict.

Since then Hegseth has been more cautious, and critical of the U.S. spending on the conflict, claims appeared on social media repeating comments Hegseth had made criticizing Russian President [Vladimir Putin](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/vladimir-putin)
 in bold terms.

!Pete Hegseth <image:2703>

Pete Hegseth on May 31, 2019, in New York City. intervention in Ukraine and the prognosis from others that Russia's intervention would lead to wider conflict.

In an episode of the _Shawn Ryan Show_ Podcast from November 2024, Hegseth said he did not see Putin taking the world into a wider global or nuclear conflict, saying his gains would be incremental, part of what he called a "get my s\*\*\* back" conflict.

"I found it overinflated from the beginning this idea that Vladimir Putin's attack on Ukraine was going to lead to nuclear war or war across the continent," Hegseth said.

"I've always felt like it was from the beginning, like a couple days in, I like, this feels like the Putin's 'give me my s\*\*\* back' war.

"It kind of feels like \[Putin thought\] 'I feel like you've been pushing pretty hard, and we used to have the former Soviet Union, and we're pretty proud of that, and Ukraine was a part of it, and all these other... I think he probably knows enough to know that it's probably not going much further than Ukraine.

"And I don't think he's a suicidal maniac who's hell-bent on bringing in armageddon with nuclear warfare."

Elsewhere, he has also defended Trump's comment in 2022 calling Putin "very savvy" after the Russian president announced Moscow's recognition of the independence of [two self-proclaimed republics](https://www.newsweek.com/blinken-says-swift-response-needed-russia-recognizing-new-republics-1681212)
 in eastern Ukraine.

While the White House and the [EU](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/eu)
 described Putin's actions as a violation of international law and a pretext for an invasion, Trump said [Putin's move was "genius" and "very savvy."](https://www.newsweek.com/trump-calls-putin-moving-troops-ukraine-peacekeeping-genius-1681557)

Hegseth defended the comments saying that Trump was trying to tease the media for obsessing over the Russian leader

"Here's the reality, Vladimir Putin lives rent-free in the minds of our media, of the American media," Hegseth said.

"No organism, no entity has done more to spread Russian propaganda and to prop up the strawman that is Vladimir Putin than our very own media."

Trump this week suggested NATO enlargement provoked Russia to invade Ukraine, but Wicker didn't agree.

“There are good guys and bad guys in this war, and the Russians are the bad guys,” Wicker said. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth made a “rookie mistake” when he said a return to Ukraine’s pre-war borders was “unrealistic,” Senate Armed Services Chair Roger Wicker said Friday.

Hegseth on Thursday [pulled back some of the comments](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/13/hegseth-pull-back-00204088)
 he made about Ukraine a day earlier, where he said that NATO membership for Kyiv was off the table and that the country could not return to its internationally recognized borders. 

“Hegseth is going to be a great defense secretary, although he wasn’t my choice for the job,” the Mississippi Republican [told POLITICO on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference](https://www.politico.eu/politico-munich-security-conference-2025/)
. Wicker said he favors a firm posture with Moscow.

“Everybody knows … and people in the administration know you don't say before your first meeting what you will agree to and what you won't agree to,” Wicker said, adding that he was “puzzled” and “disturbed” by Hegseth’s comments.

President Donald Trump this week held a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on ending the war; Vice President JD Vance will meet in Munich Friday with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Hegseth wasn't freelancing. “But he made a rookie mistake in Brussels and he’s walked back some of what he said but not that line."

"I don’t know who wrote the speech — it is the kind of thing Tucker Carlson could have written, and Carlson is a fool," Wicker said, referring to the pro-Putin broadcaster.

Speaking to Jonathan Martin at the POLITICO Pub in the Munich conference, Wicker — a staunch Ukraine supporter — said he was “surprised” by Hegseth’s original comments and “heartened” that the new defense secretary had reversed course. Trump on Thursday said there was a "good possibility of ending that horrible, very bloody war." He also said it was not "practical" for Kyiv to join NATO and "unlikely" that Ukraine could return to its 2014 pre-invasion borders.

The direct talks between Trump and Putin have left European allies rattled that the EU and Ukraine could be sidelined in any peace deal.

Amid Trump’s talks with Putin, Wicker took a more hawkish stance that is in line with traditional Republican views. resolve, arguing that failing to arm Ukraine could force American troops into future wars.

On Friday, Wicker also called for the U.S."

Content: "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth over the Trump administration’s effort to end the Ukraine war through negotiations involving Russia.

The session revealed deep divisions within the GOP on U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth (R) looks on as U.S. [Mitch McConnell](https://kyivindependent.com/mcconnells-exit-signals-shift-in-republican-support-for-ukraine/)
 of Kentucky, one of three Republicans who voted against Hegseth’s confirmation, who warned, "America’s reputation is on the line."

McConnell, now chair of the panel overseeing defense funding, issued some of his strongest public criticism yet, questioning whether the United States would continue defending democratic allies against authoritarian threats.

He contrasted his stance — rooted in a Reagan-era commitment to global leadership — with Hegseth’s "America First" approach favored by many Trump supporters. "We don’t want a headline at the end of this conflict that says [Russia](https://kyivindependent.com/tag/russia/)
 wins and America loses," McConnell said.

When asked who the aggressor in the three-year-old war is, [Hegseth](https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-bracing-for-painful-reduction-in-us-military-aid-after-hegseth-announces-cuts/)
 responded, "Russia is the aggressor." But he avoided directly stating which side the U.S. wants to see win, instead emphasizing that President Trump is committed to achieving peace.

An F-16 Fighting Falcon rests inside a warehouse near March Air Reserve Base after crashing on May 16, 2019. The missiles on board did not explode. The plane suffered a loss of hydraulic pressure, rendering the pilot unable to control the jet, the U.S. Air Force said April 23, 2020. (Courtesy of U.S. Air Force)

The U.S. Air Force has answered a questioned that burned in people’s minds as bystanders were hurriedly pushed back to safer locations several times and the 215 Freeway was closed after [the crash of an Air National Guard F-16 fighter jet](https://www.pressenterprise.com/2019/05/16/plane-crashes-near-march-air-reserve-base-215-freeway-shut-down/)
 near March Air Reserve Base in 2019:

Why didn’t the missiles aboard the Flying Falcon explode on impact?

The reason, the Air Force said this week, is that the ordnance attached to the F-16 during its intercept training mission were never armed.

“Aircraft flying this mission do fly with live ordnance. In order for the weapons to detonate, there are multiple conditions that must be met, including arming and launching of the weapon to complete the detonation sequences,” said Capt. Tisha J. Yates, an Air Force spokeswoman at Joint Base Langley-Eustis in Virginia.

The missiles were eventually removed from the jet as it sat in a warehouse on Opportunity Way near the Riverside-Moreno Valley border. They were trucked to nearby Ben Clark Training Center, [where they were destroyed in a controlled detonation](https://www.pressenterprise.com/2019/05/17/x-9/)
.

“The determination to move civilians away from the scene was a safety measure put in place by the incident commander on scene and in coordination with NORAD based on the hazards present until all munitions were secured,” Yates said in response to questions from this news organization, [which first reported the cause of the crash](https://www.pressenterprise.com/2020/04/23/hydraulic-failure-caused-f-16-to-crash-near-march-base-last-year-air-force-says/)
.

The F-16 was assigned to the 114th Fighter Wing at Joe Foss Field in South Dakota. The pilot was attached to the 144th Fighter Wing at March.

On May 16, 2019, the pilot was returning from the two-jet maneuvers about 120 miles east of March when he lost hydraulic pressure and therefore the ability to control the aircraft. At 3:39 p.m., after burning off fuel, he ejected about 250 feet off the ground less than a mile from the base. The pilot suffered minor injuries, as did about a dozen people in the warehouse where the plane crashed.

The Air Force concluded in its 22-page accident report that the $24 million jet lost the fluid from its two hydraulic tanks when two inlet check valves — each less than an inch tall — failed because they were improperly installed.

Each valve consists of a cap, screw threads, a retainer ring and an O-ring that collectively are referred to as a screw cap. That screw cap screws into the valve body. The retainer helps keep the O-ring in place. It is primarily the screw cap retainer and O-ring that prevent hydraulic fluid from leaking under high pressure.

The investigation determined that both screw caps were not properly screwed into the valve bodies. The retainers were found to be deformed, and portions of the O-rings were missing. As a result, hydraulic fluid leaked out through the threads between the screw caps and the valve bodies.

A suspected hydraulic leak had been noted in the jet in March 2019. A new flight-control system that had been overhauled months earlier was installed on March 28, and the plane flew 10 more missions without incident before the crash. The report concluded that the overhaul process lacked “an effective procedure to identify improper installation of ISA check valves.” ISA stands for Integrated Servo Actuator, a flight-control system.

In the wake of the crash, the Air Force also said this week that it studied the overhaul process and found a problem with how the inlet check valve was assembled during overhauls, said Derek Kaufman, a civilian spokesman for the Air Force Materiel Command at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio.

There are two approved configurations of the valves. The older configuration uses smaller Teflon backing rings, and newer configurations use larger rings. The team discovered the potential for installation of the wrong-size backing ring since both size rings were packaged side by side, Kaufman said.

As a result, the Air Force changed the process for assembling the valves during overhauls. It separated the installation and inspection steps on the work documentation and added a secondary quality check for just O-ring backing ring installation. And it inserted a “quality stamp” of the entire process for the first six months after the changes to ensure proper training was accomplished.

The Air Force also inspected all of its inlet check valves and found three to be defective. Those were fixed, Kaufman said.

“We review the facts for any lessons that can be applied to maintenance processes and training to improve the safety and quality of systems we deliver to our warfighters,” he said.

The improper installation of two parts caused an [F-16](/weapons/f-16/ "Learn more about the F-16 Fighting Falcon")
‘s hydraulic system to fail, making the pilot [lose control and crash into a warehouse in May 2019](https://www.airforcemag.com/f-16-crashes-during-norad-training-in-california/)
 while flying back to March Air Reserve Base, Calif., Air Force investigators found.

The F-16 pilot successfully ejected before the Viper crashed into the civilian building. The aircraft was destroyed at a loss of $24.99 million, and caused about $3.9 million in damage to the warehouse, according to an Air Combat Command Accident Investigation Board report.

The F-16C, tail number 88-0477 from the South Dakota Air National Guard’s 114th Fighter Wing, was operated by a pilot from the California Air National Guard’s 144th Fighter Wing Detachment 1 at March for homeland defense missions. On May 16, 2019, the F-16C took off as part of a two-ship formation for an aerospace control alert training mission in a nearby military operating area.

The two F-16s flew one-versus-one tactical intercepts, low-level proficiency training, and local area familiarization. While flying near Palm Springs, the pilot began receiving cockpit warnings of a potential hydraulic system issue with gauges showing low pressure and began going through appropriate checklists, according to the report.

About 20 miles from base, the pilot deployed speed brakes and lowered the landing gear to burn more fuel and let the wingman visually inspect the aircraft. With the speed brakes and gear deployed and locked, the pilot did not yet declare an emergency, but continued the approach to March, the report states.

The aircraft then indicated further loss of pressure in both of its “A and B” systems, and the pilot consulted checklists for dual hydraulic failure. Once they got close to the base, the wingman landed first on one of the base’s runways, allowing the damaged F-16 to land on a runway with an arresting cable.

With both hydraulic systems failing, the pilot declared an emergency and turned on emergency power as a precaution before starting a straight-in approach to the runway. About one mile before touching down, at about 300 feet above ground level, the F-16 began to roll to the left without any pilot input. The pilot tried to maintain control, and counter the roll, but the aircraft rolled hard to the right in a way that was inconsistent with the pilot’s input.

After losing control of the aircraft, the pilot ejected. Immediately after punching out, the F-16 crashed into the warehouse, located across a major highway from the base. A photograph of the impact shows the F-16’s nose sheared off and wings largely removed in a pile of boxes and equipment. The pilot parachuted onto the runway overrun at the base, and was briefly hospitalized with minor injuries.

The Accident Investigation Board found that the cause of the mishap was two improperly installed hydraulic check valves in the aircraft’s right flaperon integrated survoactuator—a part that translates electrical commands to the movement of flight control surfaces. For both of the parts that failed, investigators found the same problem: the retainer on a screw cap had deformed, with fragments tearing away allowing fluid to leak.

“This condition allowed hydraulic fluid to leak from both systems resulting in decreased hydraulic pressure to move flight control surfaces,” the report said. “The \[pilot\] set up to land as soon as possible, but the system had lost enough pressure on final approach to prevent the \[aircraft\] from sustaining controlled flight.”

Maintainers with the 144th Fighter Wing Detachment 1 installed the parts as part of unscheduled maintenance in March 2019 after a possible hydraulic leak was discovered. The parts went through operational checks with no discrepancies found, and the aircraft had flown 10 sorties for 16.3 hours before the crash. The AIB states that there was an inadequate overhaul process, which lacked an effective procedure to identify problems with the installation of the check valves.

A loss of hydraulic pressure prevented the pilot of the Air National Guard’s F-16 [that crashed near March Air Reserve Base](https://www.pe.com/2019/05/16/plane-crashes-near-march-air-reserve-base-215-freeway-shut-down/)
 last year from controlling the jet, the U.S. Air Force says in a report.

The pilot ejected and parachuted onto a base runway on May 16, 2019, suffering minor injuries. The $24 million Fighting Falcon plummeted through the roof of a warehouse, destroying the jet and causing a small fire.

Twelve people in the warehouse were treated for exposure to the debris, the Cal Fire/Riverside County Fire Department said at the time.

The 22-page report, dated April 14, said two inlet-check valves were improperly installed, resulting in damage to them that caused hydraulic fuel to leak.

The valves were part of a flight-control system that was overhauled in January 2019 and installed in the jet after a possible hydraulic leak was discovered several months later.

“The evidence also indicated an inadequate overhaul process that lacked an effective procedure to identify improper installation of ISA check valves,” the report says.

The F-16 was one of two jets initially practicing 120 miles east of March, which sits on the Riverside-Moreno Valley border. The planes were returning to March when the one jet lost hydraulic pressure.

The pilot burned off fuel before ejecting, the report says.

The F-16 was assigned to the 114th Fighter Wing at Joe Foss Field in South Dakota and ran some missions for the 144th Fighter Wing at March.

An explosion of a drone is seen in the sky over the city during a Russian drone, amid Russia's attack on Ukraine, in Kyiv, Ukraine June 28, 2025.

Gleb Garanich/Reuters

CNN  — 

A Ukrainian pilot was killed and his F-16 fighter jet crashed after Russia launched a huge aerial assault involving hundreds of drones and scores of missiles overnight, the Ukrainian military said on Sunday.

The airman, named as 1st Class Lt. Maksym Ustymenko by the Ukrainian air force, was the third F-16 pilot killed since the Ukrainians began flying the jets last summer, and his plane was the fourth F-16 Ukraine has lost since then.

The air force said Ustymenko “did everything he could to steer the aircraft away from a populated area, but he did not have time to eject.”

Ustymenko’s death is a major loss for Ukraine. But Kyiv is at risk of running out of missiles for these systems, as Trump continues to threaten withdrawing US aid from Ukraine.

The Ukrainian air force said Sunday it had downed 211 drones and 38 missiles launched by Moscow overnight. Only a small number of the country’s top pilots have been trained to fly F-16s, the most advanced of Ukraine’s fighter jets. The training is highly specialized and takes months to complete.

Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ustymenko destroyed seven targets before being killed, praising him and the Ukrainian air force for “heroically protecting” the country’s skies.

Zelensky said Moscow launched 477 drones and 60 missiles towards six different locations overnight into Sunday – one of Russia’s largest ever aerial assaults in terms of weapons deployed, according to a CNN tally.

Deadly aerial attacks
---------------------

Russia has ramped up its [airborne attacks](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/15/europe/russia-tactics-swarms-of-killer-drones-intl-cmd)
 against Ukraine in recent weeks, launching hundreds of drones and missiles nearly every night.

These assaults are not just bigger and more frequent; they are also more concentrated and executed in a way that makes them a lot more difficult to combat – as they are flown at higher altitudes, out of reach of machine guns.

Zelensky said on Sunday that more than 114 missiles, over 1,270 drones, and nearly 1,100 glide bombs were launched by Russia against Ukraine just this week.

The Ukrainian leader pleaded with Kyiv’s Western allies to provide more aerial defenses for his country, saying Russia will continue to attack Ukraine for as long as it can.

“This war must be brought to an end — pressure on the aggressor is needed, and so is protection. Protection from ballistic and other missiles, from drones, and from terror,” Zelensky said.

He added that Ukraine was ready to buy “American systems” to strengthen its air defenses – a clear call to US President Donald Trump and his administration to allow Ukraine to purchase the Patriot air defense systems.

The Patriots are widely considered to be among the best air defense systems. While there are other systems manufactured by some of Ukraine’s other allies, none can match the Patriots when it comes to protection against advanced hypersonic and ballistic missiles.

Ukraine is known to have roughly half a dozen of the [US-made Patriot air defense systems](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/05/world/trump-cut-ukrainian-aid-patriot-missiles-intl)
, although the exact numbers and their locations are closely guarded secrets.

The Patriots play a crucial role in Ukraine’s air defense, protecting millions of civilians from Russian missiles. Russian strikes were recorded in six locations with debris reported across eight locations, it added.

The Russian Ministry of Defense claimed the strikes targeted Ukraine’s “military-industrial complex facilities and oil refineries,” but the Ukrainians said civilian infrastructure objects were hit.

At least 11 people were injured, including two children, in a Russian attack in the city of Smila, in the central region of Cherkasy, local officials said in an update on Sunday.

Three nine-story buildings, private houses, and cars were significantly damaged in the shelling, as well as four educational institutions and a psychiatric hospital, Ihor Taburets, head of Cherkasy regional military administration, said.

Landmines question
------------------

Also on Sunday, Zelensky announced he signed a decree that would take Ukraine out of the Ottawa Treaty, the international agreement that bans the use of anti-personnel landmines.

A long-signalled move by Ukraine, the withdrawal still needs to be approved by Ukraine’s parliament. We cannot remain bound by conditions when the enemy has no restrictions,” Roman Kostenko, a member of the Ukrainian Parliament, said in a statement.

According to the United Nations, Ukraine is the most heavily mined country in the world. The US under the Biden Administration approved shipments of landmines to Ukraine last November.

Large swathes of Ukrainian land, especially along the frontlines in the east and in areas that were once occupied by Russia, are off limits to civilians because of the mines."

Russia's Defense Ministry characterized the barrage as a "massive strike with high-precision long-range air, sea and land-based weapons, including the Kinzhal aeroballistic hypersonic missile system, as well as unmanned aerial vehicles, against military-industrial complex facilities and oil refineries in Ukraine."

"The strike's objective was achieved, all designated targets were hit," the ministry said in a post to Telegram.

The ministry also said its forces shot down three Ukrainian drones overnight.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that a residential building in the town of Smila, close to the central city of Cherkasy, was among those hit by drones, with one child injured.

Zelenskyy also said he had ordered an investigation into Ustimenko's death, adding "Ukrainian aviation heroically defends the sky. "The work of Ukrainian fighters is extremely dangerous," it said.

Among the pilots was Lt. Saturday night's attack was one of -- if not the -- largest of Moscow's war to date.

In Poland -- which borders Ukraine to its west -- the Armed Forces Operational Command said in a post to X that the Russian strikes prompted Polish and allied aircraft to be scrambled.

The command said it "activated all available forces and resources at his disposal, the duty fighter pairs have been scrambled and the ground-based air defense and radar reconnaissance systems have reached the highest state of readiness. Ustimenko, it added, guided the plane away from residential areas on the ground but "did not have time to eject."

KYIV/LVIV, Ukraine, June 29 (Reuters) - A Ukrainian F-16 fighter pilot died in a crash while repelling a Russian air attack that involved hundreds of drones, cruise and ballistic missiles, authorities said on Sunday, as Moscow intensifies night-time air barrages in the [fourth year of war](https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraine-russia-war/)
.

President Volodymyr Zelenskiy praised the pilot, Maksym Ustymenko, and bestowed upon him posthumously the title of Hero of Ukraine, the country's highest decoration.

Sign up [here.](undefined?location=article-paragraph&redirectUrl=%2Fbusiness%2Faerospace-defense%2Fleast-six-wounded-large-scale-russian-air-attack-ukraine-ukrainian-authorities-2025-06-29%2F)

He also called for more support from Washington and Western allies to bolster Ukraine's air defences after the attack, which damaged homes and infrastructure across the country and injured at least 12 people, according to local authorities.

In Kyiv, families huddled in metro stations for shelter after air raid sirens rung out. Kyiv has not revealed the size of its F-16 fleet, but they have become a central and heavily used part of Ukraine's defences.

The pilot flew the damaged jet away from a settlement but had no time to eject before it crashed, the Ukrainian Air Force said.

"The pilot used all of his onboard weapons and shot down seven air targets. While shooting down the last one, his aircraft was damaged and began to lose altitude," the Air Force said on Telegram.

Ukrainian military expert Roman Svitan, speaking earlier this month, said the F-16 was not ideally suited to all tasks in the war, particularly repelling drones which swarm Ukrainian cities, as it is better used against higher-speed targets.

Zelenskiy, speaking in his nightly video address, said Ustymenko had been flying missions since the time of a campaign that began in 2014 against Russian-financed separatists who had seized parts of eastern Ukraine.

"He mastered four types of aircraft and had important results to his name in defending Ukraine," he said. Machine-gun fire and explosions were heard across the capital and in the western city of Lviv, where such attacks are less common.

The governor of the Lviv region, bordering Poland, said the raid targeted critical infrastructure.

Ukraine has now [lost](/world/europe/ukraine-pilot-killed-f-16-fighter-jet-lost-ukrainian-military-says-2025-06-29/)
 three F-16s since it began operating the U.S.-made jets last year. "It is painful to lose such people."

The Ukrainian military said in total Russia launched 477 drones and 60 missiles of various types to Ukraine overnight. Ukrainian forces destroyed 211 of the drones and 38 missiles, it said, while 225 more drones were either lost due to electronic warfare or were decoys that carried no explosives.

Writing earlier on X, Zelenskiy said: "Moscow will not stop as long as it has the capability to launch massive strikes." He said Russia had launched around 114 missiles, 1,270 drones, and 1,100 glide bombs just in the past week.

Russia's state-run RIA Novosti news agency said one person was killed by a Ukrainian drone in the Russian-controlled part of Ukraine's Luhansk region. Both Ukraine and Russia say they do not attack civilian targets.

POLITICAL WILL
--------------

Ukraine says recent attacks highlight the need for further support from Washington, which under President Donald Trump has not committed to new military aid for Ukraine.

Trump said he was considering a Ukrainian request [for more Patriot missile, opens new tab](europe)
 batteries after he met Zelenskiy at a NATO summit last Wednesday.

"This war must be brought to an end - pressure on the aggressor is needed, and so is protection," Zelenskiy said in his X post. "Ukraine needs to strengthen its air defence - the thing that best protects lives."

He said Ukraine was ready to buy the American air defence systems and it counts on "leadership, political will, and the support of the United States, Europe, and all our partners."

Russia has launched large-scale strikes on Ukrainian cities every few days in recent weeks, causing widespread damage, killing dozens of civilians and injuring hundreds more.

During the latest barrage, explosions were heard in Kyiv, Lviv, Poltava, Mykolaiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Cherkasy and the Ivano-Frankivsk regions, witnesses and regional governors said. The Ukrainian military said air strikes were recorded in six locations.

Eleven people, including two children, were injured in the central Cherkasy region, the regional governor said on Telegram."

Renovated in 2018, the facility in Toropets is estimated to have stored tonnes upon tonnes of military goods, including explosives, artillery shells and ballistic missiles.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A Ukrainian drone attack on a significant Russian weapons stockpile in the Tver region in the early hours of Wednesday might be the Ukrainian army's biggest hit against Moscow's arsenal since early 2022.

The blast from the strike was so strong that earthquake monitoring stations picked it up as if it were a minor earthquake, while NASA reported a series of heat sources spotted by its equipment from space.

The facility in Toropets is estimated to have stored around 30,000 tonnes of military munitions. The destruction of the ammunition that was stored there will most likely negatively affect the northern operational group of the Russian army.

But what is the Russian military storage facility in Toropets and how important is it?

Renovated in 2018, the facility in Toropets is estimated to have stored tonnes upon tonnes of military goods, including explosives, artillery shells and ballistic missiles.

The former Russian deputy defence minister Dmitry Bulgakov — who was arrested earlier this year on corruption charges — said after the renovations that the site met the "highest international standards" and could defend weapons from missiles and "even a small nuclear attack".

The storage site covered an area of over 5 square kilometres in size and a perimeter of more than 12 kilometres long. 

**Which missiles were stored at the facility?**
-----------------------------------------------

The town of Toropets is situated around 470 kilometers north of the Ukrainian border and the destruction of the ammunition that was stored there will most likely negatively affect the northern operational group of the Russian army, including the supply of troops in Kursk, Belgorod and Bryansk.

According to Ukrainian sources, the military site in Toropets reportedly housed fuel tanks, as well as missiles intended for Iskander missile systems, Tochka-U missile systems, guided aerial bombs and assorted artillery ammunition.

The head of Ukraine's Centre for Countering Disinformation, Andriy Kovalenko, said that in addition to its own ammunition, Russia had also started to store North Korean munitions in Toropets.

Maxar satellite service collected imagery clearly shows the extent of the damage from the Ukrainian drone attack causing a series of explosions, according to a photo shared by the Russia Team Lead at the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). 

The imagery shows large pillars of smoke covering much of the area, while a closer look at the ammunition storage area indicates that fires continue to burn in and near some bunkers, ISW's George Barros added.

**Have the storage bunkers been destroyed?**
--------------------------------------------

Most of the ammunition is presumably stored underground, so the question is whether Ukraine used any drones that could have penetrated inside the bunkers.

A full damage assessment remains impossible due to the thick smoke above the site. However, the possible destruction of the bunkers might have also been the result of Moscow not respecting its own regulations by placing the bunkers too close together, for example.

While repeatedly calling on the West to lift the restrictions over the use of long-range missiles deep into Russian territory, Ukraine has been using its home-produced UAVs to strike as deep as 1,800 kilometres into Russia, as was the case in the city of Orsk.

LONDON, Sept 18 (Reuters) - A large-scale Ukrainian drone attack on Russia triggered an earthquake-sized blast at a major arsenal in the Tver region on Wednesday, forcing the evacuation of a nearby town, war bloggers and some media reported.

Unverified video and images on social media showed a huge ball of flame blasting into the night sky and multiple detonations thundering across a lake about 380 km (240 miles) west of Moscow.

NASA satellites picked up intense heat sources emanating from an area of about 14 square kilometres (5 square miles) at the site in the early hours and earthquake monitoring stations noted what sensors thought was a small [earthquake, opens new tab](https://www.volcanodiscovery.com/earthquakes/quake-info/9611698/mag2quake-Sep-18-2024-BALTIC-STATES-BELARUS-NW-RUSSIA-REGION.html#google_vignette)
 in the area.

"The enemy hit an ammunition depot in the area of Toropets," said Yuri Podolyaka, a Ukrainian-born, pro-Russian military blogger. "Everything that can burn is already burning there (and exploding)."

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, speaking in his nightly video address, hailed the outcome of the attack without referring specifically to the target.

"A very important result was achieved last night on Russian territory and such actions weaken the enemy," Zelenskiy said. "I thank everyone involved. Such precision is truly inspiring."

He thanked the SBU security service, the HUR intelligence service and the Special Operations Forces.

A source in Ukraine's SBU state security service had earlier told Reuters the drone attack had destroyed [a warehouse storing missiles](/world/europe/ukraine-destroyed-arsenal-russias-tver-region-kyiv-security-source-says-2024-09-18/)
, guided bombs and artillery ammunition.

Russian state media have in the past reported that a major arsenal for conventional weapons was located at the site of the blasts. State media, now subject to military censorship laws, was muted in its reporting on Wednesday.

Igor Rudenya, governor of the Tver region, said that Ukrainian drones had been shot down, that a fire had broken out and that some residents were being evacuated. He did not say what was burning.

One woman told Reuters that members of her family had been evacuated from Toropets.

"A fire started with explosions," said the woman, who identified herself only as Irina.

Rudenya later said the situation in Toropets was stable as of midday local time (0900 GMT) and that evacuated residents could return. The fire had been put out and there were no recorded fatalities, he said.

Russia and Ukraine each reported dozens of enemy drone attacks on their territory overnight, with Russian forces advancing in eastern [Ukraine](https://www.reuters.com/topic/event/ukraine-crisis/)
.

MAJOR EXPLOSION
---------------

The size of the main blast shown in the unverified social media video was consistent with 200-240 tons of high explosives detonating, said George William Herbert of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey in California.

A Toropets chatroom on the Russian social media site VK was flooded with messages of support from other parts of the country and offers of help to people fleeing the town.

Some people were asking whether buildings at specific addresses were still standing.

"People, does anyone know what's happened to Kudino village??? They told me nothing is left of our house," posted one woman.

Another woman replied: "It's horror there." Kudino is a village 4.5 km (2.8 miles) northeast of Toropets.

Some war bloggers asked how drones could trigger such large blasts at what was thought to be a highly fortified facility.

According to an RIA state news agency report from 2018, Russia was building an arsenal for the storage of missiles, ammunition and explosives in Toropets, a 1,000-year-old town, with a population of just over 11,000.

Dmitry Bulgakov, then a deputy defence minister, told RIA in 2018 that the facility could defend weapons from missiles and even a small nuclear attack. Bulgakov was arrested earlier this year on corruption charges, which he denies.

"It (the concrete facilities) ensures their reliable and safe storage, protects them from air and missile strikes and even from the damaging factors of a nuclear explosion," RIA quoted Bulgakov as saying at the time.

Some Russians on chat groups expressed anger.

"Why wasn't the ammunition underground?! What are you doing???? In Kudino, houses were blown away! Why is the forest burning and no one is there... What kind of negligence is this!!!!" one woman posted.

Russia reported that its air defence units had destroyed 54 drones launched against five Russian regions overnight, without mentioning Tver. Ukraine said it had [shot down 46 of 52 drones](/world/europe/russian-drones-attack-energy-facilities-ukraines-sumy-authorities-say-2024-09-18/)
 launched by Moscow overnight and that Russia had used three guided air missiles which did not reach their targets.

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian [drones struck a large military depot in a town deep inside Russia](https://apnews.com/article/poland-us-blinken-duda-ukraine-54232b14cae7785df02f9d48a77e7823)
 overnight, causing a huge fire and forcing some residents to evacuate, a Ukrainian official and Russian news reports said Wednesday. At least 13 people were injured, Russia’s Health Ministry added.

Meanwhile, a senior U.S. diplomat said [Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-kursk-incursion-gamble-battlefield-e862afd58c65d6d2d5b7b3747423ca4d)
 has a workable plan to end the war, now in its third year, although its details have not been publicly disclosed.

Ukraine claimed the strike destroyed military warehouses in Toropets, a town in Russia’s Tver region about 380 kilometers (240 miles) northwest of Moscow and about 500 kilometers (300 miles) from the border with Ukraine.

The attack was carried out by Ukraine’s Security Service, along with Ukraine’s Intelligence and Special Operations Forces, a Kyiv security official told The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the operation.

According to the official, the depot housed Iskander and Tochka-U missiles, as well as glide bombs and artillery shells. He said the facility caught fire in the strike and was burning across an area 6 kilometers (4 miles) wide.

Among the destroyed ammunition were North Korean KN-23 short-range ballistic missiles, another official, in Ukraine’s Intelligence Office, told AP. He also was not authorized to comment publicly and didn’t provide evidence to support his claim.

Russia and North Korea signed [a landmark pact](https://apnews.com/article/russia-putin-kim-north-korea-pact-556492779b6a32c4cf74b992741d91a8)
 in June that envisioned mutual military assistance between Moscow and Pyongyang.

More than 100 domestically produced exploding drones were deployed in the attack on the depot, the Ukrainian intelligence official added.

Russian state news agency RIA Novosti quoted regional authorities as saying air defense systems were working to repel a “massive drone attack” on Toropets, which has a population of about 11,000. The agency also reported a fire and the evacuations, and the Health Ministry said 13 people were hospitalized in the region after the attack.

Tver regional Gov. Igor Rudenya later said all evacuees could return home.

Successful Ukrainian strikes deep inside Russia have become more common as Kyiv developed its drone technology.

Zelenskyy also is seeking approval from Western nations for Ukraine to use the sophisticated weapons they are providing to hit targets inside Russia. Some Western leaders have balked at that, fearing they could be dragged into the conflict.

Part of Kyiv’s strategy is targeting of military equipment, ammunition and infrastructure deep inside Russia, as well as making civilians feel some of the consequences of the war that is being fought largely inside Ukraine.

The swift push by Ukrainian forces [into Russia’s Kursk border region](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-kursk-incursion-putin-1178b99b32b476816db3a48ffa06b11a)
 last month fits into that plan, which apparently seeks to compel Russian President Vladimir Putin to back down.

Putin, however, has shown no signs of that [and has been trying to grind down Ukraine’s resolve](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-putin-military-numbers-9c5554302486adfe7b3d69cb297f8a98)
 through attritional warfare and also sap the West’s support for Kyiv by drawing out the conflict. That has come at a price, however, as the U.K. Defense Ministry estimates the war has probably killed or wounded more than 600,000 Russian troops.

On Tuesday, Putin ordered the country’s military to [increase its number of troops](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-putin-military-numbers-9c5554302486adfe7b3d69cb297f8a98)
 by 180,000 to a total of 1.5 million by Dec. 1.

Zelenskyy announced his war plan in his nightly address on Monday, saying it’s 90% ready and will be presented to allies over the next week.

He said Ukraine’s [plan for victory](https://apnews.com/video/ukraine-government-kyiv-volodymyr-zelenskyy-ukraine-war-and-unrest-be06ac55f33246fd96f1898bac5a6884)
 includes not only battlefield goals but also diplomatic and economic wins. The plan has been kept under wraps but the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said at a news conference Tuesday that Washington officials have seen it.

“We think it lays out a strategy and a plan that can work,” she said, adding that the United States will bring it up with other world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly in New York next week. She did not comment on what the plan contained.

Video shows explosions after drone attack on Russian ammunition depot

00:58

CNN  — 

A Ukrainian drone attack launched overnight destroyed an ammunition depot in the western Russian region of Tver, a source from Ukraine’s Security Service (SBU) told CNN on Wednesday, causing a massive blast.

The Ukrainian drones targeted the Russian defense ministry-operated warehouse in the city of Toropets, which was storing Iskander tactical missile systems, Tochka-U tactical missile systems, guided aerial bombs and artillery ammunition, the source said.

Large fires broke out from the debris of drones repelled by local air defenses, the regional government said, prompting the governor, Igor Rudenya, to order a partial evacuation of the area during the early hours of Wednesday.

Earthquake monitors now believe explosions from the drone attack may have generated seismic activity. Ben Dando, a seismologist at the Norwegian seismology research foundation NORSAR, told CNN that its sensors “detected seismic signals, of magnitude 2.5 to 2.8, in northwest Russia which look to be associated with the drone attack launched by Ukraine.”

NORSAR, which has been using seismic monitors since 2022 to evaluate the impact of the war in Ukraine, is currently analyzing the preliminary data to capture the full extent of the blast, Dando added.

Satellite images taken by Maxar Technologies on Wednesday morning showed huge plumes of smoke rising up from several depot buildings, as well as extensive damage to the buildings and nearby forest.

Fires continue to burn, as seen in the Maxar Technologies images.

Russian state news agency TASS reported that a drone attack had been launched on the city of Toropets overnight causing a fire “due to the fall of debris,” without specifically mentioning any targeting of a weapons facility.

Videos circulating on social media, verified by CNN, showed loud detonations and multiple buildings in the depot complex on fire.

Affected residents, including 11 children, have already been evacuated to the settlements of Kunya and Velikiye Luki in the neighbouring Pskov region, TASS said. No civilians are thought to have been injured in the drone attack, the news agency reported, citing Rudenya.

“Now we are engaged in evacuating the population, residents, maintaining public order,” Rudenya said in a later video statement, stressing that multiple emergency service units were involved in the response.

Rudenya made the call to evacuate so emergency services at the scene could work fully to bring the blazes under control, the local government said in a post on its official Telegram channel.

The Ukrainian security source told CNN that attacks of this nature are being used “methodically” to reduce Russia’s missile potential, adding that plans for further attacks on “similar” Russian military facilities are “proceeding.”

Toropets is located around 300 miles from the Ukrainian border and about 250 miles west of Moscow.

Ukraine has been pushing its key allies, including the United States, to give the go-ahead to carry out missile strikes on targets deeper into Russian territory. Last week, Russian President Vladimir Putin [warned NATO members](https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/12/europe/putin-warns-nato-missiles-hnk-latam-intl/index.html)
 that lifting restrictions on Ukraine’s use of long-range missile systems would mean entering into war with Russia itself.
