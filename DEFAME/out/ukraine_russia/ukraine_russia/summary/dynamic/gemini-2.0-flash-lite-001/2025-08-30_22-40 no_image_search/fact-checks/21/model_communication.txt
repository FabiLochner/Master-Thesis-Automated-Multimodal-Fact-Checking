Mexican President-elect Claudia Sheinbaum has declined an invitation from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to visit Ukraine, reaffirming Mexico’s commitment to neutrality in international conflicts. 

Zelensky had extended the invitation, hoping for an official Mexican visit to witness the effects of Russia’s invasion. <image:439>

Mexico played an active role in the United Nations, joining other countries in condemning Russia’s actions and co-sponsoring a resolution urging a ceasefire and protection for Ukrainian civilians. "My main task is to rule in Mexico; I will attend certain international events, which we consider important, but we will not travel much - our responsibility lies here," she stated, pointing to Mexico’s long-standing neutral and pacifist stance in global conflicts.

! Zelensky also expressed his hope that Mexico, under Sheinbaum’s leadership, would clearly distance itself from Russia.

However, Sheinbaum, set to become Mexico’s first female president on October 1, firmly rejected the invitation. He expressed disappointment over Mexico's inclusion of Russian military personnel in its Independence Day parade and called for recognition of Ukraine’s struggle for independence. "Our Constitution is very clear, noble, and pacifist," she said.

Throughout his tenure, current President Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) maintained a balanced stance on the Ukraine conflict, condemning Russia’s invasion while criticising the US for sending arms to Ukraine. Mexico has also refused to impose sanctions on Russia and declined to send military aid to Ukraine, despite requests from Ukrainian officials.

Nevertheless, it has played an active role in the United Nations, joining other countries in condemning Russia’s actions and co-sponsoring a resolution urging a ceasefire and protection for Ukrainian civilians. Domestically, however, support for the Kremlin has surfaced within Mexico’s governing Morena party, with some leftist members forming a "Mexico-Russia Friendship Committee" shortly after the war began.

Sheinbaum indicated that her administration would continue to focus on internal affairs, echoing AMLO’s approach of limited international travel."

Mexico’s President-elect Claudia Sheinbaum declined an invitation from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to visit Kyiv after taking office on 1 October, Fuser News reports.

 her intention to maintain a policy of non-intervention in foreign affairs, continuing the approach of her predecessor Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.

Mexico maintains diplomatic relations with both Russia and Ukraine and adheres to a policy of neutrality regarding the war.

Mexico’s President-elect Claudia Sheinbaum. Sheinbaum referred to an incident at the Mexican embassy in Ecuador in April as a “violation of sovereignty.” According to [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mexico-invites-putin-presidential-inauguration-russias-izvestia-newspaper-says-2024-08-06/)
, Mexico invited Russian President Vladimir Putin to Sheinbaum’s inauguration ceremony on 1 October.

The Ukrainian embassy in Mexico has [called](https://euromaidanpress.com/2024/08/08/ukraine-calls-on-mexico-to-arrest-putin-during-mexican-presidents-inauguration/?swcfpc=1)
 on local authorities to detain Putin if he visits, as Mexico recognizes the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court (ICC). We will attend some international events that we consider important, but we will not travel much,”_ Sheinbaum said, emphasizing that her administration’s main task will be addressing domestic issues.

The President-elect reaffirmed Mexico’s commitment to maintaining diplomatic relations with all countries, with the exception of Ecuador. On 8 August, European Commission spokesperson Peter Stano said that the European Union had also urged Mexico to arrest Putin if he arrives in the country.

Mexico has rejected a request from Ukraine to arrest the Russian President if he attends the inauguration of Mexico’s next president on 1 October.

In March 2023, the ICC issued an arrest warrant for Putin on charges of abducting and forcibly deporting Ukrainian children to Russia. Since then, the Russian leader has avoided traveling to countries that have signed the Rome Statute due to the threat of arrest.

She added that Mexico maintains diplomatic relations with all countries except Ecuador, where an embassy attack in April was deemed a “violation of sovereignty.”

In August, Russian media reported that Mexico had invited Russian dictator Vladimir Putin to Sheinbaum’s inauguration on October 1, 2024.

The Ukrainian Embassy in Mexico has urged Mexican authorities to arrest Putin if he visits, citing his war crimes indictment by the International Criminal Court, which Mexico recognizes.

López Obrador had previously rejected Ukraine’s request to arrest Putin.

Content: "‘war on drugs’ as poison to Mexico.

Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum made this statement — “Start with your own country” — during her regular morning press conference Feb. In the cities of the United States, who sells the drugs that have wreaked such tragedy?”

President Sheinbaum knows what she is talking about, especially if one considers who the big winner is in the drug business. The secrets of drug trafficking, from Colombia to Chicago” — states that there are some 20 million drug users in the United States, of which some 6 million are addicts; however, it is dangerous to talk about the subject, so it is avoided, leading to total ignorance and confusion and the easy construction of stereotypes aimed at blaming the scourge exclusively on the producing countries.

Fernández Menéndez and Ronquillo explain that, after the shipments have crossed the border using all kinds of transport and also through tunnels along the entire border area, the drug trafficking networks begin to operate from 14 cities in the south in the states of New Mexico, Texas, California, Arizona, Oklahoma, Florida and Louisiana, where the drugs are smuggled. In the continuation of the controversy and in defense of Mexico’s best interests, three days later Sheinbaum reiterated that the United States must take responsibility for the serious problem of drug trafficking and drug consumption in its country.

The Mexican president explained that drug trafficking arises from the demand for drugs; as long as there is consumption, there will be supply. In this area, she insisted that the United States must also take charge of controlling its own generators of violence and domestic production of psychotropic substances and must make an effort to monitor and intervene in its illegal internal market.

It must also be said Claudia Sheinbaum showed her indomitable will and patriotic feeling in the conversation she had with the U.S. 7, Sheinbaum reported that she told Trump that it was crucial in the fight against drug trafficking that weapons from the U.S. But today, there are several countries and governments that support and defend the dignity and honor of their peoples.

Claudia Sheinbaum, just like the priests Miguel Hidalgo and José María Morelos, just like Benito Juárez and Lázaro Cárdenas, is giving continuity to policies to recover decorum and consciousness of Mexican sovereignty initiated in this century by Andrés Manuel López Obrador. government’s use of the “war on drugs” as a pretext for intervention and exposes inconsistencies in Washington’s propaganda. The Mexican president then said: “They have a lot to do in the United States,” and asked, “How does fentanyl or any other drug get there? Already at the end of the 20th century, a study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) estimated the profit produced by international drug trafficking at close to $500 billion, more than half of which circulated through the U.S."

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum [pointed that out last week](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mexican-president-tells-trump-tariffs-will-worsen-inflation-kill-jobs-2024-11-26/)
 in response to Trump’s claim that he’ll address this country’s fentanyl problem by putting a tariff on Mexican imports. 4, 2024, 6:06 PM EST

By [Julio Ricardo Varela](https://www.msnbc.com/author/julio-ricardo-varela-ncpn297186)
, MSNBC Columnist

Much of President-elect Donald Trump’s rise to power can be linked to [his blaming Mexico for America’s problems](https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-tariffs-mexico-president-claudia-sheinbaum-rcna181923)
. We do not consume synthetic drugs,” Sheinbaum said. When he launched his first presidential campaign in 2015, he claimed [Mexico was mostly “sending” criminals](https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/the-6-most-provocative-parts-donald-trumps-2016-announcement-msna619371)
, including drug dealers and rapists, to the U.S., and [he promised to build a wall](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-project-2025-immigration-mass-deportation-rcna179782)
 to keep migrants out. Now, his threat to [impose 25% tariffs on goods imported from Mexico and Canada](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-new-threats-day-one-trade-tariffs-matter-rcna181793)
 is based in part on the idea that Mexico is the cause of the United States’ fentanyl addiction and to blame for a migrant crisis.

Trump's talk of targeting Mexico is not only misguided, it’s downright reckless.

Trump's talk of targeting Mexico is not only misguided, it’s downright reckless. It riles up the nativism in his MAGA followers and gives them the scapegoat they crave.

But that ignores that the United States is the world’s most lucrative illegal drug market, [estimated at $150 billion yearly](https://www.rand.org/news/press/2019/08/20.html)
 for the most common drugs, along with an [increasing use of fentanyl](https://time.com/6977717/fentanyl-pills-seized-study/)
. “Unfortunately, what we do have is the people who are being killed by the crime that is responding to the demand in your country.”

Drugs aren’t the only thing that U.S. Mexico also has enforced new visa requirements for those from Brazil, Ecuador, and Venezuela, and increased expulsions.”

That all happened under then-Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, and his successor, Sheinbaum, [told Trump last week](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-mexico-president-sheinbaum-immigration-rcna182119)
 “that caravans weren’t arriving at the northern border because they are being served in Mexico.” In other words, Mexico continues to be the United States’ real southern border wall. This, despite Sheinbaum’s claim that “Mexico’s position is not to close borders but instead build bridges between government and people.” That might sound noble, but Mexico has benefited from being a complicit immigration enforcement partner with the U.S. That type of attitude led [to successes in decreasing drug fatalities](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-tariffs-overdose-opioid-epidemic-rcna182059)
 during the Biden administration."

United States President Donald Trump thanked Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum on Wednesday for giving him the idea to launch an anti-drugs campaign, on which he pledged to spend “hundreds of millions of dollars.”

[Speaking at a Saudi Arabia-backed investment conference in Miami](https://x.com/jenarovillamil/status/1892377901682589986?s=46)
, Trump said he had spoken to Sheinbaum about drugs and she told him that Mexico is not a “consumer nation.”

> [#ULTIMAHORA](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ULTIMAHORA?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)
> . — his “sweeping freeze on foreign aid has temporarily stopped U.S.-funded anti-narcotics programs in Mexico that for years have been working to curb the flow of the synthetic opioid into the United States,” [Reuters said in an exclusive report last week](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trumps-foreign-aid-freeze-stops-anti-fentanyl-work-mexico-2025-02-13/)
.

**‘Fentanyl kills’: Mexico’s anti-drug campaign**
-------------------------------------------------

In early January, [Sheinbaum officially presented a 300-million-peso (US $14.8 million) “national” and “permanent” anti-drugs campaign](https://www.gob.mx/presidencia/prensa/presidenta-claudia-sheinbaum-presenta-campana-preventiva-nacional-y-permanente-alejate-de-las-drogas-el-fentanilo-te-mata)
 under the name “Aléjate de las drogas. (CBP Troy Miller/X)

The government of former president Andrés Manuel López Obrador [also ran an anti-drugs campaign](https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/fruitless-anti-drug-abuse-campaign/)
, and in early 2023 then deputy health minister Hugo López-Gatell was [announced as Mexico’s new addiction prevention “czar.”](https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/lopez-gatell-addiction-czar/)

The current and former anti-drugs campaigns have [faced criticism for a range of reasons](https://politica.expansion.mx/mexico/2025/02/10/campana-fentanilo-por-presion-sin-politica-innovadora)
, including because of the focus on fentanyl, which — as Sheinbaum has pointed out — is not widely used in Mexico, and because they have allegedly aroused interest in the synthetic opioid among users of other drugs.

“The main drug problem in Mexico is the use of methamphetamines,” [the news website Expansión reported earlier this month](https://politica.expansion.mx/mexico/2025/02/10/campana-fentanilo-por-presion-sin-politica-innovadora)
.

Health Minister David Kershenobich said last month that was “probably” the case, although he said that fentanyl “is the most significant” drug used in Mexico “in the sense of mortality and the harm it causes.”

Have something to say? President Donald Trump, who said Sheinbaum inspired his new anti-drug campaign](https://mexiconewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/sheinbaum-trump-696x464.jpg "sheinbaum-trump")](https://mexiconewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/sheinbaum-trump.jpg)

Despite her status as 'the world's leading Trump whisperer,' President Sheinbaum and U.S. We have great family values,'” Trump said.

He noted that Sheinbaum — who he referred to as a “very wonderful woman” — also told him that Mexico spends a lot of money on anti-drug advertising.

“And I said ‘unbelievable.’ That was such a great conversation because we’re going to spend hundreds of millions of dollars advertising how bad drugs are so that kids don’t use them — \[we’re going to say\] that they chew up your brain, they destroy your teeth, your skin, your everything. … We’re going to do a great advertising campaign saying how bad it is, how drugs are so bad for you,” he said.

Trump didn’t say exactly when he spoke to Sheinbaum about Mexico’s anti-drug advertising campaign.

Sheinbaum [said on social media in late November](https://mexiconewsdaily.com/politics/sheinbaum-responds-trump-claim-stop-migration-close-border/)
 that she had spoken to Trump about “the campaign we’re carrying out in the country to prevent the use of fentanyl.”

The U.S. Stay away from drugs, choose to be happy,” [says one video advertisement](https://x.com/SSalud_mx/status/1890611998871704013/video/1)
.

On the day the “Stay away from drugs campaign” was officially launched, [Sheinbaum asserted that the use of fentanyl “is not really a problem” in Mexico](https://mexiconewsdaily.com/politics/mexico-sheinbaum-fentanyl/)
.

While [fentanyl is used in Mexico](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/fentanyl-use-spreads-deeper-into-mexico-worrying-authorities-2024-02-20/)
 and there have been deaths linked to the powerful synthetic opioid here, “there is not a crisis like there is in the United States,” she said.

“… We don’t want \[the overdose crisis\] to reach our country, and that’s why we’re starting this campaign against fentanyl,” Sheinbaum said.

On 13 September, Zelenskyy acknowledged the Russian counter-attack but claimed there had been "no serious (Russian) success", adding that "It gave the results that, frankly speaking, we counted on" and reiterated claims that it had adversely affected Russian operations in Kharkiv and Donetsk Oblasts.[\[332\]](#cite_note-334)
[\[333\]](#cite_note-335)
[\[187\]](#cite_note-ISW_2024_09_13-189)

### United States

 On 8 August, Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary [Sabrina Singh](/wiki/Sabrina_Singh "Sabrina Singh")

 On 12 August, [US National Security Council](/wiki/United_States_National_Security_Council "United States National Security Council")
 spokesperson [John Kirby](/wiki/John_Kirby_(admiral) "John Kirby (admiral)")

 On 13 August, President [Joe Biden](/wiki/Joe_Biden "Joe Biden")
 said that the Ukrainian incursion was "creating a real dilemma" for Putin.[\[337\]](#cite_note-339)

### Germany

In response to the Kursk offensive, the German Foreign Ministry stated on 9 August that weapons transferred from Germany to Ukraine become the property of Ukraine and can be used by its armed forces as they deem necessary and correct. It said "the absence of any significant military units of the Russian Federation on the border at the time of the attack and the simultaneous continuous conduct of aggressive military operations for more than 900 days on the territory of sovereign Ukraine is the best proof that Putin is lying again about 'protecting Russia.' He doesn't care about Russia, he is only protecting himself."[\[59\]](#cite_note-cnn-conscripts-61)

[NATO](/wiki/NATO "NATO")
 Secretary-General [Jens Stoltenberg](/wiki/Jens_Stoltenberg "Jens Stoltenberg")
 called the Ukrainian incursion "legitimate" and within Kyiv's right to self-defense, adding that the bloc did not receive prior information about the operation and did not play a role in it.[\[346\]](#cite_note-348)

### Evaluation of the offensive

The _BBC_ reported that the August 2024 offensive was the first incidence since [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II "World War II")
 that Russian territory had been occupied by foreign forces (although other sources state that foreign jihadists occupied some Russian territory during the [War in Dagestan](/wiki/War_in_Dagestan_(1999) "War in Dagestan (1999)")
 in 1999).[\[347\]](#cite_note-349)
[\[348\]](#cite_note-350)
 The incursion has been dubbed the "second battle of Kursk", in allusion to [the 1943 battle](/wiki/Battle_of_Kursk "Battle of Kursk")
 in the same region.[\[349\]](#cite_note-351)
[\[350\]](#cite_note-352)
 The offensive is also larger than earlier ground raids, with at least two [brigades](/wiki/Brigade "Brigade")
 from the regular Ukrainian forces participating. Finally, on the strategic level, to slow Russia's offensive momentum, to shift the narrative and counter Russian talking points about their inevitable victory, and also to boost Ukrainian morale.[\[355\]](#cite_note-357)

Matthew Savill, director of military sciences at the [Royal United Services Institute](/wiki/Royal_United_Services_Institute "Royal United Services Institute")
 (RUSI), said that the Ukrainian incursion into Russia was "the first on this scale with conventional forces, rather than proxies \[or\] 'resistance' groups." He also assessed that [earlier raids into Kursk and Belgorod](/wiki/March_2024_western_Russia_incursion "March 2024 western Russia incursion")
 were designed to probe for Russian weak spots, and that the overall goal of the raid is to dismantle Russia's ability to funnel more troops into the [Kharkiv front](/wiki/2024_Kharkiv_offensive "2024 Kharkiv offensive")
 and that "It's unlikely that the plan is to seriously take Kursk itself, or to try and hold vast swathes of Russian territory."[\[79\]](#cite_note-Politico_August_8-81)
 BBC journalists noted the overall decrease of Russian attacks on the Ukrainian frontline at around 15–17% after the beginning of Kursk raids, which could be the sign of Russia taking forces from the frontline into Kursk Oblast.[\[356\]](#cite_note-358)

[Nico Lange](/wiki/Nico_Lange "Nico Lange")
, former chief of staff at the German [Federal Ministry of Defence](/wiki/Federal_Ministry_of_Defence_(Germany) "Federal Ministry of Defence (Germany)")
, stated that the incursion was likely "to establish a [negotiating position](/wiki/Ukraine%27s_Peace_Formula "Ukraine's Peace Formula")
 and provide relief on other front lines" and that it is unlikely that Ukrainian forces would hold territory in Kursk for long periods of time.[\[79\]](#cite_note-Politico_August_8-81)
 Retired Polish General and former commander of special forces, [Roman Polko](/wiki/Roman_Polko "Roman Polko")
, stated that "It's good that Ukraine is taking actions that surprise the Russians," and that "Ukraine is in a defensive position and is unable to conduct an operation to push Russia from the occupied regions, but Ukraine is defending itself in an active way," and that "One can't allow the Russians to comfortably prepare new attacks."[\[79\]](#cite_note-Politico_August_8-81)

Political analyst [Andreas Umland](/wiki/Andreas_Umland "Andreas Umland")
 suggested that the offensive could bring a quicker end to the war. Kiviselg said that the Russian counterattack in Kursk had "not made significant progress" and had suffered losses, but speculated that the Russian movement may have simply been a probing attack and not the main offensive effort.[\[366\]](#cite_note-368)

By 2 October 2024, nearly two months since the incursion, it was widely agreed that the operation in Kursk had a direct relation with the degradation of Ukraine's eastern front.[\[46\]](#cite_note-AlexHorton-48)
 Ukraine suffered its steepest loss in territory between mid-August to mid-September, which also coincided with Ukraine's incursion into Kursk according to Pasi Paroinen, analyst of the Black Bird Group.[\[46\]](#cite_note-AlexHorton-48)
 Rob Lee further supported his earlier argument, stressing that Kursk had stretched Ukrainian personnel thin, added pressure on units holding the line and exacerbated the manpower issues in Ukraine, which is further made worse with heavy losses of experienced Ukrainian soldiers, coupled with new troops sped to the front with limited training.[\[46\]](#cite_note-AlexHorton-48)

By 20 November 2024, three months into the incursion, Marina Miron, a defence researcher at [King's College London](/wiki/King%27s_College_London "King's College London")
, declared the entire operation to be a costly, strategic failure for Ukraine. Kofman assessed that by early February 2025, the salient created by the offensive had become impossible to hold as Russia had increasingly been able to hinder the use of supply routes.[\[13\]](#cite_note-kursk_gambit_20250401-14)
[\[368\]](#cite_note-370)
 According to another military analyst, Steen Kjærgaard, the US cutting intelligence sharing with Ukraine on 5 March played a major role in Russians retaking Sudzha, with Ukraine lacking information on Russian troop movements.[\[369\]](#cite_note-d947-371)
 Richard Kemp from _[The Telegraph](/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph "The Daily Telegraph")
_ viewed the entire Kursk operation to be a defeat for Ukraine, as Ukraine had lost any "bargaining chip" to trade land for land in any ceasefire negotiations.[\[370\]](#cite_note-Telegraph-372)
 Former military advisor [Nico Lange](/wiki/Nico_Lange "Nico Lange")
 viewed the operation as a success.[\[371\]](#cite_note-:0-373)
 Nick Reynolds, a land warfare expert with the [Royal United Services Institute](/wiki/Royal_United_Services_Institute "Royal United Services Institute")
 said that he hesitated to say that the effort by Ukraine was a strategic mistake, that Ukraine had held the Sudzha pocket for a "remarkable" amount of time, and that the Ukrainian offensive had had a "shaping effect on Russian thinking".[\[45\]](#cite_note-guardian_20250310-47)
 On 26 April 2025, the ISW said that the Ukrainian operation succeeded in diverting some Russian "elite" units from Donbas, but its long-term effects remain to be seen.[\[372\]](#cite_note-374)

The attack reportedly pushed up [natural gas prices](/wiki/Natural_gas_prices "Natural gas prices")

Nearly 200,000 civilians in Russia were displaced by the fighting.[\[381\]](#cite_note-383)
 Some of the displaced were to be moved to Russian-occupied parts of [Zaporizhzhia Oblast](/wiki/Zaporizhzhia_Oblast "Zaporizhzhia Oblast")

 Some Russian civilians in the territory under Ukrainian occupation complained in August that they had been abandoned by the Russian government.[\[383\]](#cite_note-385)
 On 8 August, Putin pledged that the government would provide financial assistance of 10,000 rubles ($100) to those displaced by the fighting."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms the existence of the Kursk offensive in August 2024, as stated in the claim. The provided web sources detail the campaign's timeline, involved parties, and impact.

However, the evidence does not mention any chemical attacks during the Kursk offensive. The image's geolocation data is inconclusive, with Russia having a low probability.

Therefore, the claim that the image depicts a chemical attack by the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the Kursk offensive in August 2024 cannot be verified due to the lack of evidence.

 of video was circulated online at the beginning of March with the caption: “For those feeling sorry for Volodymyr Zelensky, here’s the Ukrainian President signing bombs to be dropped on innocent Gazans”. Zelensky signing bombs that killed Palestinian women and children”.

* * *

### **METHOD**

The video of Zelenskyy and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro signing artillery shells began to circulate online following an eventful meeting at the White House between Zelenskyy, President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance on February 28 which turned into a near-shouting match.

Video caption falsely claims Zelenskyy signed bombs for Gaza

 \[Accessed 13 Mar. During the meeting, Trump told Zelenskyy to make a deal with Russia to end the war in Ukraine. He also told Zelenskyy he was “[gambling with World War III](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/28/trump-vance-zelenskyy-oval-office-exchange-00206727)
”.

A reverse Google Image search of a screen shot from the video however revealed that it was published several months before the fateful White House meeting.

Governor Josh Shapiro shared the video on September 23, 2024, with a caption referencing Ukraine’s war with Russia. This version allowed us to see that Zelenskyy wrote “Glory to Ukraine” on one shell and “Thanks for Support” on another, both referencing Ukraine’s war with Russia and not Israel’s war in Gaza.

[Information](https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/prezident-vidvidav-skrentonskij-armijskij-boyepripasnij-zavo-93389)
 about Zelenskyy’s visit to the ammunition factory, as well as details on its operations, was provided on Ukraine’s official government website.

“The plant’s capacity is fully dedicated to meeting Ukraine’s needs, particularly for the production of 155mm shells, which has significantly increased over the past year,” the statement read.

A statement regarding the visit was also released on the U.S. Army [website](https://www.army.mil/article/279911/ukrainian_president_zelenskyy_tours_scranton_army_ammunition_plant)
 which confirmed the factory was being used to bolster Ukraine’s ammunition stockpile.

### **RATING**

The video shows Zelenskyy visiting a munitions factory that produces armaments for the Ukrainian Security and Defense Forces, not Israel. It was published five months before the February 2025 meeting and a longer version of the video reveals that Zelenskyy’s handwritten messages do not reference Ukraine’s war with Russia or Israel’s war in Gaza.

"We stand with Ukraine in their just defense of their homeland in the face of Russian aggression."

However, response from the right was brisk – with conservative commentator David Harris Jr. (AP Photo)

"Zelenskyy just essentially endorsed Kamala in Pennsylvania while with Josh Shapiro autographing ammunition," wrote Philadelphia commentator Joey Mannarino on X.

"He called Trump and Vance ‘radical’. – locked in a tight re-election race with businessman David McCormick – was seen shaking hands with Zelenskyy as Shapiro wrote a message on the missile.

Other critics pointed out that chaos was erupting elsewhere in the commonwealth while Shapiro, Zelenskyy and Casey were touring the ordnance plant.

In an official statement, Shapiro said Pennsylvania is the "birthplace of American freedom" and Pennsylvanians therefore stand with Ukrainians in their fight against "naked aggression."

He also noted Pennsylvania will sign an agreement with the Ukrainian state of Zaporizhizhia that will "foster collaboration for years to come."

 that the pact will "help support the future economic revitalization of Ukraine, while boosting our economy and creating jobs for Pennsylvanians."

Zelenskyy's "Glory to Ukraine" inscription on US bombs in Pennsylvania stirs controversy
========================================================================================

15 October 2024 18:57

**Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's recent visit to Pennsylvania has stirred significant controversy, raising questions about the intersection of foreign diplomacy and US electoral politics.** 

During a tour aimed at bolstering support for Ukraine, Zelenskyy made headlines after signing munitions at the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant, a move that has elicited mixed reactions from both local residents and political leaders, **[Caliber.Az](https://caliber.az/en)
** reports, **[citing](https://www.politico.eu/article/polish-american-lean-donald-trump-despite-ukraine-war-dupont-pennsylvania/)** Politico.

While at the plant, Zelenskyy inscribed messages of gratitude on US bombs, including the phrase “Glory to Ukraine.” Democratic Governor Josh Shapiro, who was present during the signing, appeared supportive of the gesture. “Because you’re signing bombs that could potentially kill innocent people.

!loading <image:3679> There’s innocent on both sides.”

The backlash against Zelenskyy’s visit was further amplified by political commentators and Republican leaders. Reports indicate that Zelenskyy’s remarks about the Republican candidate for US vice president, whom he labeled as radical, only fueled this perception.

Senator Lindsey Graham, a prominent Republican figure, also condemned Zelenskyy's presence at the military plant, asserting that such actions could jeopardize Ukraine’s long-term objectives in its fight against Russia. “We need to ensure that incidents like this do not detract from the long-term goals of ensuring success for Ukraine,” Graham remarked.

Volodymyr Zelensky (left) and Joe Biden said they would focus on Ukraine's "victory plan" at their White House talks

Volodymyr Zelensky is meeting Joe Biden and Kamala Harris at the White House to discuss his "victory plan", which the Ukrainian president hopes will pressure Russia into agreeing a diplomatic end to the war.

Details have been kept secret, but Zelensky is likely to ask the US president and vice-president for continuing military and financial support, as well as security guarantees.

It comes amid a row with Donald Trump and the Republican party ahead of November's US presidential election.

They were angered by Zelensky's visit to an arms factory in Biden's hometown of Scranton with top Democrats. Zelensky will meet Trump on Friday despite earlier reports that the meeting had been cancelled.

Zelensky's visit to the ammunition factory in the key swing state of Pennsylvania was labelled by leading Republicans as a partisan campaign event.

In a public letter, speaker of the US House Mike Johnson said the visit was "designed to help Democrats" and claimed it amounted to "election interference".

He also demanded that Ukraine fire its ambassador to Washington who helped arrange the visit.

The Republican-led House Oversight Committee has also announced it would investigate whether Zelensky's trip was an attempt to use a foreign leader to benefit Harris's campaign.

Her Republican rival for the presidency, Donald Trump, mocked Zelensky at a campaign event as the "greatest salesman on Earth" and accused him of refusing to "make a deal" with Moscow.

Earlier this week, Trump also praised Russia's military capabilities, saying: "They beat Hitler, they beat Napoleon - that’s what they do, they fight."

The two men have long had a fractious relationship. In 2019, Trump was impeached by the US House over accusations that he pressured Ukraine's leader to dig up damaging information on a political rival.

The row clouded a week in which Zelensky has twice addressed the United Nations, ramping up efforts to persuade the US and other allies to boost support more than two and a half years into Russia's full-scale invasion.

At the White House meetings, Zelensky is expected to push again for US backing to fire Western-made long-range missiles deep into Russian territory, which Biden has so far blocked.

Before the meeting, Biden said: "Let me be clear, Russia will not prevail in war... Ukraine will prevail".

He also pledged to support Kyiv "in its path to membership to both the EU and Nato".

Meanwhile, Zelensky thanked the US for its "unwavering bipartisan support".

He later met Harris, with the vice-president reiterating her support for Ukraine and arguing the US must continue its role of global leadership.

With Russian troops advancing in the east of Ukraine, the outcome of Zelensky's meeting with Biden and Harris is seen by many experts as a key moment in his attempt to shore up US support before the November election.

On Wednesday, Russia's Vladimir Putin announced a plan to revise Moscow's nuclear doctrine, to enable Russia to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states if they are supported by nuclear states.

Putin's spokesperson later clarified that it was meant as a "specific signal" to the West.

President Volodymyr Zelensky visited the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant alongside top Democrats on Friday

Hours before his meeting with Zelensky, Biden announced a $7.9bn (£5.9bn) package of military assistance to Ukraine.

The aid, part of a $61bn package that passed Congress in April, will be approved through presidential drawdown authority and will pull from existing Pentagon supplies to deliver the arms more quickly.

Congressional Republicans blocked the package for months earlier this year, before ultimately relenting and passing the legislation. The delay caused arms supplies to Ukraine to dry up for several months.

Zelensky thanked the US - Ukraine's largest foreign donor.

At the same time, he also reportedly expressed frustration at the delay in delivering weapons that were already promised when he met US congressmen on Thursday morning.

**Volodymyr Zelensky is meeting Joe Biden and Kamala Harris at the White House to discuss his "victory plan", which the Ukrainian president hopes will pressure Russia into agreeing a diplomatic end to the war.**

Details have been kept secret, but Zelensky is likely to ask the US president and vice-president for continuing military and financial support, as well as security guarantees.

It comes amid a row with Donald Trump and the Republican party ahead of November's US presidential election.

They were angered by Zelensky's visit to an arms factory in Biden's hometown of Scranton with top Democrats. Zelensky will meet Trump on Friday despite earlier reports that the meeting had been cancelled.

Zelensky's visit to the ammunition factory in the key swing state of Pennsylvania was labelled by leading Republicans as a partisan campaign event.

In a public letter, speaker of the US House Mike Johnson said the visit was "designed to help Democrats" and claimed it amounted to "election interference".

He also demanded that Ukraine fire its ambassador to Washington who helped arrange the visit.

The Republican-led House Oversight Committee has also announced it would investigate whether Zelensky's trip was an attempt to use a foreign leader to benefit Harris's campaign.

Her Republican rival for the presidency, Donald Trump, mocked Zelensky at a campaign event as the "greatest salesman on Earth" and accused him of refusing to "make a deal" with Moscow.

Earlier this week, Trump also praised Russia's military capabilities, saying: "They beat Hitler, they beat Napoleon - that’s what they do, they fight."

The two men have long had a fractious relationship. In 2019, Trump was impeached by the US House over accusations that he pressured Ukraine's leader to dig up damaging information on a political rival.

The row clouded a week in which Zelensky has twice addressed the United Nations, ramping up efforts to persuade the US and other allies to boost support more than two and a half years into Russia's full-scale invasion.

At the White House meetings, Zelensky is expected to push again for US backing to fire Western-made long-range missiles deep into Russian territory, which Biden has so far blocked.

Before the meeting, Biden said: "Let me be clear, Russia will not prevail in war... Ukraine will prevail".

He also pledged to support Kyiv "in its path to membership to both the EU and Nato".

Meanwhile, Zelensky thanked the US for its "unwavering bipartisan support".

He later met Harris, with the vice-president reiterating her support for Ukraine and arguing the US must continue its role of global leadership.

With Russian troops advancing in the east of Ukraine, the outcome of Zelensky's meeting with Biden and Harris is seen by many experts as a key moment in his attempt to shore up US support before the November election.

On Wednesday, Russia's Vladimir Putin announced a plan to revise Moscow's nuclear doctrine, to enable Russia to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states if they are supported by nuclear states.

Putin's spokesperson later clarified that it was meant as a "specific signal" to the West.

Hours before his meeting with Zelensky, Biden announced a $7.9bn (£5.9bn) package of military assistance to Ukraine.

The aid, part of a $61bn package that passed Congress in April, will be approved through presidential drawdown authority and will pull from existing Pentagon supplies to deliver the arms more quickly.

Congressional Republicans blocked the package for months earlier this year, before ultimately relenting and passing the legislation. The delay caused arms supplies to Ukraine to dry up for several months.

Zelensky thanked the US - Ukraine's largest foreign donor.

At the same time, he also reportedly expressed frustration at the delay in delivering weapons that were already promised when he met US congressmen on Thursday morning.

What was [Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky](https://nypost.com/2024/09/25/us-news/house-gop-accuses-kamala-harris-of-using-zelensky-as-campaign-surrogate-launches-foreign-interference-inquiry/)
 doing at what sure _looked_ like a partisan US political event this week?

And how did the White House let this happen?

Zelensky got flown into battleground Pennsylvania aboard a USAF C-17 plane on Tuesday; he then toured the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant accompanied by Gov. Josh Shapiro, Sen. Bob Casey, Rep. Matt Cartwright — the last two being active Democratic candidates.

And it looks like no GOP candidates got invited — trapping a foreign head of state into apparently taking sides in US domestic politics.

Yet Zelensky was guarded by Secret Service agents and driven around in Secret Service vehicles, adding more reek of impropriety: Who covered those expenses?

Someone in the Biden administration pulled a fast one: Pennsylvania has a fair number of anti-Russian Polish-Americans and others of Eastern European heritage who might be swayed by Zelensky’s seeming preference.

Legalities aside, this is terrible for Zelensky: Ukraine desperately needs support from Republicans as well as Democrats in Congress, and will no matter who holds the White House next year.

House Speaker Mike Johnson is calling on Zelensky to fire his US ambassador for letting this disgrace happen, a move that could mend _Ukraine’s_ fences here.

But Congress will need answers on the American side, too: After all, Democrats impeached President Donald Trump over _his_ supposed abuses linked to Ukraine; now we have the misuse of a foreign guest’s visit to influence US politics.

We absolutely endorse US support of Kyiv against Moscow’s brutal invasion: Vladimir Putin must not succeed.

And Democratic candidates have every right to slam those Republicans who want to hang Ukraine out to dry.

But dragging any foreign leader, _especially_ one who’s seeking now new support for his nation from the White House, into US politics is morally criminal — at least.

Whether at the White House or the State Department, _American_ heads need to roll over this."

BERLIN, Feb 14 (Reuters) - There must be no peace in Ukraine over the heads of Ukrainians and Europeans, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said on Friday at the start of the Munich Security Conference.

"A sham peace - over the heads of Ukrainians and Europeans - would gain nothing," Baerbock said in a statement. Treasury Department on Wednesday announced sanctions on assets of four individuals whom it linked to Mexico-based Cartel del Noreste, including the popular hip-hop artist El Makabelico.

The comment comes after U.S. President Donald Trump startled U.S. This requires tough and long-term security guarantees for Ukraine, a strong NATO and progress in Ukraine's accession negotiations with the European Union," she said.

Content: "That followed a meeting between Zelenskyy and the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, who had visited Kyiv to discuss US access to rare earth minerals, energy resources and energy assets, according to Reuters.

The US has suggested that it would seek access to [rare earth minerals](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/05/donald-trump-rare-earths-ukraine-us-trade-deal-aid-russia)
, which are strategic metals essential for industries developing computers, batteries and cutting-edge energy technology in exchange for providing military aid to Ukraine in the future.

The rapid developments have worried Europe that Putin and Trump appear to be negotiating the future of the continent’s security over the heads of the Europeans themselves.

“If Europe is responsible for Ukraine’s security and could even provide troops \[under a ceasefire agreement\], then we should have a seat at the table and be consulted with the Americans,” said one European official. Our priority right now is to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position.”

Trump’s announcement followed a prisoner swap involving [Marc Fogel,](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/11/russia-us-prisoner-trump-marc-fogel)
 a US teacher who was arrested in Moscow on drug charges, and Alexander Vinnik, who was arrested in 2017 in Greece on cryptocurrency fraud charges and then extradited to the US.

The deal was arranged by Steve Witkoff, Trump’s envoy to the Middle East, one of the president’s closest allies on the team that will lead negotiations with the Russians.

The US negotiating team would include the secretary of state, Marco Rubio; the director of the CIA, John Ratcliffe; the national security adviser, Michael Waltz; and Witkoff.

Notable for his absence from the negotiating team was Gen Keith Kellogg, whom Trump had earlier named his special envoy to Ukraine and Russia and who was in the process of meeting with European leaders to discuss the upcoming negotiations.

Yet few were convinced he spoke directly for Trump, and he offered few concrete details beyond his “deep faith” that Trump was the best person to negotiate the deal, one official said.

Trump says he has spoken to Putin and agreed to negotiate Ukraine ceasefire
===========================================================================

This article is more than 5 months old

US secretary of defence Pete Hegseth says Ukraine would have to cede territory, alarming Kyiv and European allies

[Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump)
 has said that he and [Vladimir Putin](https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin)
 have agreed to begin negotiations to broker a ceasefire in Ukraine, later adding that it was unlikely Kyiv would win back all its territory or join Nato if a deal is to be reached.

Trump said that he was “OK” with [Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine)
 not having Nato membership and that it was “unlikely” that Ukraine would take much land back in the negotiations.

Russia “took a lot of land, and they fought for that land and they lost a lot of soldiers”, he told reporters later in the Oval Office.

Trump said he was not closely concerned with which territories were handed over.

“I’m just here to try and get peace,” he said. We agreed to work together, very closely, including visiting each other’s Nations.”

[US no longer ‘primarily focused’ on Europe’s security, says Pete Hegseth\

The Kremlin confirmed the call and the mutual invitations for the leaders to visit each other’s countries in what would be the first visits by an American president to Russia since 2009 and the first by Putin to the US since 2015.

In its readout, the Kremlin also maintained a maximalist position, with Putin saying he “mentioned the need to eliminate the root causes of the conflict and agreed with Trump that a long-term settlement could be achieved through peaceful negotiations”.

Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy – at least in public – offered support for the talks on Wednesday, saying he and Trump had held a “meaningful” conversation by phone. As President Trump said, let’s get it done.”

'I don't think it's practical': Trump on Nato membership for Ukraine – video

Trump told reporters that the US would seek to “secure” future military aid against Ukrainian rare earth minerals and other natural resources.

Trump said he was not concerned about freezing out Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy of the talks, saying: “I don’t think so as long as he’s there.”

But, he said, “sometime \[Ukraine’s\] going to have to have elections too … His poll numbers aren’t particularly great.”

Trump said Zelenskyy would meet on Friday with the vice-president, JD Vance, and the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, on the sidelines of the Munich security conference.

Earlier on Wednesday, the US negotiating position was outlined in Brussels, where secretary of defence Pete Hegseth delivered public remarks that [Kyiv must acknowledge that it cannot win back all the land occupied by Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/12/us-no-longer-primarily-focused-on-europes-security-says-pete-hegseth)
.

“We must start by recognising that returning to Ukraine’s pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic objective,” Hegseth said, sketching out an initial position for any peace negotiations with Russia.

“Chasing this illusory goal will only prolong the war and cause more suffering,” he added, though this could be interpreted as in effect acknowledging the annexation of Crimea, and large parts of the Donbas, by Russia.

Kyiv would only achieve peace through “robust security guarantees”, but Hegseth ruled out Nato membership for Ukraine. The German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said that Ukraine’s interests must be protected in the upcoming negotiations between Moscow and Washington. “I don’t care so much about anything other than I want to stop having millions of people killed.”

The rapid entry into negotiations with Russia and open demands that Ukraine concede land will have set alarm bells ringing in Kyiv and among its European allies that the Trump administration will offer minimal resistance to Putin’s demands in order to cut a deal as quickly as possible.

In a social media post, Trump said he held a “lengthy and highly productive phone call” with Putin and that they agreed to “have our respective teams start negotiations immediately”.

He said that he and Putin had agreed to visit each other’s countries, later telling reporters that their first meeting would take place in Saudi Arabia.

“As we both agreed, we want to stop the millions of deaths taking place in the War with Russia/Ukraine,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. That includes much of eastern Europe, including Poland and the Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia.

In December, Putin also stated that he would insist on Ukraine adopting a neutral status and implementing some degree of demilitarisation, while also demanding that the west lift its sanctions on Russia.

Kyiv has rejected those demands in the past and the Biden administration had said that it would be up to Ukraine to decide when to hold peace talks.

Earlier this week, [Zelenskyy told the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/11/zelenskyy-europe-cannot-guarantee-ukraines-security-without-america)
 that Europe was not able to offer resilient security guarantees to Kyiv without the involvement of the US. So we must accept this and figure out what we can do.”

Another senior European diplomat called the US position outlined by Hegseth a premature surrender, asking what there would be left to negotiate. The French foreign minister, Jean Noël-Barrot, called for Europe’s direct participation in the talks, saying that there “will be no just and lasting peace in Ukraine without the participation of Europeans”.

A spokesperson for the British foreign office expressed support for Trump’s desire to bring the war to an end, but added: “Russia could do this tomorrow by withdrawing its forces and ending its illegal invasion."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
In February 2025, Reuters published an article stating that German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said there must be no peace in Ukraine over the heads of Ukrainians and Europeans (<image:k>). The Guardian reported on February 12, 2025, that Baerbock said Ukraine’s interests must be protected in the upcoming negotiations regarding a ceasefire between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin (<image:1007>). A Wikipedia article mentions that Baerbock said Trump's conduct represented a "new era of ruthlessness" (<image:i>).

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that in February 2025, Annalena Baerbock commented on Donald Trump's actions and statements regarding Ukraine. However, the provided sources do not mention Baerbock threatening the US with severing ties.

The Reuters article states that Baerbock emphasized that there should be no peace in Ukraine without the involvement of Ukrainians and Europeans. The Guardian reported that Baerbock wanted to protect Ukraine's interests in the upcoming negotiations between Trump and Putin. A Wikipedia article mentions that Baerbock described Trump's conduct as a "new era of ruthlessness".

The claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence. The evidence does not support the assertion that Baerbock threatened to sever ties with the US.


## Final Judgement
The search results confirm that Annalena Baerbock made statements regarding Donald Trump and Ukraine in February 2025. However, the provided evidence does not support the claim that Baerbock threatened the US with severing ties.

The claim is not supported by the evidence. The search results show Baerbock's comments on the situation, but not a threat to sever ties. Therefore, the claim is demonstrably false. `false`

CNN  — 

President Donald Trump said negotiations to end the Ukraine war will start “immediately” after holding a “lengthy and highly productive” telephone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday morning.

The call, which is the first known conversation between the presidents since Trump assumed office last month, came as as Trump makes clear to his advisers he wants to bring the Ukraine conflict to a swift end.

Trump administration officials said they hoped [a prisoner “exchange”](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/11/politics/marc-fogel-released-russia-trump/index.html)
 on Tuesday could portend renewed efforts to end the war, which is about to enter its fourth year.

Now, as the two leaders resume communication after a long period of silence between the White House and Kremlin, the contours of Trump’s settlement plan are coming into clearer focus.

In a readout of the conversation posted on Truth Social, Trump said, “We discussed Ukraine, the Middle East, Energy, Artificial Intelligence, the power of the Dollar, and various other subjects.”

“We agreed to work together, very closely, including visiting each other’s Nations. We have also agreed to have our respective teams start negotiations immediately, and we will begin by calling President Zelenskyy, of Ukraine, to inform him of the conversation, something which I will be doing right now,” Trump wrote.

Both Washington and Moscow, in their descriptions of the call, suggested the men assumed a conciliatory tone.

“President Putin even used my very strong Campaign motto of, ‘COMMON SENSE.’ We both believe very strongly in it,” Trump wrote, suggesting the former KGB agent on the other end of the line had chosen his words carefully to appeal to the US leader.

The Kremlin said Trump and Putin spoke for nearly 90 minutes.

Trump had been signaling for weeks his desire to speak with Putin as he works to resolve the Ukraine conflict.

As American officials travel in Europe this week, they have begun taking clearer positions on how the conclusion of the Ukraine war might look. Speaking to a conference in Brussels, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Kyiv joining NATO is unrealistic and that the US will no longer prioritize European and Ukrainian security as the Trump administration shifts its attention to securing US borders and deterring war with China.

Meanwhile, Trump has spoken of striking a deal with Ukraine’s Zelensky for American access to the country’s valuable rare earth minerals as payment for continued American assistance.

Trump spoke with Zelensky midday, shortly after getting off the phone with Putin.

His predecessor, President Joe Biden, hadn’t spoken to his Russian counterpart in nearly three years, believing there was little to be gained in speaking to a leader he’d deemed a war criminal.

The last US president to visit Russia was Barack Obama in 2013, when he attended a G20 summit. Putin last visited in the United States in 2015 to attend United Nations talks.

Later on Wednesday, Trump indicated that he could soon meet with Putin in Saudi Arabia but cautioned that no formal decision has been made on the matter.

“We think we’re going to probably meet in Saudi Arabia, the first meeting,” Trump said, hours after the two spoke by phone.

The president indicated that Saudi Arabian leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman would play a role in the discussions, saying, “We know the crown prince, and I think it’d be a very good place to be.”

A date for that meeting, Trump said, “hasn’t been set,” but he said it could be in the “not too distant future.”

Trump added he has not yet committed to go to Ukraine.

Asked whether Zelensky would be in attendance when he meets with Putin, Trump appeared to suggest he would not be present for the initial meeting: “Probably we’ll have a first meeting and then we’ll see what we can do about the second meeting.”

“I would think about going, I’d think about it, no problem,” he said.

Steve Witkoff, who will be among Trump’s top negotiators on the conflict, pointed earlier Wednesday to the release of wrongfully detained American Marc Fogel as “an indication of what the possibilities are” for the future of Russia’s war in Ukraine.

“I think that’s maybe a sign about how that working relationship between President Trump and President Putin will be in the future, and what that may portend for the world at large, for conflict and so forth. I think they had a great friendship, and I think now it’s going to continue, and it’s a really good thing for the world,” he said.

Witkoff met privately with Putin while in Moscow on Tuesday, two sources familiar with the meeting told CNN.

WASHINGTON/MOSCOW/KYIV, Feb 12 (Reuters) - [Donald Trump](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/donald-trump/)
 said both Russian President [Vladimir Putin](https://www.reuters.com/world/putin/)
 and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy expressed a desire for peace in separate phone calls with him on Wednesday, and Trump ordered top U.S. officials to begin talks on ending the [war in Ukraine](https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraine-russia-war/)
.

The conversations came after Trump's defense secretary earlier said Kyiv would have to give up its long-held goals of joining the NATO military alliance and regaining all of its territory seized by Russia, signaling a dramatic shift in Washington's approach to the conflict.

After speaking with Putin for more than an hour, Trump said the Russian leader, who launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, wants the war to end and they discussed "getting a ceasefire in the not-too-distant future."

"He wants it to end. Trump's predecessor, Joe Biden, oversaw billions of dollars of military and other aid to Kyiv and had no direct contact with Putin after Russia's invasion.

Russia occupies around a fifth of Ukraine and has demanded Kyiv cede more territory and be rendered permanently neutral under any peace deal.

'ILLUSIONARY GOAL'
------------------

Earlier on Wednesday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth delivered the new administration's bluntest statement so far on its approach to the war, saying Kyiv could not realistically hope to return to [previous borders](/world/europe/us-defense-chief-hegseth-says-return-ukraines-pre-2014-borders-not-realistic-2025-02-12/)
 or join NATO.

"We want, like you, a sovereign and prosperous Ukraine. troops would not be deployed to Ukraine as part of such guarantees.

Zelenskiy, hoping to keep Trump interested in continuing to support his country, has lately proposed a deal under which the United States would invest in minerals in Ukraine.

Trump's Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, in Kyiv on Wednesday on the first visit by a member of Trump's cabinet, said such a mineral deal could serve as a ["security shield"](/markets/commodities/top-trump-official-kyiv-discuss-deal-minerals-energy-2025-02-12/)
 for Ukraine after the war.

Trump also said Rubio and Vice President JD Vance will hold talks about the war on Friday in Munich, where Ukrainian officials were expected to attend an annual security conference.

The new diplomacy followed a U.S.-Russia prisoner swap that got under way on Tuesday, which the Kremlin said could help build trust between the two countries.

Russia on Tuesday freed American schoolteacher Marc Fogel, who was serving a 14-year sentence in a Russian prison, [in exchange](/world/europe/russia-says-its-getting-back-prisoner-us-return-freeing-teacher-marc-fogel-2025-02-12/)
 for a Russian cybercrime boss imprisoned in the U.S., according to a official.

Trump has long said he would quickly end the war in Ukraine, without spelling out exactly how he would accomplish this.

The Kremlin earlier said Putin and Trump had agreed to meet, and Putin had invited Trump to visit Moscow. Trump said their first meeting would "probably" take place soon in Saudi Arabia.

In a post on his social media platform, he said Secretary of State Marco Rubio, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, national security adviser Michael Waltz and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff would lead negotiations on ending the war.

Trump and Zelenskiy spoke after Trump's call with Putin, and Zelenskiy's office said the conversation lasted for about an hour.

"I had a meaningful conversation with @POTUS. He speaks fluent Russian.

Initially, the known number of Ukrainian military casualties varied widely due to the Ukrainian Army drastically understating its casualties,[\[19\]](#cite_note-hides-22)
 as reported by medics, activists and soldiers on the ground, as well as at least one lawmaker.[\[19\]](#cite_note-hides-22)
[\[20\]](#cite_note-23)
[\[21\]](#cite_note-24)
[\[22\]](#cite_note-25)
 Several medical officials reported they were overstretched due to the drastic number of casualties.[\[19\]](#cite_note-hides-22)
 Eventually, the [Ukrainian Defence Ministry](/wiki/Ministry_of_Defence_(Ukraine) "Ministry of Defence (Ukraine)")
 stated that the numbers recorded by the National Museum of Military History were the official ones, although still incomplete,[\[23\]](#cite_note-26)
 with 4,638 deaths (4,500 identified and 138 unidentified) cataloged by 1 December 2021.[\[10\]](#cite_note-memory0-11)
[\[b\]](#cite_note-"memory1-15)

According to the [Armed Forces of Ukraine](/wiki/Armed_Forces_of_Ukraine "Armed Forces of Ukraine")
, 1,175 of the Ukrainian servicemen died due to non-combat causes by 5 March 2021.[\[24\]](#cite_note-27)
 Subsequently, the military did not publish new figures on their non-combat losses, stating they could be considered a state secret.[\[25\]](#cite_note-28)

Faced with mounting losses in Ukraine, the Russian authorities moved quickly to decide how the deaths of soldiers would be reported. **Russian losses in the war with Ukraine.**  
Mediazona count, updated
======================================================================

_Mediazona,_ in collaboration with _BBC News_ Russian service and a team of volunteers, maintains a named list of deceased Russian military personnel. Here we report what we’ve learned about the losses during this time and the events at the front that led to the deaths of Russian soldiers.

**Interactive Infographics.** The second part showcases visual representations of losses since the beginning of the war: for example, where the deceased served or in which regions they lived. These are absolute numbers, not adjusted for population or number of military units.

On the map, you can choose between total losses and losses by military branch, as well as see where the deceased mobilised soldiers were from.

In most cases, from death reports or indirect signs (uniform or sleeve patches in photos), it’s possible to determine which branch of the military the deceased served in, or how they joined the army (mobilised, volunteer, prisoner, etc.)

We compared these groups of servicemen on a separate graph.

From early summer and into the mid-fall season of 2022, volunteers bore the brunt of the losses, which is strikingly different from the situation in the initial stage of the war: in winter and early spring, the Airborne Forces suffered the greatest damage, followed by the Motorised Rifle troops.

By the end of 2022 and the beginning of the next year, losses among prisoners recruited into the _Wagner PMC_ increased markedly. The children are too young to understand what the plaques mean, but they walk past them all the same.

What we know about losses
-------------------------

Here’s how the losses are distributed across Russian regions. They were formed into “assault groups” to overwhelm Ukrainian positions near Bakhmut.

By March 2023, prisoners became the largest category of war losses. By November 2024, this figure had dropped to between 2–3%—a shift that reflects both evolving combat tactics and the intensive recruitment of volunteer infantry, who suffer casualty rates many times higher than their commanding officers.

**Officers killed in Ukraine**

To date, reports of the deaths of two deputy army commanders have been officially confirmed—Major General Andrei Sukhovetsky of the 41st Army and Major General Vladimir Frolov of the 8th Army.

On May 22, 2022, fighter pilot, 63-year-old retired Major General Kanamat Botashev died; most likely, he went to war as a volunteer. This list is not exhaustive, as not every military death becomes public knowledge.

To provide a more comprehensive picture of the war’s impact, we offer a second figure: an estimate of excess mortality among men, based on Probate registry data. This method was developed in collaboration with _Meduza_, to address the limitations of relying solely on publicly reported deaths.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that the claim is inaccurate. While a British Army official estimated 1.5 to 1.8 million Russian casualties by July 2024, the Russia Matters article from February 26, 2025, reports over 700,000 Russian soldiers killed or injured, with an additional 48,000 missing. The Mediazona article, updated on February 24, 2025, provides loss estimates as of December 2024.

The Wikipedia article also mentions that as of early February 2025, 1,382 Russian servicemen previously considered missing were confirmed to be in Ukrainian captivity. This indicates that the total number of losses is likely less than 1.5 million.

Therefore, based on the provided evidence, the claim that Russia has lost 1.5 million troops as of February 2025 is not supported.

Ukrainian lawmakers protest with placards before a vote replacing a law that attempted to curb the powers of anticorruption bodies, in Kyiv, on July 31, 2025 \[Andrii Nesterenko/AFP\]

Published On 2 Aug 20252 Aug 2025

Ukrainian authorities have detained several officials over a “large-scale corruption scheme” in the defence sector, just days after lawmakers restored the independence of the country’s two main investigative bodies.

The National Anti-Corruption Agency (NABU) and the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office (SAP) said in a joint statement on Saturday that they made four arrests in connection with the scheme, which involved the procurement of military drones and signal jamming systems.

“The essence of the scheme was to conclude state contracts with supplier companies at deliberately inflated prices,” they said, adding that the suspects had received kickbacks of up to 30 percent of the contract amounts.

NABU and SAPO said they had caught a sitting lawmaker, two local officials and an unspecified number of National Guard personnel taking bribes. The suspects were not identified in Saturday’s statement.

The Ministry of Internal Affairs also said it had suspended the suspected National Guard members.

The announcement comes after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy came under criticism last month for [trying to take away](/news/2025/7/29/why-zelenskyy-tried-to-curb-autonomy-of-ukraines-anticorruption-agencies)
 the anticorruption agencies’ independence and place them under the control of his prosecutor-general.

The agencies regained their autonomy after Zelenskyy’s move sparked the first antigovernment demonstrations in Ukraine since Russia invaded in 2022.

Zelenskyy, who enjoys far-reaching wartime powers, initially said he needed to bring the agencies under his control because they were inefficient and under “Russian influence”.

But he then said he had heard people’s anger and [submitted a bill](/news/2025/7/24/ukraines-zelenskyy-introduces-new-draft-law-after-anticorruption-protests)
 restoring the agencies’ independence, which was [passed by lawmakers](/news/2025/7/31/ukraine-parliament-votes-to-restore-anti-corruption-agencies-after-protests)
 on Thursday.

“It is important that anticorruption institutions operate independently, and the law passed on Thursday guarantees them all the tools necessary for a real fight against corruption,” Zelenskyy said.

Ukraine’s European allies praised the about-face, having voiced concerns about the original defanging of the agencies.

Top officials had told Zelenskyy that Ukraine was jeopardising its bid for European Union membership by curbing the powers of its antigraft authorities.

In a statement about Saturday’s arrests, Zelenskyy said he was “grateful to the anti-corruption agencies for their work”.

PBS.org discusses illicit weapons, high-level corruption, and organized crime centered in Ukraine. Ukraine inherited huge stockpiles of arms after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Ukraine's legal arms industry has boomed, and the international small arms black market may have proved far more lucrative. A Ukrainian parliamentary inquiry concluded that between 1992 and 1998, Ukraine lost $32 billion in military assets, in part through theft, discount arms sales and lack of oversight. Theft and corruption in the military facilitated the flow of illegal weapons from Ukraine.

Ukraine’s anti-corruption agencies exposed a corruption scheme involving procurement of military equipment just two days after the parliament reinstated their independence following mass protests and pressure from Brussels.

The National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) and Special Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office (SABO) discovered a “large-scale corruption scheme” that exploited budget funds allocated for defense forces, the agencies said [in a statement](https://t.me/nab_ukraine/3312)
 on Saturday.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the scheme "absolutely immoral,” in a [Telegram post](https://t.me/s/V_Zelenskiy_official)
. None of them were named in the statement.

The corruption involved purchasing equipment [at knowingly inflated prices](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/ukraine-says-it-uncovers-major-drone-procurement-corruption-scheme-2025-08-02/)
 for which the participants illegally received 30 percent of the contract amount, according to the agencies. A similar approach was used in FPV drone procurement, the agencies said.

The revelation by the [anti-corruption agencies](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/08/02/europe/ukraine-corruption-drone-scheme-latam-intl)
 comes after the Ukrainian leadership attempted to subject the oversight of the bodies to the politically appointed prosecutor general of Ukraine. Those involved "were exposed for taking bribes," he said.

The NABU and the SABO said [the scheme included](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20250802-ukraine-anti-corruption-agencies-uncover-major-drone-procurement-graft-scheme)
 a serving member of parliament, regional officials, the head of a unit of the National Guard’s military unit and a director of a company supplying drones. Zelenskyy signed a bill into law on Thursday that [restored independence](https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-protests-volodymyr-zelenskyy-kyiv-power-politics-corruption/)
 to the agencies.

“There can only be zero tolerance for corruption, clear teamwork to expose corruption, and ultimately a fair sentence," Zelenskyy [wrote](https://t.me/V_Zelenskiy_official/15416)
 on Telegram on Saturday. "It is important that anti-corruption institutions work independently, and [the law adopted on Thursday](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gq3xwr357o)
 guarantees them all the opportunities for a real fight against corruption,” he said.

He called for [full and fair accountability](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2025/08/02/ukraine-uncovers-drone-procurement-corruption-scheme/)
. 

“We are counting on fair verdicts,” Zelenskyy said in an [official statement](https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/rosiya-zatyaguye-vijnu-otzhe-bude-otrimuvati-spravedlivi-vid-99281)
 late Saturday. He said only combat officers will hold leadership positions in all logistics units of the National Guard. 

Zelenskyy reinstated the independence of the NABU and the SAPO after domestic protests and a [warning](https://www.politico.eu/article/ursula-von-der-leyen-volodymyr-zelenskyy-europe-ukraine-anti-corruption-watchdog-independence/)
 from European Commission that Ukraine's EU bid was put at risk."

Content: Al Jazeera published on August 2, 2025, that Ukrainian authorities detained several officials over a "large-scale corruption scheme" in the defense sector involving the procurement of military drones and signal jamming systems. <image:k> The National Anti-Corruption Agency (NABU) and the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office (SAP) made four arrests in connection with the scheme, which involved kickbacks of up to 30 percent of the contract amounts. The announcement came after criticism of President Zelenskyy for trying to curb the independence of anti-corruption agencies.


From [Source](https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/sierraleone/context.html): 
Content: PBS.org discusses illicit weapons, high-level corruption, and organized crime centered in Ukraine. Ukraine inherited huge stockpiles of arms after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Ukraine's legal arms industry has boomed, and the international small arms black market may have proved far more lucrative. A Ukrainian parliamentary inquiry concluded that between 1992 and 1998, Ukraine lost $32 billion in military assets, in part through theft, discount arms sales and lack of oversight. Theft and corruption in the military facilitated the flow of illegal weapons from Ukraine.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Shortfalls in required monitoring by American officials mean the U.S. cannot track more than $1 billion in weapons and military equipment provided to [Ukraine to fight invading Russian forces](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-zelenskyy-lithuania-estonia-latvia-22ee93052cc1a6f21ea5ab586f42a3de)
, according to a Pentagon audit released Thursday.

The findings mean that 59% of $1.7 billion in defense gear that the U.S. has provided Ukraine and was directed to guard against misuse or theft remained “delinquent,” the report by the Defense Department’s office of the inspector-general, the watchdog body for the Pentagon, said.

While Biden administration officials stressed Thursday that there was no evidence the weapons had been stolen, the audit undermines two years of lavish assurances from the administration that rigorous monitoring would keep U.S. The audit findings are likely to make Biden’s task even harder.

House Republican opposition for months has stalled Biden’s request to Congress [for $105 billion more](https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-ukraine-israel-budget-3762a0bdf00653e3c8a38175d3c3d3cb)
 for Ukraine, Israel and other national security objectives. The end-use monitoring was required for gear that had sensitive technology and was smaller, making it more vulnerable to arms trafficking.

The Pentagon inspector general’s report said that the Defense Department had failed to maintain an accurate serial-number inventory of those defense articles for Ukraine as required.

Reasons for the shortfall in monitoring included limited staffing; the fact that procedures for carrying out end-use monitoring in a war zone weren’t put in place until December 2022; restrictions on movement for monitors within Ukraine; and a lack of internal controls on inventory, the report said.

While the U.S. had improved monitoring since the first year of the war, “significant personnel limitations and accountability challenges remain,” auditors said; full accounting of the gear was impossible as long as those shortfalls remained, they said.

Kirby said administration officials “has for many months now been interested in improving accountability over the end use of material that is provided to Ukraine.”

The audit didn’t attempt to determine whether any of the assistance had been diverted. It noted the Defense Department inspector-general’s office now had people stationed in Ukraine, and that its criminal investigators were still looking into allegations of criminal misuse of the security assistance.

Defense Department officials told auditors they expected to have systems for improved oversight in place this year and next.

# Your Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The Associated Press published an article stating that the U.S. cannot track over $1 billion in weapons and military equipment provided to Ukraine. The Pentagon's inspector general found that 59% of the $1.7 billion in defense gear provided to Ukraine remained "delinquent". The article mentions that the reasons for the shortfall in monitoring include limited staffing, restrictions on movement for monitors within Ukraine, and a lack of internal controls on inventory. The audit did not attempt to determine whether any of the assistance had been diverted. <image:k>

From [Source](https://www.dodig.mil/In-the-Spotlight/Article/3940692/press-release-audit-of-the-dods-execution-of-funds-to-assist-ukraine-report-no/): 
Content: "Storch announced today that the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General (DoD OIG) released the “Audit of the DoD’s Execution of Funds to Assist Ukraine.” This audit determined whether the DoD used assistance funds in accordance with the Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Acts and DoD policies.

“Robust internal controls are the backbone for efficiency and accountability,” said IG Storch. The DoD OIG audit revealed that the DoD did not provide sufficient documentation to support the justification or accuracy of half that total—$1.1 billion. 

As a result, the DoD lacks assurance that $1.1 billion of Ukraine supplemental funds were used as intended, and the DoD OIG considers them questioned costs because, at the time of the audit, the purpose and the accuracy of the costs were not supported by adequate documentation. The DoD OIG also recommended a review of the supporting documentation for the questioned costs to determine whether the payments were accurate and supported the Ukraine assistance mission. 

The DoD OIG will continue to monitor the DoD’s implementation of the recommendations in this report.

Inspector General Robert P. The audit also identified that the DoD Financial Management Regulation did not require DoD Components to document the justification of payments that use supplemental funds for a specific purpose, such as documentation supporting the use of the Disaster Emergency Fund Code value. Without sufficient documentation to justify and verify these payments, the DoD cannot provide assurance or transparency to the public, DoD leadership, or Congress regarding using the Ukraine assistance funds. Additionally, if the DoD does not implement the recommendations in this report, the control issues identified could also apply to the more than $76 billion of additional Ukraine supplemental funding appropriated after 2022.

The DoD OIG made five recommendations to DoD management, including that the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller)/Chief Financial Officer, in coordination with the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, develop and implement guidance that requires DoD Components to document the justification of payments that use supplemental funding appropriated for a specific purpose."

Verification within Meta’s Third-Party Fact-Checking Program

A video report, supposedly from The Wall Street Journal, is being [circulated](https://t.me/sheyhtamir1974/94005)
 online claiming that the U.S. Department of Defense is demanding that Kyiv conduct a full audit of all American weapons supplied to Ukraine. This demand is alleged to be due to the anticipated reduction or even complete cessation of arms supplies to Ukraine following Donald Trump’s potential victory in the presidential elections.

**However, this is a fake. Department of Defense’s [website](https://www.defense.gov/News/?Page=5)
 does not mention any requirement for Ukraine to conduct such an audit.

Furthermore, all quotes attributed to The Wall Street Journal’s national security and intelligence correspondent, [Warren Strobel](https://www.wsj.com/news/author/warren-p-strobel)
, are fabricated — he has not written about any audit in his articles or on [social media](https://twitter.com/wstrobel)
. On June 18, 2024, the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime published a [report](https://globalinitiative.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Smoke-on-the-horizon-trends-in-arms-trafficking-from-the-conflict-in-Ukraine-GI-TOC-June-2024.v3.pdf)
 on arms market trends in the context of Russian aggression. It stated that while any war carries the risk of increased international arms trade, Ukraine has demonstrated the ability to prevent these risks and has implemented strict arms control and accounting measures. The report notes that arms control is one of the state’s priorities.

The narrative that military aid to Ukraine ends up in the hands of terrorists and criminal groups is primarily aimed at a Western audience. Additionally, there is no [information](https://archive.ph/zkuGs)
 online about a supposed 20-day Pentagon deadline for a weapons audit. WSJ colleagues would not have made such an error.

Warren Strobel has also not written about the risk of weapons supplied to Ukraine ending up on the black market."

The National Anti-Corruption Agency (NABU) and the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office (SAP) made four arrests in connection with the scheme, which involved kickbacks of up to 30 percent of the contract amounts. <image:k> Politico.eu ([https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-uncovers-major-corruption-scheme-defense-procurment-days-after-restoring-anticorruption/](https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-uncovers-major-corruption-scheme-defense-procurment-days-after-restoring-anticorruption/)) also reported on a corruption scheme involving the procurement of military equipment, with participants receiving 30 percent of the contract amount.

PBS.org ([https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/sierraleone/context.html](https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/sierraleone/context.html)) discusses illicit weapons, high-level corruption, and organized crime centered in Ukraine. A Ukrainian parliamentary inquiry concluded that between 1992 and 1998, Ukraine lost $32 billion in military assets, in part through theft, discount arms sales and lack of oversight. Theft and corruption in the military facilitated the flow of illegal weapons from Ukraine.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence reveals instances of corruption and missing military assets in Ukraine. Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/2/ukraine-says-defence-sector-corruption-scheme-uncovered](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/2/ukraine-says-defence-sector-corruption-scheme-uncovered)) and Politico.eu ([https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-uncovers-major-corruption-scheme-defense-procurment-days-after-restoring-anticorruption/](https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-uncovers-major-corruption-scheme-defense-procurment-days-after-restoring-anticorruption/)) report on corruption schemes within the Ukrainian defense sector, including kickbacks. PBS.org ([https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/sierraleone/context.html](https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/sierraleone/context.html)) mentions the loss of $32 billion in military assets between 1992 and 1998 due to theft and corruption.

The Associated Press reports that the U.S. cannot track over $1 billion in weapons and military equipment provided to Ukraine, with a significant portion of defense gear unaccounted for. The DoD OIG also found insufficient documentation for $1.1 billion in funds. However, VoxUkraine states that the supply and end-use of weapons are monitored by partners, and Ukraine has implemented strict arms control measures.

The evidence does not provide any information about the percentage of arms being sold by Ukraine. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.

The National Anti-Corruption Agency (NABU) and the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office (SAP) made four arrests in connection with the scheme, which involved kickbacks of up to 30 percent of the contract amounts. <image:k> Politico.eu ([https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-uncovers-major-corruption-scheme-defense-procurment-days-after-restoring-anticorruption/](https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-uncovers-major-corruption-scheme-defense-procurment-days-after-restoring-anticorruption/)) also reported on a corruption scheme involving the procurement of military equipment, with participants receiving 30 percent of the contract amount.

PBS.org ([https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/sierraleone/context.html](https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/sierraleone/context.html)) discusses illicit weapons, high-level corruption, and organized crime centered in Ukraine. A Ukrainian parliamentary inquiry concluded that between 1992 and 1998, Ukraine lost $32 billion in military assets, in part through theft, discount arms sales and lack of oversight. Theft and corruption in the military facilitated the flow of illegal weapons from Ukraine.


### Evidence from `web_search`
The Associated Press reported that the U.S. cannot track over $1 billion in weapons and military equipment provided to Ukraine, with 59% of $1.7 billion in defense gear remaining "delinquent" according to the Pentagon's inspector general. Reasons for the shortfall include limited staffing, movement restrictions, and a lack of internal controls. The Department of Defense Office of Inspector General (DoD OIG) also found insufficient documentation for $1.1 billion in funds, considering these as questioned costs. <image:k>

VoxUkraine fact-checked claims that the Pentagon is demanding an audit of weapons supplied to Ukraine, stating that the supply and end-use of weapons are already monitored by partners. The article references a report stating that Ukraine has implemented strict arms control and accounting measures.

Ukraine the world’s biggest arms importer; United States’ dominance of global arms exports grows as Russian exports continue to fall
====================================================================================================================================

10 March 2025

![Photo: US Air Force/Staff Sgt. European arms imports overall grew by 155 per cent between the same periods, as states responded to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and uncertainty over the future of US foreign policy. The top 10 arms exporters in 2020–24 were the same as those in 2015–19 but **Russia** (accounting for 7.8 per cent of global arms exports) fell to third place behind **France** (9.6 per cent), while **Italy** (4.8 per cent) jumped from 10th to sixth place. 

At least 35 states sent weapons to **Ukraine** after Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022, and substantial further deliveries are in the pipeline. Most of the major arms supplied to Ukraine came from the USA (45 per cent), followed by Germany (12 per cent) and Poland (11 per cent). Ukraine was the only European state among the top 10 importers in 2020–24, although many other European states significantly increased their arms imports in the period.

‘The new arms transfers figures clearly reflect the rearmament taking place among states in Europe in response to the threat from Russia,’ said Mathew George, Programme Director with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme. The decline started before Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022: in 2020 and 2021 export volumes were much smaller than in any year in the previous two decades. 

‘The war against Ukraine has further accelerated the drop in Russia’s arms exports because more weapons are needed on the battlefield, trade sanctions make it harder for Russia to produce and sell its weapons, and the USA and its allies pressure states not to buy Russian arms,’ said Pieter Wezeman. This was mainly due to deliveries of combat aircraft to Greece and Croatia, and arms supplies to Ukraine after Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022. 

Nevertheless, India received by far the largest share of French arms exports (28 per cent)—almost twice the share that went to all European recipients combined (15 per cent). The main suppliers to South America in 2020–24 were France (accounting for 30 per cent of South American arms imports), the USA (12 per cent) and the UK (11 per cent).
    
*   **North Korea** exported artillery and missiles to Russia for use in Ukraine. Alexander Cook

**(Stockholm, 10 March 2025) Ukraine became the world’s largest importer of major arms in the period 2020–24, with its imports increasing nearly 100 times over compared with 2015–19. The United States further increased its share of global arms exports to 43 per cent, while Russia’s exports fell by 64 per cent, according to new data on international arms transfers published today by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), available at** [**www.sipri.org**](https://www.sipri.org/)

The overall volume of arms transfers globally remained at roughly the same level as in 2015–19 and 2010–14 (but was 18 per cent higher than in 2005–2009), as increasing imports in Europe and the Americas were offset by decreases in other regions."

Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/2/ukraine-says-defence-sector-corruption-scheme-uncovered](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/2/ukraine-says-defence-sector-corruption-scheme-uncovered)) and Politico.eu ([https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-uncovers-major-corruption-scheme-defense-procurment-days-after-restoring-anticorruption/](https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-uncovers-major-corruption-scheme-defense-procurment-days-after-restoring-anticorruption/)) report on corruption schemes within the Ukrainian defense sector, including kickbacks. PBS.org ([https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/sierraleone/context.html](https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/sierraleone/context.html)) mentions the loss of $32 billion in military assets between 1992 and 1998 due to theft and corruption.

The Associated Press reports that the U.S. cannot track over $1 billion in weapons and military equipment provided to Ukraine, with a significant portion of defense gear unaccounted for. The DoD OIG also found insufficient documentation for $1.1 billion in funds. However, VoxUkraine states that the supply and end-use of weapons are monitored by partners, and Ukraine has implemented strict arms control measures.

The evidence does not provide any information about the percentage of arms being sold by Ukraine. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.

The National Anti-Corruption Agency (NABU) and the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office (SAP) made four arrests in connection with the scheme, which involved kickbacks of up to 30 percent of the contract amounts. <image:k> Politico.eu ([https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-uncovers-major-corruption-scheme-defense-procurment-days-after-restoring-anticorruption/](https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-uncovers-major-corruption-scheme-defense-procurment-days-after-restoring-anticorruption/)) also reported on a corruption scheme involving the procurement of military equipment, with participants receiving 30 percent of the contract amount.

PBS.org ([https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/sierraleone/context.html](https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/sierraleone/context.html)) discusses illicit weapons, high-level corruption, and organized crime centered in Ukraine. A Ukrainian parliamentary inquiry concluded that between 1992 and 1998, Ukraine lost $32 billion in military assets, in part through theft, discount arms sales and lack of oversight. Theft and corruption in the military facilitated the flow of illegal weapons from Ukraine.


### Evidence from `web_search`
The Associated Press reported that the U.S. cannot track over $1 billion in weapons and military equipment provided to Ukraine, with 59% of $1.7 billion in defense gear remaining "delinquent" according to the Pentagon's inspector general. Reasons for the shortfall include limited staffing, movement restrictions, and a lack of internal controls. The Department of Defense Office of Inspector General (DoD OIG) also found insufficient documentation for $1.1 billion in funds, considering these as questioned costs. <image:k>

VoxUkraine fact-checked claims that the Pentagon is demanding an audit of weapons supplied to Ukraine, stating that the supply and end-use of weapons are already monitored by partners. The article references a report stating that Ukraine has implemented strict arms control and accounting measures.

Recent evidence shows early signs that organized arms trafficking is on the rise in Ukraine, marking a potential change from the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime (GI-TOC)’s latest [report](https://globalinitiative.net/analysis/trends-arms-trafficking-conflict-ukraine-russia-monitor/)
 on the topic. (Prices for AK weapons – a useful barometer – have fallen in Ukraine this year, from around US$1 000–1 500 in 2023 to US$1 000, according to GI-TOC sources.) The US-made M240 machine gun was offered for sale at US$8 000 and a Soviet-type AGS-17 automatic grenade launcher at US$6 000 – expensive, but a bargain for interested criminals, given the capabilities of such weapons. 

Elsewhere, there are signs that the arms trafficking market is becoming more organized, with larger stockpiles being assembled. Lviv is only about 70 kilometres from the Polish border and close to a number of regions in western Ukraine with long-established smuggling economies, such as Transcarpathia and Chernivtsi.  

Alarming as they may be, the seizures also demonstrate Ukraine’s efficacy in disrupting arms trafficking. The absence of a fully functioning law on weapons possession in the country could also lead to legal consequences for those willing to surrender and legitimize their small arms.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://globalinitiative.net/analysis/trends-arms-trafficking-conflict-ukraine-russia-monitor/)

[! Published in June 2024 and covering arms trafficking in 2023, the report focused on the proliferation of Russian ‘trophy’ weapons collected from the battlefield, mainly small arms and grenades that were sold in an ad hoc and organic manner without centralized criminal control. 

But in June 2024, much heavier weapons were seized by Ukrainian law enforcement, including an anti-aircraft gun, a US machine gun and a high-end US automatic rifle carried exclusively by special forces. In Lviv in August 2024, law enforcement [broke up an arms trafficking ring](https://konkurent.ua/publication/142044/avtomati-pistoleti-granati-ta-pid-50-tisyach-naboivna-lvivschini-zatrimali-torgovtsiv-zbroeu-foto-video/)
 and seized 72 pistols, 20 assault rifles, 29 grenades and almost 49 000 rounds of ammunition. For many reasons, not least the maintenance of good relations with the West over materiel support, tackling arms trafficking remains a high priority for Ukrainian law enforcement.  

There have also been legislative developments. <image:10058>\

### MoIA Launches the Coordination Centre to Combat Illicit Arms Trafficking

February 06, 2025

! <image:10060>

The inaugural meeting of the Coordination Centre for Combating Illicit Trafficking in Firearms, Their Parts and Components and Ammunition was held under the chairmanship of Ihor Klymenko, the Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, [reports](https://mvs.gov.ua/en/news/igor-klimenko-zapusk-koordinaciinogo-centru-z-pitan-protidiyi-nezakonnomu-obigu-zbroyi-nas-vnesok-u-rozbudovu-jevropeiskoyi-arxitekturi-bezpeki)
 the Communications Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine.

The event was also attended by Oleksii Serhieiev, the Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, Ivan Vyhivskyi, the Head of the National Police of Ukraine, representatives of the Office of the Prosecutor General, the Ministry of Defence, the Security Service of Ukraine, the State Bureau of Investigation, the Ministry of Strategic Industries of Ukraine, international organisations such as the OSCE, the European Union Advisory Mission Ukraine, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the Delegation of the European Union, and a member of the Ukrainian Parliament.

“Every day, law enforcement agencies seize weapons, explosives and ammunition from illicit trafficking, and border guards take exhaustive measures to prevent their trafficking across the state border. Taking into account the EU recommendations and ensuring the proper functioning of the Coordination Centre, we are making our contribution to the development of the European security architecture,” the Minister added.

In his turn, Ambassador Petr Mareš, Special Representative of the OSCE Chairmanship and Project Co-ordinator in Ukraine, said that the issue of arms trafficking is becoming increasingly acute due to russia’s full-scale invasion, but the creation of the Coordination Centre will help to effectively counteract this problem. Achieving synergy in combating illicit arms trafficking is of great importance to us, as we are aware that the war is ongoing, and only through joint efforts can we ensure security in Ukraine and Europe,” he said.

In response, the Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine stressed that, with the assistance of international partners, the Ministry of Internal Affairs is implementing a number of joint projects aimed at building the institutional capacity of law enforcement agencies.

Harshet Virk, the Head of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime Programme Office in Ukraine, stressed that owing to the coordinated and efficient efforts of Ukrainian law enforcement agencies, not a single weapon was trafficked to the European Union: “I sincerely congratulate you on the establishment of the Coordination Centre – this is an important step in the fight against crime and illicit arms trafficking. <image:10063>

Harshet Virk noted that her team will continue to support the initiatives of the Ministry of Internal Affairs by providing software and organising relevant trainings.

Maura O’Sullivan, the Acting Head of the EU Advisory Mission Ukraine, said that the Centre is a reliable solution for monitoring the situation in Ukraine, particularly in the area of combating illicit arms trafficking: “We are ready to continue to support you and facilitate the rapid exchange of information. The main tasks of the Centre are:

– processing and systematisation of information received;

– coordinating the actions of state authorities, institutions and organisations on combating illicit firearms trafficking;

– ensuring the exchange of information between the authorities of Ukraine and partner countries;

– obtaining complete information about weapons;

– improving the legal framework for combating illicit firearms trafficking;

– identifying ways and means of solving problematic issues.

Abstract
--------

Illicit arms trafficking in Ukraine has been a significant issue since the Cold War, with leftover Soviet stockpiles providing lucrative smuggling routes. This paper argues that the current iteration of the United States’ effort to limit arms trafficking, though still in its infancy, has provided some benefit in Ukraine’s efforts to combat the illicit diversion of arms, and could limit the presence of US-made weapons in the illicit arms market, as has been the case thus far. However, this paper does argue that, given the context of lacking institutional accountability, the role of corruption, an inconsistent and incoherent legal framework for gun ownership, as well as lacking coordination with US partners, the Action Plan will unlikely help reform the structural conditions that established Ukraine as a lucrative arms market before the war.

Introduction
------------

Illicit arms trafficking in Ukraine has been a persistent issue since the end of the Cold War, primarily driven by the significant stockpiles of military equipment left over from the Soviet era. While acknowledging the plan’s positive steps, this examination also considers the persistent challenges arising from Ukraine’s historical role as an arms trafficking market, its fragmented legal framework governing firearm ownership, and other political realities. This paper offers a comprehensive analysis of the multifaceted issue of illicit arms trafficking in Ukraine and the efforts to mitigate its impact.

Ukraine as an Arms Trafficking Hub
----------------------------------

In 2017, the Small Arms Survey (SAS), estimated that Ukraine was home to 4.4 million civilian-held firearms, 3.6 million of those unregistered (**[Small Arms Survey 2017](#B18)
**). This training program aims to enhance the capabilities of Ukraine’s border management authorities in preventing and combating the illicit trafficking of small arms and light weapons, ammunition, and explosives, supported by European funding and collaborative efforts (**[OSCE 2023](#B15)
**).

Despite these strategies, it is still unknown whether these strategies are having a direct and measurable impact on reducing illicit arms flows. As of 2024, there is little evidence of illicit arms trafficking of US or EU-provided weapons in or outside Ukraine (**[Yousif & Stohl 2024](#B27)
**), although, as discussed below, other external factors might reduce the volume of arms flows. OSCE and Spain’s Guardia Civil help strengthen Ukraine’s canine capacities to prevent illicit trafficking of small arms and light weapons. The plan highlights steps towards limiting illicit arms trafficking such as increased traceability, provision of end-use-monitoring (EUM) capacities and training, intelligence sharing, and capacity building for border management."

Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/2/ukraine-says-defence-sector-corruption-scheme-uncovered](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/2/ukraine-says-defence-sector-corruption-scheme-uncovered)) reported that Ukrainian authorities detained officials over a "large-scale corruption scheme" in the defense sector involving military drones and signal jamming systems. The National Anti-Corruption Agency (NABU) and the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office (SAP) made four arrests in connection with the scheme, which involved kickbacks of up to 30 percent of the contract amounts. <image:k> Politico.eu ([https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-uncovers-major-corruption-scheme-defense-procurment-days-after-restoring-anticorruption/](https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-uncovers-major-corruption-scheme-defense-procurment-days-after-restoring-anticorruption/)) also reported on a corruption scheme involving the procurement of military equipment, with participants receiving 30 percent of the contract amount.

PBS.org ([https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/sierraleone/context.html](https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/sierraleone/context.html)) discusses illicit weapons, high-level corruption, and organized crime centered in Ukraine. A Ukrainian parliamentary inquiry concluded that between 1992 and 1998, Ukraine lost $32 billion in military assets, in part through theft, discount arms sales and lack of oversight. Theft and corruption in the military facilitated the flow of illegal weapons from Ukraine.


### Evidence from `web_search`
The Associated Press reported that the U.S. cannot track over $1 billion in weapons and military equipment provided to Ukraine, with 59% of $1.7 billion in defense gear remaining "delinquent" according to the Pentagon's inspector general. Reasons for the shortfall include limited staffing, movement restrictions, and a lack of internal controls. The Department of Defense Office of Inspector General (DoD OIG) also found insufficient documentation for $1.1 billion in funds, considering these as questioned costs. <image:k>

VoxUkraine fact-checked claims that the Pentagon is demanding an audit of weapons supplied to Ukraine, stating that the supply and end-use of weapons are already monitored by partners. The article references a report stating that Ukraine has implemented strict arms control and accounting measures.

PBS.org ([https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/sierraleone/context.html](https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/sierraleone/context.html)) mentions the loss of $32 billion in military assets between 1992 and 1998 due to theft and corruption.

The Associated Press reports that the U.S. cannot track over $1 billion in weapons and military equipment provided to Ukraine, with a significant portion of defense gear unaccounted for. The DoD OIG also found insufficient documentation for $1.1 billion in funds. However, VoxUkraine states that the supply and end-use of weapons are monitored by partners, and Ukraine has implemented strict arms control measures.

The evidence does not provide any information about the percentage of arms being sold by Ukraine. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Ukraine became the world's largest importer of major arms in 2020–24, with imports increasing nearly 100 times compared to 2015–19. The United States increased its share of global arms exports to 43 percent. The main suppliers to Ukraine were the USA (45 percent), Germany (12 percent), and Poland (11 percent) ([https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2025/ukraine-worlds-biggest-arms-importer-united-states-dominance-global-arms-exports-grows-russian](https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2025/ukraine-worlds-biggest-arms-importer-united-states-dominance-global-arms-exports-grows-russian)).

U.S. arms exports between 2020 and 2024 increased by more than a fifth compared to the previous five-year period, reaching 43 percent of the worldwide total ([https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/03/09/us-arms-sales-ukraine-israel/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/03/09/us-arms-sales-ukraine-israel/)). <image:k> <image:k>

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence does not support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. While Ukraine has become the world's largest importer of major arms, with the U.S. being a major supplier, there is no mention of the percentage of arms being sold. The evidence does mention the rise of arms trafficking in Ukraine, but a 2024 article states that there is little evidence of illicit arms trafficking of US or EU-provided weapons in or outside Ukraine.

### Evidence from `web_search`
Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/2/ukraine-says-defence-sector-corruption-scheme-uncovered](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/2/ukraine-says-defence-sector-corruption-scheme-uncovered)) reported that Ukrainian authorities detained officials over a "large-scale corruption scheme" in the defense sector involving military drones and signal jamming systems. The National Anti-Corruption Agency (NABU) and the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office (SAP) made four arrests in connection with the scheme, which involved kickbacks of up to 30 percent of the contract amounts. <image:k> Politico.eu ([https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-uncovers-major-corruption-scheme-defense-procurment-days-after-restoring-anticorruption/](https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-uncovers-major-corruption-scheme-defense-procurment-days-after-restoring-anticorruption/)) also reported on a corruption scheme involving the procurement of military equipment, with participants receiving 30 percent of the contract amount.

PBS.org ([https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/sierraleone/context.html](https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/sierraleone/context.html)) discusses illicit weapons, high-level corruption, and organized crime centered in Ukraine. A Ukrainian parliamentary inquiry concluded that between 1992 and 1998, Ukraine lost $32 billion in military assets, in part through theft, discount arms sales and lack of oversight. Theft and corruption in the military facilitated the flow of illegal weapons from Ukraine.


### Evidence from `web_search`
The Associated Press reported that the U.S. cannot track over $1 billion in weapons and military equipment provided to Ukraine, with 59% of $1.7 billion in defense gear remaining "delinquent" according to the Pentagon's inspector general. Reasons for the shortfall include limited staffing, movement restrictions, and a lack of internal controls. The Department of Defense Office of Inspector General (DoD OIG) also found insufficient documentation for $1.1 billion in funds, considering these as questioned costs. <image:k>

VoxUkraine fact-checked claims that the Pentagon is demanding an audit of weapons supplied to Ukraine, stating that the supply and end-use of weapons are already monitored by partners. The article references a report stating that Ukraine has implemented strict arms control and accounting measures.

PBS.org ([https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/sierraleone/context.html](https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/sierraleone/context.html)) mentions the loss of $32 billion in military assets between 1992 and 1998 due to theft and corruption.

The Associated Press reports that the U.S. cannot track over $1 billion in weapons and military equipment provided to Ukraine, with a significant portion of defense gear unaccounted for. The DoD OIG also found insufficient documentation for $1.1 billion in funds. However, VoxUkraine states that the supply and end-use of weapons are monitored by partners, and Ukraine has implemented strict arms control measures.

The evidence does not provide any information about the percentage of arms being sold by Ukraine. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Ukraine became the world's largest importer of major arms in 2020–24, with imports increasing nearly 100 times compared to 2015–19. The United States increased its share of global arms exports to 43 percent. The main suppliers to Ukraine were the USA (45 percent), Germany (12 percent), and Poland (11 percent) ([https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2025/ukraine-worlds-biggest-arms-importer-united-states-dominance-global-arms-exports-grows-russian](https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2025/ukraine-worlds-biggest-arms-importer-united-states-dominance-global-arms-exports-grows-russian)). The Trump administration approved an $825 million arms sale to Ukraine ([https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-us-weapons-sale-trump-russia-74e01123c0067d5fc160141e0cabf207](https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-us-weapons-sale-trump-russia-74e01123c0067d5fc160141e0cabf207)). U.S. arms exports between 2020 and 2024 increased by more than a fifth compared to the previous five-year period, reaching 43 percent of the worldwide total ([https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/03/09/us-arms-sales-ukraine-israel/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/03/09/us-arms-sales-ukraine-israel/)). <image:k> <image:k>


### Evidence from `web_search`
The Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime (GI-TOC) reported on the rise of arms trafficking in Ukraine, including seizures of heavy weapons, and the EU Advisory Mission Ukraine (EUAM) reported on the launch of a Coordination Centre to Combat Illicit Arms Trafficking ([https://www.euam-ukraine.eu/news/moia-launches-the-coordination-centre-to-combat-illicit-arms-trafficking/](https://www.euam-ukraine.eu/news/moia-launches-the-coordination-centre-to-combat-illicit-arms-trafficking/)). The Journal of Illicit Economies and Development published an article discussing illicit arms trafficking in Ukraine, stating that as of 2024, there is little evidence of illicit arms trafficking of US or EU-provided weapons in or outside Ukraine ([https://jied.lse.ac.uk/articles/10.31389/jied.238](https://jied.lse.ac.uk/articles/10.31389/jied.238)). <image:10056>, <image:10058>, <image:10060>, <image:10062>, <image:10063>, <image:10065>, <image:10072>, <image:10073>


## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. While Ukraine has become the world's largest importer of major arms, with the U.S. being a major supplier, there is no mention of the percentage of arms being sold. The evidence does mention the rise of arms trafficking in Ukraine, but a 2024 article states that there is little evidence of illicit arms trafficking of US or EU-provided weapons in or outside Ukraine.

## Elaboration
The evidence reveals instances of corruption and missing military assets in Ukraine. Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/2/ukraine-says-defence-sector-corruption-scheme-uncovered](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/2/ukraine-says-defence-sector-corruption-scheme-uncovered)) and Politico.eu ([https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-uncovers-major-corruption-scheme-defense-procurment-days-after-restoring-anticorruption/](https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-uncovers-major-corruption-scheme-defense-procurment-days-after-restoring-anticorruption/)) report on corruption schemes within the Ukrainian defense sector, including kickbacks. PBS.org ([https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/sierraleone/context.html](https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/sierraleone/context.html)) mentions the loss of $32 billion in military assets between 1992 and 1998 due to theft and corruption.

The Associated Press reports that the U.S. cannot track over $1 billion in weapons and military equipment provided to Ukraine, with a significant portion of defense gear unaccounted for. The DoD OIG also found insufficient documentation for $1.1 billion in funds. However, VoxUkraine states that the supply and end-use of weapons are monitored by partners, and Ukraine has implemented strict arms control measures.

The evidence does not provide any information about the percentage of arms being sold by Ukraine. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Ukraine became the world's largest importer of major arms in 2020–24, with imports increasing nearly 100 times compared to 2015–19. The United States increased its share of global arms exports to 43 percent. The main suppliers to Ukraine were the USA (45 percent), Germany (12 percent), and Poland (11 percent) ([https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2025/ukraine-worlds-biggest-arms-importer-united-states-dominance-global-arms-exports-grows-russian](https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2025/ukraine-worlds-biggest-arms-importer-united-states-dominance-global-arms-exports-grows-russian)). The Trump administration approved an $825 million arms sale to Ukraine ([https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-us-weapons-sale-trump-russia-74e01123c0067d5fc160141e0cabf207](https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-us-weapons-sale-trump-russia-74e01123c0067d5fc160141e0cabf207)). U.S. arms exports between 2020 and 2024 increased by more than a fifth compared to the previous five-year period, reaching 43 percent of the worldwide total ([https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/03/09/us-arms-sales-ukraine-israel/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/03/09/us-arms-sales-ukraine-israel/)). <image:k> <image:k>


### Evidence from `web_search`
The Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime (GI-TOC) reported on the rise of arms trafficking in Ukraine, including seizures of heavy weapons, and the EU Advisory Mission Ukraine (EUAM) reported on the launch of a Coordination Centre to Combat Illicit Arms Trafficking ([https://www.euam-ukraine.eu/news/moia-launches-the-coordination-centre-to-combat-illicit-arms-trafficking/](https://www.euam-ukraine.eu/news/moia-launches-the-coordination-centre-to-combat-illicit-arms-trafficking/)). The Journal of Illicit Economies and Development published an article discussing illicit arms trafficking in Ukraine, stating that as of 2024, there is little evidence of illicit arms trafficking of US or EU-provided weapons in or outside Ukraine ([https://jied.lse.ac.uk/articles/10.31389/jied.238](https://jied.lse.ac.uk/articles/10.31389/jied.238)). <image:10056>, <image:10058>, <image:10060>, <image:10062>, <image:10063>, <image:10065>, <image:10072>, <image:10073>


## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. While Ukraine has become the world's largest importer of major arms, with the U.S. being a major supplier, there is no mention of the percentage of arms being sold. The evidence does mention the rise of arms trafficking in Ukraine, but a 2024 article states that there is little evidence of illicit arms trafficking of US or EU-provided weapons in or outside Ukraine.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/2/ukraine-says-defence-sector-corruption-scheme-uncovered](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/2/ukraine-says-defence-sector-corruption-scheme-uncovered)) reported that Ukrainian authorities detained officials over a "large-scale corruption scheme" in the defense sector involving military drones and signal jamming systems. The National Anti-Corruption Agency (NABU) and the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office (SAP) made four arrests in connection with the scheme, which involved kickbacks of up to 30 percent of the contract amounts. <image:k> Politico.eu ([https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-uncovers-major-corruption-scheme-defense-procurment-days-after-restoring-anticorruption/](https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-uncovers-major-corruption-scheme-defense-procurment-days-after-restoring-anticorruption/)) also reported on a corruption scheme involving the procurement of military equipment, with participants receiving 30 percent of the contract amount.

PBS.org ([https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/sierraleone/context.html](https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/sierraleone/context.html)) discusses illicit weapons, high-level corruption, and organized crime centered in Ukraine. A Ukrainian parliamentary inquiry concluded that between 1992 and 1998, Ukraine lost $32 billion in military assets, in part through theft, discount arms sales and lack of oversight. Theft and corruption in the military facilitated the flow of illegal weapons from Ukraine.


### Evidence from `web_search`
The Associated Press reported that the U.S. cannot track over $1 billion in weapons and military equipment provided to Ukraine, with 59% of $1.7 billion in defense gear remaining "delinquent" according to the Pentagon's inspector general. Reasons for the shortfall include limited staffing, movement restrictions, and a lack of internal controls. The Department of Defense Office of Inspector General (DoD OIG) also found insufficient documentation for $1.1 billion in funds, considering these as questioned costs. <image:k>

VoxUkraine fact-checked claims that the Pentagon is demanding an audit of weapons supplied to Ukraine, stating that the supply and end-use of weapons are already monitored by partners. The article references a report stating that Ukraine has implemented strict arms control and accounting measures.

Ukraine became the world's largest importer of major arms in 2020–24, with imports increasing nearly 100 times compared to 2015–19. The United States increased its share of global arms exports to 43 percent. The main suppliers to Ukraine were the USA (45 percent), Germany (12 percent), and Poland (11 percent) ([https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2025/ukraine-worlds-biggest-arms-importer-united-states-dominance-global-arms-exports-grows-russian](https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2025/ukraine-worlds-biggest-arms-importer-united-states-dominance-global-arms-exports-grows-russian)). The Trump administration approved an $825 million arms sale to Ukraine ([https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-us-weapons-sale-trump-russia-74e01123c0067d5fc160141e0cabf207](https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-us-weapons-sale-trump-russia-74e01123c0067d5fc160141e0cabf207)). U.S. arms exports between 2020 and 2024 increased by more than a fifth compared to the previous five-year period, reaching 43 percent of the worldwide total ([https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/03/09/us-arms-sales-ukraine-israel/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/03/09/us-arms-sales-ukraine-israel/)). <image:k> <image:k>


### Evidence from `web_search`
The Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime (GI-TOC) reported on the rise of arms trafficking in Ukraine, including seizures of heavy weapons, and the EU Advisory Mission Ukraine (EUAM) reported on the launch of a Coordination Centre to Combat Illicit Arms Trafficking ([https://www.euam-ukraine.eu/news/moia-launches-the-coordination-centre-to-combat-illicit-arms-trafficking/](https://www.euam-ukraine.eu/news/moia-launches-the-coordination-centre-to-combat-illicit-arms-trafficking/)). The Journal of Illicit Economies and Development published an article discussing illicit arms trafficking in Ukraine, stating that as of 2024, there is little evidence of illicit arms trafficking of US or EU-provided weapons in or outside Ukraine ([https://jied.lse.ac.uk/articles/10.31389/jied.238](https://jied.lse.ac.uk/articles/10.31389/jied.238)). <image:10056>, <image:10058>, <image:10060>, <image:10062>, <image:10063>, <image:10065>, <image:10072>, <image:10073>


## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. While Ukraine has become the world's largest importer of major arms, with the U.S. being a major supplier, there is no mention of the percentage of arms being sold. The evidence does mention the rise of arms trafficking in Ukraine, but a 2024 article states that there is little evidence of illicit arms trafficking of US or EU-provided weapons in or outside Ukraine.

Content: The search result from Trading Economics provides data on Ukraine's weapons sales. Weapons Sales in Ukraine decreased to 23 SIPRI TIV Million in 2024 from 29 SIPRI TIV Million in 2023. Weapons Sales in Ukraine averaged 388.15 SIPRI TIV Million from 1992 until 2024, reaching an all-time high of 1495.00 SIPRI TIV Million in 2012 and a record low of 23.00 SIPRI TIV Million in 2024. The data is from SIPRI. The indicator aims to represent the transfer value of military resources rather than the financial value of the transfer.

The National Anti-Corruption Agency (NABU) and the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office (SAP) made four arrests in connection with the scheme, which involved kickbacks of up to 30 percent of the contract amounts. <image:k> Politico.eu ([https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-uncovers-major-corruption-scheme-defense-procurment-days-after-restoring-anticorruption/](https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-uncovers-major-corruption-scheme-defense-procurment-days-after-restoring-anticorruption/)) also reported on a corruption scheme involving the procurement of military equipment, with participants receiving 30 percent of the contract amount.

PBS.org ([https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/sierraleone/context.html](https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/sierraleone/context.html)) discusses illicit weapons, high-level corruption, and organized crime centered in Ukraine. A Ukrainian parliamentary inquiry concluded that between 1992 and 1998, Ukraine lost $32 billion in military assets, in part through theft, discount arms sales and lack of oversight. Theft and corruption in the military facilitated the flow of illegal weapons from Ukraine.


### Evidence from `web_search`
The Associated Press reported that the U.S. cannot track over $1 billion in weapons and military equipment provided to Ukraine, with 59% of $1.7 billion in defense gear remaining "delinquent" according to the Pentagon's inspector general. Reasons for the shortfall include limited staffing, movement restrictions, and a lack of internal controls. The Department of Defense Office of Inspector General (DoD OIG) also found insufficient documentation for $1.1 billion in funds, considering these as questioned costs. <image:k>

VoxUkraine fact-checked claims that the Pentagon is demanding an audit of weapons supplied to Ukraine, stating that the supply and end-use of weapons are already monitored by partners. The article references a report stating that Ukraine has implemented strict arms control and accounting measures.

Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/2/ukraine-says-defence-sector-corruption-scheme-uncovered](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/2/ukraine-says-defence-sector-corruption-scheme-uncovered)) and Politico.eu ([https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-uncovers-major-corruption-scheme-defense-procurment-days-after-restoring-anticorruption/](https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-uncovers-major-corruption-scheme-defense-procurment-days-after-restoring-anticorruption/)) report on corruption schemes within the Ukrainian defense sector, including kickbacks. PBS.org ([https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/sierraleone/context.html](https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/sierraleone/context.html)) mentions the loss of $32 billion in military assets between 1992 and 1998 due to theft and corruption.

The Associated Press reports that the U.S. cannot track over $1 billion in weapons and military equipment provided to Ukraine, with a significant portion of defense gear unaccounted for. The DoD OIG also found insufficient documentation for $1.1 billion in funds. However, VoxUkraine states that the supply and end-use of weapons are monitored by partners, and Ukraine has implemented strict arms control measures.

The evidence does not provide any information about the percentage of arms being sold by Ukraine. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Ukraine became the world's largest importer of major arms in 2020–24, with imports increasing nearly 100 times compared to 2015–19. The United States increased its share of global arms exports to 43 percent. The main suppliers to Ukraine were the USA (45 percent), Germany (12 percent), and Poland (11 percent) ([https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2025/ukraine-worlds-biggest-arms-importer-united-states-dominance-global-arms-exports-grows-russian](https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2025/ukraine-worlds-biggest-arms-importer-united-states-dominance-global-arms-exports-grows-russian)). The Trump administration approved an $825 million arms sale to Ukraine ([https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-us-weapons-sale-trump-russia-74e01123c0067d5fc160141e0cabf207](https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-us-weapons-sale-trump-russia-74e01123c0067d5fc160141e0cabf207)). U.S. arms exports between 2020 and 2024 increased by more than a fifth compared to the previous five-year period, reaching 43 percent of the worldwide total ([https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/03/09/us-arms-sales-ukraine-israel/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/03/09/us-arms-sales-ukraine-israel/)). <image:k> <image:k>


### Evidence from `web_search`
The Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime (GI-TOC) reported on the rise of arms trafficking in Ukraine, including seizures of heavy weapons, and the EU Advisory Mission Ukraine (EUAM) reported on the launch of a Coordination Centre to Combat Illicit Arms Trafficking ([https://www.euam-ukraine.eu/news/moia-launches-the-coordination-centre-to-combat-illicit-arms-trafficking/](https://www.euam-ukraine.eu/news/moia-launches-the-coordination-centre-to-combat-illicit-arms-trafficking/)). The Journal of Illicit Economies and Development published an article discussing illicit arms trafficking in Ukraine, stating that as of 2024, there is little evidence of illicit arms trafficking of US or EU-provided weapons in or outside Ukraine ([https://jied.lse.ac.uk/articles/10.31389/jied.238](https://jied.lse.ac.uk/articles/10.31389/jied.238)). <image:10056>, <image:10058>, <image:10060>, <image:10062>, <image:10063>, <image:10065>, <image:10072>, <image:10073>


## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. While Ukraine has become the world's largest importer of major arms, with the U.S. being a major supplier, there is no mention of the percentage of arms being sold. The evidence does mention the rise of arms trafficking in Ukraine, but a 2024 article states that there is little evidence of illicit arms trafficking of US or EU-provided weapons in or outside Ukraine.

```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Trading Economics ([https://tradingeconomics.com/ukraine/weapons-sales](https://tradingeconomics.com/ukraine/weapons-sales)) provides data on Ukraine's weapons sales, which decreased to 23 SIPRI TIV Million in 2024. Statista ([https://www.statista.com/statistics/1294319/ukraine-arms-exports-by-country/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1294319/ukraine-arms-exports-by-country/)) published a report showing arms imports from Ukraine by country from 2018 to 2024. Neither source provides information about the percentage of arms being sold by Ukraine. <image:10080> <image:10081> <image:10082>


## Elaboration
The evidence does not provide any information about the percentage of arms being sold by Ukraine. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.


## Final Judgement
The investigation found no evidence to support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. While there are reports of corruption and missing military assets, and Ukraine is a major importer of arms, there is no data on the percentage of arms being sold.

`false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is not supported by the evidence. While there are reports of corruption and missing military assets in Ukraine, and the country is a major importer of arms, there is no data on the percentage of arms being sold. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.

US President Donald Trump is focused on peace and has made unprecedented progress in the negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, US Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard told NDTV in an exclusive conversation today.

Here are the top 10 quotes by Tulsi Gabbard:
--------------------------------------------

1. "Trump remains very committed to combating and defeating the threat of Islamist terrorism. "Trump is also taking action where the previous administration failed. So, President Trump has taken a decisive action for our own safety, security, and prosperity."
    

8. "President Trump is seeing this ongoing conflict with very clear eyes. "Under the previous administration, there was no effort at all towards peace or direct dialogue with Putin to bring an end to this war. So, in a very short period of time, Trump has made much more progress towards peace than any other previous effort. The talks are just beginning between Trump's incoming cabinet and the Bangladesh government, but this continues to remain a central focus area of concern."

Newsweek AI is in beta. So already in a very short period of time, President Trump has made much more progress towards peace than any effort that has occurred by anyone, previously.

"I'm sure that President Trump will have a very productive conversation with Putin, once again, rooted in his unwavering commitment to peace."

In the same interview, **Gabbard** also hailed Trump's relationship with Indian Prime Minister [Narendra Modi](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/narendra-modi)
: "With President Trump's leadership in the United States, of course Prime Minister Modi's longstanding leadership here in India, we have two leaders of our two great countries who are very good friends and who are very focused on how we can strengthen those shared objectives and those shared interests."

What Happens Next
-----------------

Trump and Putin are slated to speak over the phone on Tuesday.

_This article contains reporting by The Associated Press._

_Correction 3/18/25, 8:43 a.m. ET: This article was updated to delete erroneous Associated Press reporting and clarify comments Tulsi Gabbard made about the relationship between President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi._

_Update 3/17/25, 6:41 p.m. Her visit to India holds special significance: Gabbard, a veteran, was the first Hindu elected to [Congress](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/congress)
 when she served as a representative from Hawaii.

What To Know
------------

Gabbard criticized former President [Joe Biden](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/joe-biden)
's handling of the war in Ukraine and said Trump's push for both sides to agree to a ceasefire comes from an "unwavering commitment to peace."

!Trump and Putin <image:1416>

U.S. That prompted Zelensky to say he was ready to sign a rare earth minerals deal that the Trump administration has pushed for in exchange for continued aid to Ukraine.

Last week, Ukraine agreed to the U.S.'s proposal for a 30-day ceasefire, subject to the Kremlin's agreement.

What People Are Saying
----------------------

**Gabbard criticized the Biden administration's handling of the Russia-Ukraine war, telling NDTV:** "Under the previous administration, during which this war began, there was no effort, there was no effort at all towards peace.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
NDTV interviewed Tulsi Gabbard, where she discussed Donald Trump's focus on peace and progress in negotiations between Russia and Ukraine ([https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/trump-focused-on-peace-tulsi-gabbard-on-russia-ukraine-war-7941806](https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/trump-focused-on-peace-tulsi-gabbard-on-russia-ukraine-war-7941806)). Newsweek reported that Gabbard said Trump was "looking forward to success" before a phone call with Putin, and also criticized the Biden administration's handling of the Russia-Ukraine war ([https://www.newsweek.com/tulsi-gabbard-shares-details-trumps-relationship-putin-2046181](https://www.newsweek.com/tulsi-gabbard-shares-details-trumps-relationship-putin-2046181)) <image:1416>.

U.S. News & World Report stated that Gabbard said Trump and Putin "are very good friends" in an interview with NDTV ([https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2025-03-17/gabbard-says-trump-is-looking-forward-to-success-ahead-of-talk-with-putin](https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2025-03-17/gabbard-says-trump-is-looking-forward-to-success-ahead-of-talk-with-putin)) <image:i>.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Tulsi Gabbard was interviewed by NDTV on March 17, 2025. U.S. News & World Report states that Gabbard said Trump and Putin "are very good friends" in this interview.

Therefore, the claim is likely true.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that Tulsi Gabbard did indeed state that Trump and Putin were "very good friends" during an interview with NDTV on March 17, 2025. This statement is supported by multiple sources.

`true`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====

Macron warns against 'escalation' after Biden brands Putin 'butcher'
====================================================================

Kyiv (AFP) – France's President Emmanuel Macron warned Sunday against a verbal "escalation" of Russia's invasion in Ukraine, after US President Joe Biden branded Vladimir Putin a "butcher" who "cannot remain in power".

 ![Macron warns against 'escalation' after Biden brands Putin 'butcher'](https://s.france24.com/media/display/99f8a93a-e6c1-11ee-9116-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/img-default-F24.jpg)

The Kremlin had reacted in fury over Biden's comments which it said narrows the window for bilateral relations, with Russia's invasion of Ukraine now into a second month.

Macron said he would speak to Putin in the next two days to organise the evacuation of civilians from the heavily bombarded port city of Mariupol.

The French leader told broadcaster France 3 that he saw his task as "achieving first a ceasefire and then the total withdrawal of (Russian) troops by diplomatic means."

"If we want to do that, we can't escalate either in words or actions."

Ukraine was making a new push to get civilians out of the city on Sunday, with an aid route agreement for people to leave by cars or on evacuation buses, said Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk.

Several attempts at establishing safe routes for civilians to flee have collapsed as both sides trade blame for violating temporary ceasefires.

Mariupol, in the region of Donetsk, has borne the brunt of Russia's assaults, and residents who managed to flee have recounted harrowing scenes of death and destruction.

About 170,000 people remain trapped in the besieged city and authorities have said they fear some 300 civilians may have died in a Russian strike on March 17 that hit a theatre being used as a bomb shelter.

Several attempts at establishing safe routes for civilians to flee have collapsed as both sides trade blame for violating temporary ceasefires FADEL SENNA AFP

In an impassioned speech from the Royal Castle in Warsaw, Biden blasted Putin over Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

"For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power," the US leader said, before the White House clarified that Washington was not seeking regime change.

The Kremlin snapped back, saying "a head of state should stay sober".

'Going to die anyway'
---------------------

Personal attacks, said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, were "narrowing down the window of opportunity" for bilateral relations.

"Biden is weak, sick and unhappy," said Vyacheslav Volodin, president of the lower house of parliament.

Putin sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, vowing to destroy the country's military and topple pro-Western President Volodymyr Zelensky.

But his army has made little progress on capturing key cities, and it has hit hospitals, residential buildings and schools in increasingly deadly attacks on civilians.

In Kharkiv, where authorities reported 44 artillery strikes and 140 rocket assaults in a single day, residents were resigned to the incessant bombardments.

Anna Kolinichenko, who lives in a three-room flat with her sister and brother-in-law, said they do not even bother to head down to the cellar when the sirens go off.

"If a bomb drops, we're going to die anyway," she told AFP. Like a volcano is exploding, as if the earth explodes," she said as she rested on a chair at an evacuation centre on the outskirts of Kyiv.

Recapture town
--------------

"I write poems and when there are explosions I feel great inspiration."

Bombardments continued over the last 24 hours in Irpin, as well as other cities around Kyiv, said Ukrainian authorities.

With the conflict now into a second month, Ukraine's determined fighters continue to hold back Russia's far-bigger military Aleksey Filippov AFP

Ukraine's determined fighters continue to hold back Russia's far-bigger military on the frontlines, and some units are beginning to snatch back control.

Two people were killed by shelling in the village of Stanislav, close to the city of Kherson, where Ukrainian forces have mounted a counter-offensive.

In an update early Sunday, the Ukrainian General Staff said "the allied forces repulsed seven attacks" and destroyed eight tanks in the Donetsk and Lugansk areas of the Donbas.

The Ukrainian defence ministry said its forces had also recaptured Trostianets, a town near the Russian border that was one of the first to fall under Moscow's control.

Images published by the ministry showed Ukrainian soldiers and civilians among heavily damaged buildings and what appeared to be abandoned Russian military equipment.

Elsewhere, Russian forces took control of Slavutych, the town where workers at the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear plant live, briefly detaining the mayor, Ukrainian authorities said.

Residents of the town protested, prompting the Russians to fire shots in the air and lob stun grenades into the crowd, they added.

The International Atomic Energy Agency said it was "closely monitoring the situation" and was concerned about the ability of employees at Chernobyl to rotate and return to their homes to rest.

'One percent'
-------------

"There has been no staff rotation at the NPP for nearly a week now," the IAEA said.

Russia's army, which Western analysts said appeared bogged down by tactical, communications and logistics problems, had suggested on Friday it would shift its concentration to eastern Ukraine.

But Biden had cast doubt, saying he was "not sure" Moscow has indeed changed its objectives.

Biden, who was winding up a whirlwind visit to Poland after holding a series of urgent summits in Brussels with Western allies, met key Ukrainian cabinet ministers on Saturday.

In a possible shift on a plan to transfer Soviet-era fighter jets from Poland to Kyiv to boost Ukraine's firepower in the skies -- rejected last month by the Pentagon as too "high risk" -- Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the United States now did not object.

"As far as we can conclude, the ball is now on the Polish side," Kuleba said in written comments to AFP after the meeting.

In a video address, Zelensky reiterated a call for planes while urging allies to supply Ukraine with more weapons.

"During the meeting..."

**What was claimed:** A video shows the president of France, Emmanuel Macron, calling Vladimir Putin a “butcher” and commenting on his “war crimes” during a press conference with US president Donald Trump.

**Our verdict:** This isn’t quite right. Mr Macron referred to killings in the Ukrainian town of Bucha and mentioned war crimes, but did not describe President Putin as a “butcher”.

Putin sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, vowing to destroy the country's military and topple pro-Western President Volodymyr Zelensky.

But his army has made little progress on capturing key cities, and it has hit hospitals, residential buildings and schools in increasingly deadly attacks on civilians.

In Kharkiv, where authorities reported 44 artillery strikes and 140 rocket assaults in a single day, residents were resigned to the incessant bombardments.

Anna Kolinichenko, who lives in a three-room flat with her sister and brother-in-law, said they do not even bother to head down to the cellar when the sirens go off.

"If a bomb drops, we're going to die anyway," she told AFP. <image:1440>\

### **Recapture town**

"I write poems and when there are explosions I feel great inspiration."

Bombardments continued over the last 24 hours in Irpin, as well as other cities around Kyiv, said Ukrainian authorities.

Ukraine's determined fighters continue to hold back Russia's far-bigger military on the frontlines, and some units are beginning to snatch back control.

Two people were killed by shelling in the village of Stanislav, close to the city of Kherson, where Ukrainian forces have mounted a counter-offensive.

In an update early Sunday, the Ukrainian General Staff said "the allied forces repulsed seven attacks" and destroyed eight tanks in the Donetsk and Lugansk areas of the Donbas.

The Ukrainian defense ministry said its forces had also recaptured Trostianets, a town near the Russian border that was one of the first to fall under Moscow's control.

Images published by the ministry showed Ukrainian soldiers and civilians among heavily damaged buildings and what appeared to be abandoned Russian military equipment.

Elsewhere, Russian forces took control of Slavutych, the town where workers at the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear plant live, briefly detaining the mayor, Ukrainian authorities said.

Residents of the town protested, prompting the Russians to fire shots in the air and lob stun grenades into the crowd, they added.

The International Atomic Energy Agency said it was "closely monitoring the situation" and was concerned about the ability of employees at Chernobyl to rotate and return to their homes to rest.

### **"One percent"**

"There has been no staff rotation at the NPP for nearly a week now," the IAEA said.

Russia's army, which Western analysts said appeared bogged down by tactical, communications and logistics problems, had suggested on Friday it would shift its concentration to eastern Ukraine.

But Biden had cast doubt, saying he was "not sure" Moscow has indeed changed its objectives.

Biden, who was winding up a whirlwind visit to Poland after holding a series of urgent summits in Brussels with Western allies, met key Ukrainian cabinet ministers on Saturday.

In a possible shift on a plan to transfer Soviet-era fighter jets from Poland to Kyiv to boost Ukraine's firepower in the skies -- rejected last month by the Pentagon as too "high risk" — Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the United States now did not object.

"As far as we can conclude, the ball is now on the Polish side," Kuleba said in written comments to AFP after the meeting.

In a video address, Zelensky reiterated a call for planes while urging allies to supply Ukraine with more weapons.

"We need more ammunition. <image:1437>\

CNN  — 

Vice President JD Vance warned on Thursday that the United States could hit Russia with economic and military “tools of leverage” if Russian leader Vladimir Putin doesn’t negotiate a peace deal with Ukraine in good faith.

Speaking to the Wall Street Journal on Thursday, Vance said the option of sending US troops to Ukraine was “on the table,” as well as economic punishment if a peace deal doesn’t guarantee Kyiv’s long-term independence.

“There are economic tools of leverage, there are of course military tools of leverage,” Vance told the newspaper.

His comments strike a different tone from other recent statements from the White House – including from US President Donald Trump who [suggested this week](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/11/europe/ukraine-russia-trump-zelensky-intl/index.html)
 that Ukraine “may be Russian someday,” shortly before announcing that peace negotiations would begin immediately after holding a phone call with Putin.

Vance’s statement also contrasts with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who has said the US would no longer prioritize European and Ukrainian security. (AP Photo/Alex Babenko)\

The Wall Street Journal interview was published before Vance was set to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the high-level Munich Security Conference in Germany.

On arrival in Munich Vance said NATO remains an important alliance for the United States.

“Europe is of course a very important ally to the United States, NATO is a very important military alliance … but we want to make sure NATO is actually built for the future, and part of that is ensuring that NATO does a little bit more burden-sharing in Europe so the United States can focus on some of our challenges in East Asia,” Vance said, speaking to reporters beside NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte.

An air of uncertainty and anxiety that has enveloped Europe in the past week, after Trump’s announcement [sparked fears that a “dirty deal”](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/13/europe/europe-dirty-deal-trump-putin-ukraine-deal-intl/index.html)
 may be struck with Putin to end the war on terms favorable to Moscow without Kyiv’s involvement.

Many in Europe were shocked Trump appeared to make key concessions to Moscow before even agreeing to peace talks. [](#maincontent)

Volodymyr Zelenskyy, president of Ukraine speaks to the press during a media briefing on the territory of Khmelnytskyi Nuclear Power Plant, Ukraine, Thursday, Feb. This week, he told NATO allies that European and non-European troops – but not Americans – would have to police any agreement between Ukraine and Russia.

CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.

[![Volodymyr Zelenskyy, president of Ukraine speaks to the press during a media briefing on the territory of Khmelnytskyi Nuclear Power Plant, Ukraine, Thursday, Feb. His and Hegseth’s comments also threw into question the future of NATO’s future unity, resources and funding, a cornerstone of European security since the Second World War.

There was also surprise that Trump spoke to Putin before speaking to Zelensky, with European leaders on Thursday scrambling to make clear any peace deal would have to involve Ukraine at the heart of negotiations.

After Trump’s announcement of the peace deal negotiations, French President Emmanuel Macron also described his return to the White House as an “electroshock” for Europe in an interview with the Financial Times.

Macron underlined the need for Europe to strengthen its economy and defenses, agreeing with Trump’s stance that Ukraine’s security was a European responsibility. 13, 2025. 13, 2025. But he also emphasized that only Ukraine could negotiate for itself, and that any peace that was a “capitulation” would be bad news for everyone.

"There are any number of formulations, of configurations, but we do care about Ukraine having sovereign independence,” he said.

U.S. Vice President JD Vance visits Dachau Concentration Camp Memorial Site in Dachau, Germany February 13, 2025. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told [Ukraine's military allies](/world/europe/us-defense-chief-hegseth-says-return-ukraines-pre-2014-borders-not-realistic-2025-02-12/)
 in Brussels that a return to Ukraine's pre-2014 borders - before Russia annexed Crimea - was unrealistic and that the U.S. “He’s going to say, ‘Everything is on the table, let’s make a deal.’”

Vance also agreed that Trump might change his mind depending on how the negotiations unfold.

“President Trump could say, look, we don’t want this thing, we might not like this thing, but we’re willing to put it back on the table if the Russians aren’t being good negotiating partners, or there are things that are very important to Ukrainians that we might want to take off the table,” he said.

Feb 13 (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President JD Vance said the U.S. does not see NATO membership for Kyiv as part of a solution.

Ukrainians on Thursday worried that Trump was preparing to sell out their country following his phone call Putin.

Earlier in the day, Trump said that Ukraine would be involved in [peace talks with Russia](/world/eu-warns-against-dirty-deal-ukraine-after-trump-putin-phone-call-2025-02-13/)
. He told reporters at the White House that Ukraine would have a seat at the table during any peace negotiations with Russia over ending the war.

Kyiv said it would be premature to speak with Moscow at a security conference on Friday.

“I think there is a deal that is going to come out of this that’s going to shock a lot of people,” the newspaper quoted Vance as saying.

"The president is not going to go in this with blinders on,” Vance said."

The **Soviet invasion of Manchuria**, formally known as the **Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation**[\[15\]](#cite_note-22)
 or simply the **Manchurian Operation** (Маньчжурская операция) and sometimes **Operation August Storm**,[\[1\]](#cite_note-Glantz-1)
 began on 9 August 1945 with the [Soviet](/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union")
 invasion of the [Empire of Japan](/wiki/Empire_of_Japan "Empire of Japan")
's [puppet state](/wiki/Puppet_state "Puppet state")
 of [Manchukuo](/wiki/Manchukuo "Manchukuo")
, which was situated in Japanese-occupied [Manchuria](/wiki/Manchuria "Manchuria")
. The Japanese did not have any concrete evidence as to when or where any invasion would occur.[\[17\]](#cite_note-Drea-24)
 They had estimated that an attack was not likely before the spring of 1946, but the _[Stavka](/wiki/Stavka "Stavka")
_ had in fact been planning for a mid-August offensive, successfully [concealing the buildup](/wiki/Russian_military_deception "Russian military deception")
 of a force of 90 divisions. The Kwantung Army commanders were engaged in a planning exercise at the time of the invasion, and were away from their forces for the first eighteen hours of conflict.

The Russians treated the Japanese with the utmost cruelty after their deadly attack on Japan's Kwantung Army in Manchuria just days before Japan's surrender.[\[38\]](#cite_note-46)
 Japanese forces were overwhelmed by Soviet attacks. Another group of Japanese women that were with Ikeda Hiroko that on 15 August tried to flee to Harbin but returned to their settlements were raped by Soviet soldiers.[\[79\]](#cite_note-87)

The [Kwantung Army](/wiki/Kwantung_Army "Kwantung Army")
 of the [Imperial Japanese Army](/wiki/Imperial_Japanese_Army "Imperial Japanese Army")
, under General [Otozo Yamada](/wiki/Otozo_Yamada "Otozo Yamada")
, was the major part of the Japanese occupation forces in Manchuria and Korea, and consisted of two Area Armies and three independent armies:[\[1\]](#cite_note-Glantz-1)

*   [First Area Army](/wiki/Japanese_First_Area_Army "Japanese First Area Army")
     (northeastern Manchukuo), including:
    *   [3rd Army](/wiki/Japanese_Third_Army "Japanese Third Army")
        
    *   [5th Army](/wiki/Japanese_Fifth_Army "Japanese Fifth Army")
        
*   [Third Area Army](/wiki/Japanese_Third_Area_Army "Japanese Third Area Army")
     (southwestern Manchukuo), including:
    *   [30th Army](/wiki/Japanese_Thirtieth_Army "Japanese Thirtieth Army")
        
    *   [44th Army](/wiki/Japanese_Forty-Fourth_Army "Japanese Forty-Fourth Army")
        
*   Independent units:
    *   [4th Army](/wiki/Japanese_Fourth_Army "Japanese Fourth Army")
         (an independent field army responsible for northern Manchuria)
    *   [34th Army](/wiki/Japanese_Thirty-Fourth_Army "Japanese Thirty-Fourth Army")
         (an independent field army responsible for the areas between the Third and Seventeenth Area Armies in northern Korea)
    *   [Seventeenth Area Army](/wiki/Japanese_Seventeenth_Area_Army "Japanese Seventeenth Area Army")
         (responsible for Korea; assigned to the Kwantung Army at the eleventh hour, to no avail)

Each _Area Army_ (_Homen Gun_, the equivalent of a [Western](/wiki/Western_world "Western world")
 "army") had headquarters units and units attached directly to the Area Army, in addition to the field armies (the equivalent of a Western corps). Soviet paratroopers destroyed the Kwantung Army from behind its own lines, while Japanese anti-tank shells bounced off the sides of Soviet tanks.[\[39\]](#cite_note-47)
 The Japanese forces in Manchuria retreated in fear.[\[40\]](#cite_note-48)

Japanese troops and able-bodied Japanese men in Manchuria were taken prisoner by the Russians and transported to labor camps in Siberia, where many Japanese men would die.[\[41\]](#cite_note-49)
 From the Russians' perspective, this was seen as revenge for Russia's defeat in the [Russo-Japanese War](/wiki/Russo-Japanese_War "Russo-Japanese War")
 of 1905.[\[42\]](#cite_note-50)
 The stories of how poorly the Soviets treated the Japanese were brought to [Beijing](/wiki/Beijing "Beijing")
 by Japanese evacuees of Manchuria, creating panic among the Japanese population; however, the Russians honored their agreement with Chiang Kai-shek by not entering China proper.[\[43\]](#cite_note-51)

Japanese communication infrastructure was poor, and the Japanese lost communication with forward units very early on."

The Soviet Union invaded the Empire of Japan's puppet state of Manchukuo on August 9, 1945, as part of World War II. The invasion, known as the Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation, caught the Japanese by surprise. The Kwantung Army, the main Japanese force in the area, was unprepared. The Soviets employed a large-scale pincer movement, with the 2nd Far Eastern Front playing a supporting role. The Japanese forces, including the Kwantung Army, were overwhelmed. The Soviets captured Japanese soldiers and civilians, with many being sent to labor camps in Siberia. The invasion resulted in significant casualties and the collapse of Japanese control in the region.

The Russian military has identified 160 priority targets in [Japan](https://www.scmp.com/topics/japan?module=inline&pgtype=article)
 and [South Korea](https://www.scmp.com/topics/south-korea?module=inline&pgtype=article)
 in the event of a conflict with [Nato](https://www.scmp.com/topics/nato?module=inline&pgtype=article)
 expanding into East Asia, according to secret documents obtained by the Financial Times.

While many targets include legitimate military sites like airfields, radar installations and naval installations, the list also features civilian infrastructure such as nuclear power plants, factories, and transport tunnels.

Deliberately attacking such civilian sites, in the same way Russian forces have done in [Ukraine](https://www.scmp.com/topics/ukraine?module=inline&pgtype=article)
, would constitute a war crime, one analyst said.

In a story published on Tuesday, the British paper reported on 29 leaked Russian military documents used for training officers for potential conflicts in northeastern Asia, shared by “Western sources.”

Although the documents are dated from 2008 to 2014, James Brown, an international relations professor at Temple University in Tokyo, who specialises in Russian affairs, told This Week in Asia that the core elements of Russian strategy and targeting data are likely to remain relevant, albeit updated and enhanced with more recent information.

> It’s obvious why radar facilities and airbases would be targets, but nuclear power plants? Road and rail tunnels?

James Brown, analyst

“Of course, the Russians will have plans for targets in the event of a war breaking out because they need to know what they have to hit,” Brown said.

Russian and Chinese naval vessels plan to conduct a joint patrol in the Asia Pacific region, following recent [exercises in the Sea of Japan](/news/2025/8/3/china-and-russia-begin-joint-military-drills-in-sea-of-japan)
, Russia’s official Interfax has reported.

Citing a statement on Wednesday from the Russian Pacific Fleet’s press service, Interfax said that ships from the Russian Navy and China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Navy “will form a new task group to carry out joint patrol missions in the Asia-Pacific region”.

“After replenishing supplies from logistics vessels, the crews of the Russian Navy and the PLA Navy will form a new detachment to carry out joint patrol tasks in the Asia-Pacific region,” the news agency said.

Russia is conducting a series of military exercises with China in response to the build-up of US military potential in the Asia Pacific region, Interfax said, citing Russia’s chief of staff, Valery Gerasimov, in 2022.

Moscow and Beijing have already conducted joint air patrols in the Asia Pacific region since 2019, it added.

The joint patrol announcement comes as the two countries conclude five days of joint naval drills in the Sea of Japan that focused on anti-submarine and air defence missions.

During the final phase of the exercises, Russia’s large anti-submarine ship Admiral Tributs and the corvette Gromky, together with the Chinese destroyers Shaoxing and Urumqi, carried out live-fire drills while crews practised searching for and neutralising a mock enemy submarine, Interfax reported.

Russia’s Pacific Fleet earlier said that the drills were defensive in nature and not directed against any other countries.

The reported formation of the Asia Pacific joint patrol comes as China modernises and upgrades its naval fleet to become a “blue water” force, capable of carrying out long-range operations in the world’s oceans, similar to the United States and other Western forces.

[Russia and China](/news/2024/9/10/china-russia-to-conduct-joint-naval-and-air-drills-this-month)
, which signed a “no-limits” strategic partnership shortly before Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, conduct regular exercises to rehearse coordination between their armed forces and send a deterrent signal to adversaries.

### TEHRAN (Tasnim) - Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova commented on reports that hundreds of prisoners have been mobilized to extinguish fires in the US state of California, pointing to the hypocrisy of the US.

[\- Other Media news -](/en/service/1200/other-media)

Earlier, The Washington Post, citing the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, reported that the state authorities had sent 395 prisoners to fight forest fires. The diplomat noted that in 2023, Washington restricted imports of products from several Chinese companies in an attempt to exclude goods allegedly produced with the help of Uygur forced labor from the US supply chain.

"This raises a logical question: will Congress draft a bill imposing sanctions on California authorities, private companies, and ordinary Americans for using prison labor to put out fires?" she wondered. "We are so sick of this hypocrisy!" Zakharova added.

Wildfires began to spread across Los Angeles County on January 7."

Did Russia offer sanctuary to California residents who lost their homes in the Los Angeles fires? A viral X [post](https://x.com/jacksonhinklle/status/1879042008465183185)
 by Jackson Hinkle—a [regular purveyor](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/11/business/media/jackson-hinkle-israel-gaza-misinformation.html)
 of Russia-related misinformation—claims so.

“BREAKING: RUSSIA has offered shelter & sanctuary to Californians whose livelihoods were DESTROYED in the LA wildfires,” reads the post, which had more than 500,000 views on X as of January 15. 

[Fact Check](https://thedispatch.com/category/fact-check/)

Assessing Claims That Russia Offered Sanctuary to California Fire Victims
=========================================================================

One Russian governor did make an offer, but there are some caveats.

! A single Russian governor said that he would welcome California fire victims to the region of occupied Ukraine he oversees, but only if they don’t support the government in Kyiv.

On Monday, Vladimir Saldo, the governor of the Russian-occupied Kherson oblast region of Ukraine, [told](https://tass.ru/obschestvo/22867057)
 _TASS_—a Russian state-controlled media outlet—that the region would accept any Americans who lost their homes in this month’s California fires. “Despite the ongoing, blatantly anti-Russian policy of the United States, we fully understand that natural disasters don’t care who you are or what you do,” Saldo said, [according to](https://www.rt.com/russia/610836-california-fires-sanctuary-kherson/)
 Russia Today, a Russian state-controlled network that translated the statement into English. Therefore, our region is ready to welcome any American citizen who has lost their home and livelihood.”

That offer comes with a caveat, applying only to Californians who haven’t supported Ukraine since Russia invaded its borders in February 2022. Sutton")

Other Russian Telegram channels are also spreading false or unverified narratives about the southern California fires and the government's response, as well as amplifying critiques from Americans including the president-elect's son, Donald Trump, Jr., Andy Carvin of the Atlantic Council's DFRLab told NPR in an email. The Russian news site [Pravda](https://web.archive.org/web/20250115205032/https://news-pravda.com/world/2025/01/08/963104.html)
, which has been associated with prior Russian information operations, then translates and distributes the Telegram posts.

"Over the last week, Pravda has published at least 350 stories of this type \[based on Telegram messages about the fires\], based on our initial content analysis of the site," Carvin said.

Senate Republican Leader John Thune (R-SD) and Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) have announced committee assignments for the new Congress, including appointments for newly elected members.

On the Finance Committee, which will take the lead in crafting an extension and modification of the 2017 tax law, Senator Roger Marshall (R-KS) is the only new Republican addition to this key committee. He will be joined by fellow freshmen senators Adam Schiff (D-CA), Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-DE), and Angela Alsobrooks (D-MD).

The Commerce, Science, & Transportation Committee, with responsibility for aviation and surface transportation policy, will include Senators Bernie Moreno (R-OH), Tim Sheehy (R-MT), and Curtis. There was significant turnover on the Democratic side, with senators Sanders (I-VT), Smith (D-MN), Lujan (D-NM), Warnock (D-GA), and Welch (D-VT) replacing departing members.

Newly elected John Curtis (R-UT) will be joining the Environment & Public Works Committee, which has jurisdiction over federal highway, water, and environmental infrastructure programs. On the Democratic side, the committee adds newly elected senators Andy Kim (D-NJ) and Blunt Rochester.

Senators Jim Justice (R-WV) and Dave McCormack (R-PA) will join the Energy Committee on the majority side, along with Senator Ruben Gallego (D-AZ) on the minority.

 The next morning on Twitter, Trump called Schiff "Sleazy Adam Schiff, the totally biased Congressman looking into 'Russia'" and called the Russian collusion investigation "the Dem loss excuse".[\[85\]](#cite_note-85)
 Schiff responded on Twitter that the president's "comments and actions are beneath the dignity of the office".[\[86\]](#cite_note-86)

In December 2018, Schiff suggested that Trump associate [Roger Stone](/wiki/Roger_Stone "Roger Stone")
 might have lied to Congress, and said the transcript of his testimony should be forwarded to the Special Counsel.[\[87\]](#cite_note-87)
 In November 2019, Stone was convicted of lying to Congress.[\[88\]](#cite_note-88)

When he became chair of the House Intelligence Committee in 2019, Schiff embarked on a personal mission to investigate Trump's connections to Russia, separate from the Special Counsel investigation.[\[89\]](#cite_note-89)
 He came under fire when he demurred when asked if he would accept it if the Special Counsel's investigation concluded that Trump had not colluded with Russia, saying that he had great confidence in Mueller but that "there may be, for example, evidence of collusion or conspiracy that is clear and convincing, but not proof beyond a reasonable doubt", as is needed for a criminal conviction.[\[90\]](#cite_note-90)

On March 28, 2019, the nine Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee officially called for Schiff to resign due to his allegations that Trump's campaign colluded with Russians in the 2016 election.[\[91\]](#cite_note-91)
 Schiff responded by accusing the Republican members of tolerating "immoral" and "corrupt" conduct by Trump campaign members and administration appointees.[\[92\]](#cite_note-92)
[\[93\]](#cite_note-93)

, his deputy Gabe Sterling, and Arizona House of Representatives speaker [Rusty Bowers](/wiki/Rusty_Bowers "Rusty Bowers")
.[\[123\]](#cite_note-123)
 The second half of the hearing focused on Trump supporters' harassment of and threats to Georgia poll worker [Wandrea' ArShaye Moss](/wiki/Wandrea%27_ArShaye_Moss "Wandrea' ArShaye Moss")
 and her family, which led her to quit her job and go into hiding.[\[124\]](#cite_note-124)

Schiff was interviewed after the hearing by reporters and called the testimony "enormously powerful".[\[125\]](#cite_note-125)
 He added, "The lie lives on, and with it so does the danger."

In April 2018, when asked whether he thought Trump deserved at least partial credit for North Korea's involvement in talks with the U.S., Schiff replied: "I think it's more than fair to say that the combination of the president's unpredictability and indeed his bellicosity had something to do with the North Koreans deciding to come to the negotiating table".[\[99\]](#cite_note-99)

Biden approves nuclear strategy refocusing on China threat – report
===================================================================

This article is more than 1 year old

White House says plan was approved earlier this year and was not a response to a single country or threat

[Joe Biden](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden)
 has approved a US nuclear strategy to prepare for possible coordinated nuclear confrontations with Russia, China and North Korea, according to a New York Times [report](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/us/politics/biden-nuclear-china-russia.html)
 on Tuesday.

On Tuesday, the White House said the president approved the plan earlier this year and it was not a response to a single country or threat.

The spokesperson Sean Savett said that while “the specific text of the guidance is classified, its existence is in no way secret. “It is possible that we will one day look back and see the quarter-century after the cold war as nuclear intermission.”

----------- Zhou said that “it is impossible for Beijing to stand by idly” in the face of deteriorating relations between Russia and the US, but that there was space to strengthen the policies governing the control of nuclear weapons stockpiles.

Zhou argued that nuclear-armed states should declare a “no first use” policy, as so far only China and India have done.

On Tuesday, the Times reported that two senior administration officials had earlier been permitted to allude to the revision in US nuclear strategy without disclosing its existence.

In June, Pranay Vaddi, a senior director of the national security council, [warned](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/17/row-as-nato-chief-hints-at-talks-to-increase-availability-of-nuclear-weapons)
 that “absent a change” in nuclear strategy by China and Russia, the US was prepared to shift from modernisation of existing weapons to expanding its arsenal.

Vaddi also alluded to the highly classified document, saying it emphasised “the need to deter Russia, the PRC \[People’s Republic of China\] and [North Korea](https://www.theguardian.com/world/north-korea)
 simultaneously”.

The last major nuclear arms control agreement with Russia, [New Start](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/31/us-russia-new-start-nuclear-arms-treaty)
, which sets limits on intercontinental-range nuclear weapons, expires in early 2026 with no subsequent agreement in place.

China and Russia are now more politically and economically [aligned](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/23/a-return-to-the-cold-war-putin-and-kim-have-joined-forces-as-global-delinquents)
. But China’s arsenal is thought to be expanding at a much faster pace than any other country’s.

The US-based Arms Control Association said it understood US nuclear weapons strategy and posture remained the same as described in the administration’s 2022 nuclear posture review, and there had been no reorientation away from [Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia)
 and toward China.

Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association, said that while US intelligence estimates suggested China might increase the size of its nuclear arsenal from 500 to 1,000 warheads by 2030, Russia currently had about 4,000 nuclear warheads “and it remains the major driver behind US nuclear strategy”.

Biden approved the revised strategy – called the nuclear employment guidance – in March, according to the Times, but an unclassified notification of the policy change has not yet been presented to Congress.

After years of nuclear arms reduction efforts, the administration has been signalling willingness to expand the US arsenal to counter China and Russia’s nuclear strategies more recently. Last month, Chinese and Russian long-range bombers patrolled together near Alaska for the first time and held live-fire exercises in the South China Sea.

The second US administration official permitted to refer to the document, Vipin Narang, an MIT nuclear strategist who served in the Pentagon, said earlier this month that Biden had “issued updated nuclear weapons employment guidance to account for multiple nuclear-armed adversaries” and for “the significant increase in the size and diversity” of China’s nuclear arsenal.

“It is our responsibility to see the world as it is, not as we hoped or wished it would be,” the Times quoted Narang as saying. [Skip to main content](#maincontent)

China’s president, Xi Jinping, and his US counterpart, Joe Biden, meeting at the G20 summit in Bali, Indonesia, in November 2022. The guidance issued earlier this year is not a response to any single entity, country, nor threat.”

The Times reported that the deterrent policy takes into account a rapid buildup of [China’s nuclear arsenal](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/20/china-expanding-nuclear-arsenal-much-faster-than-predicted-us-report-says)
, which will rival the size and diversity of the US and Russian stockpiles over the next decade. The Russian president, [Vladimir Putin](https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin)
, has [threatened](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/21/russia-begins-tactical-nuclear-weapon-drills-near-ukraine-border)
 to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine.

China’s foreign ministry on Wednesday said that it was “seriously concerned” by the reports and accused the US of “stirring up the so-called ‘China nuclear threat theory’”. In February, the US [warned](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/feb/14/mike-turner-national-security-threat)
 allies that Russia could be planning to put a nuclear weapon into space.

On Tuesday, a retired senior colonel in the Chinese People’s Liberation Army, Zhou Bo, [published a piece](https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/08/20/nuclear-weapons-war-no-first-use-policy/)
 in Foreign Policy arguing that the US and China could still cooperate on nuclear diplomacy."

US shifts nuclear focus to counter China’s growing arsenal
==========================================================

[Amrita Jash](/the-interpreter/contributors/articles/amrita-jash)

Beijing’s nuclear modernisation means its intentions and commitments to non-proliferation will continue to be questioned.

Listen to this article

[_The New York Times_](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/us/politics/biden-nuclear-china-russia.html?unlocked_article_code=1.EU4.WlFr.MEPeOr7CqMnA&smid=url-share)
 has reported that in March, US President Joe Biden approved a highly classified nuclear strategic plan for the United States. The paper goes on to say that for the first time, America’s deterrent strategy has reoriented to focus on China’s rapid expansion in its nuclear arsenal, as it also seeks to prepare for possible coordinated nuclear challenges from China, Russia and North Korea.

This shift in Washington’s policy comes after a Pentagon assessment that over the next decade China’s nuclear arsenal stockpiles will rival the size and diversity of those in the United States and Russia. It has been accused of transferring nuclear and missile technology to proliferators such as Pakistan, North Korea, and Iran, leading the Biden administration to [impose stricter export controls](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-tightens-export-controls-nuclear-power-items-china-2023-08-18/)
 on nuclear materials and technology to China.

These developments underscore that as China’s economic and military power continues to grow, its approach to non-proliferation will likely shape the international security landscape for years to come. The Russia-Ukraine war has only reinforced this idea.

This modernisation also puts a spotlight on China’s commitment to nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation norms.

### [Seoul will struggle to find currency for Pyongyang talks](/the-interpreter/seoul-will-struggle-find-currency-pyongyang-talks)

Without economic incentives or offering entree to the White House, South Korea could find itself sidelined in North Korea diplomacy. In its [Annual Report to Congress](https://media.defense.gov/2023/Oct/19/2003323409/-1/-1/1/2023-MILITARY-AND-SECURITY-DEVELOPMENTS-INVOLVING-THE-PEOPLES-REPUBLIC-OF-CHINA.PDF)
 last year, the US Department of Defence highlighted two key aspects of China’s nuclear capabilities: First, that China has more than 500 active nuclear weapons, exceeding earlier estimates of 400 warheads, and following [earlier assessments](https://media.defense.gov/2022/Nov/29/2003122279/-1/-1/1/2022-Military-AndSecurity-Developments-Involving-The-Peoples-Republic-Of-China.pdf)
 is expected to have a stockpile of about 1,500 warheads by 2035; and second, that in keeping with its modernisation objectives, China is expected to have more than 1,000 operable nuclear weapons by 2030, many of which will probably be “deployed at higher readiness levels”.

A White House spokesperson was careful to say the new plan was “not a response to any single entity, country, nor threat” and that the guidance provided, while secret, was in keeping with actions taken by earlier administrations.

Beijing, however, raised “grave concerns” over the reported plan, with [China’s Foreign Ministry](https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/xw/fyrbt/202408/t20240821_11477550.html)
 declaring “the US has called China a ‘nuclear threat’ and used it as a convenient pretext to shirk its obligation of nuclear disarmament, expand its own nuclear arsenal, and seek absolute strategic predominance.”

China has restated its “no first use” policy, saying it has “no intention to engage in any form of arms race with other countries”, while accusing the United States of being “the primary source of nuclear threats and strategic risks in the world”. Beijing said Washington would be better to make “drastic and substantive cuts to its nuclear arsenal”, and to stop “nuclear sharing” and other “negative moves that undermine global and regional peace and stability”.

As China’s economic and military power continues to grow, its approach to non-proliferation will likely shape the international security landscape for years to come.

Of the nine nuclear-armed powers, China has one of the fastest-growing nuclear arsenals at present. So, to state that China seeks to have parity with the United States or Russia cannot be blithely dismissed. Any increase in China’s nuclear stockpile raises serious concerns, given the opaque nature of the country’s nuclear capabilities and its modernisation ambitions. China’s intentions continue to be guided by Deng Xiaoping’s observations that nuclear force enhancements were necessary “[to earn more say and a higher international status in a coming world order](https://www.academia.edu/23440377/The_Power_of_Prestige_Chinas_Nuclear_Developments_The_Power_of_Prestige_Chinas_Nuclear_Developments)

Content: "plan approved by President Joe Biden in March was to prepare for possible coordinated nuclear confrontations with Russia, China and North Korea.

The highly classified plan for the first time reorients Washington's deterrent strategy to focus on China's rapid expansion in its nuclear arsenal, the _Times_ said.

KCNA said North Korea's foreign ministry "expresses serious concern over and bitterly denounces and rejects the behavior of the U.S."

It added North Korea vowed to push forward the building of nuclear force sufficient and reliable enough to firmly defend its sovereignty.

Pyongyang and Moscow have been allies since North Korea's founding after World War II and have drawn even closer since Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

The United States and Seoul have accused North Korea of providing ammunition and missiles to Russia for its war in Ukraine.

Pyongyang, which has declared itself an "irreversible" nuclear weapons power, has described allegations of supplying weapons to Russia as "absurd."

However, it did thank Russia for using its United Nations veto in March to effectively end monitoring of sanctions violations just as UN experts were starting to probe alleged arms transfers.

China, also a key ally of North Korea, presents itself as a neutral party in Russia's offensive on Ukraine and says it is not sending lethal assistance to either side, unlike the United States and other Western nations.

But it is a close political and economic ally of Russia, and NATO members have branded Beijing a "decisive enabler" of the war.

Moscow has looked to Beijing as an economic lifeline since the Ukraine conflict began, with the two boosting trade to record highs as Russia faces heavy sanctions from the West.

Seoul, South Korea —
