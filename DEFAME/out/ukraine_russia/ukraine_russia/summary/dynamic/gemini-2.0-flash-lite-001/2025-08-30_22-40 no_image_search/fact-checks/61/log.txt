The claim 'Russian President Vladimir Putin has died in an explosion in one of his limousines.' is false.
Justification: While reports from sources like [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/russia-putin-limousine-fire-video-2052846), [Hindustan Times](https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/275000-aurus-senat-limousine-vladimir-putin-goes-up-in-flames-limo-explodes-moscow-assassination-attempt-101743297137628.html), and [Economic Times](https://m.economictimes.com/news/international/world-news/blast-in-one-of-vladimir-putins-official-limousines-triggers-fresh-assassination-concerns/articleshow/119758547.cms) confirm an explosion involving one of Vladimir Putin's limousines, there is no evidence to support the claim that Putin died in the explosion. The reports do not confirm that Putin was in the car at the time of the explosion.

So, the overall veracity is: false
