## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Pro-Kremlin social media accounts spread a baseless narrative that mansions belonging to Ukrainian military officials burned down in the Los Angeles wildfires in January 2025, according to reports from NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2025/01/16/nx-s1-5259842/los-angeles-california-fires-russia-ukraine](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/16/nx-s1-5259842/los-angeles-california-fires-russia-ukraine)) and Houston Public Media ([https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/npr/2025/01/16/nx-s1-5259842/russia-tried-to-use-the-l-a-wildfires-to-spread-anti-ukraine-propaganda/](https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/npr/2025/01/16/nx-s1-5259842/russia-tried-to-use-the-l-a-wildfires-to-spread-anti-ukraine-propaganda/)). The claim was debunked by fact-checkers and described as "Russian propaganda" by the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council's Center for Countering Disinformation.

There is zero evidence to support this claim. ![image 2335](media/2025-08-07_20-30-1754598606-937437.jpg) ![image 2342](media/2025-08-07_20-30-1754598640-955496.jpg)


## Elaboration
The claim is false. The evidence indicates that the claim originated from pro-Kremlin social media accounts and was debunked by fact-checkers. The Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council's Center for Countering Disinformation labeled it as "Russian propaganda." Forbes reported that the claim originated on a Russian Telegram channel and that there is zero evidence to support it.


## Final Judgement
The claim that eight mansions belonging to Ukrainian military officials burned down in the January 2025 Los Angeles wildfires is demonstrably false. Multiple reliable sources, including NPR, Houston Public Media, and Forbes, have debunked the claim, identifying it as Russian propaganda and stating there is no evidence to support it.
