Some NATO troops will also attend Friday's commemoration of the defeat of the Red Army at the Battle of Warsaw.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A large military parade will take place in Warsaw on Friday to commemorate Poland's victory there against the Red Army in 1920.

The celebrations will be attended by nearly 4,000 Polish soldiers as well as almost 200 army representatives from allied countries including the US and the UK.

The events to mark Polish Army Day will include a wreath-laying ceremony led by Poland's President Karol Nawrocki and his wife Marta.

For the first time, a naval parade in the Baltic Sea will also be held, with 20 ships as well as hydrographic and rescue vessels appearing in the waters around Hel.

**Great show of force in Warsaw and on the Baltic**
---------------------------------------------------

The main highlight of the celebrations, however, will be the military parade on Warsaw's Wisłostrada, which will begin at midday.

"We will be showing the most modern equipment at the disposal of the Polish Armed Forces," spokesperson for the General Staff of the Polish Army Colonel Joanna Klejszmit told Euronews.

Tanks as well as lighter vehicles will be used in the procession, she added.

F-16 aircraft and AH-64 Apache helicopters will also be on display, as will Himars rocket launchers, according to Poland's defence ministry.

The airshow will feature the Australian Army's E-7A Wedgetail early-warning aircraft.

"We will be joined for the first time ever by soldiers from Australia. They are stationed in Poland with their early reconnaissance aircraft, so there will really be something to see," said Colonel Klejszmit.

During the dress rehearsal, Deputy Prime Minister Kosiniak-Kamysz emphasised the special role of France, recalling that the support of French commanders was crucial to the Polish victory at the Battle of Warsaw.

"This is special, because the Battle of Warsaw also with the participation of French troops, the support of French generals, commanders, could have been victorious, so we will thank our allies as well," Kosiniak-Kamysz explained.

The two events — the parade and the naval parade — will start at the same time and will be broadcast live.

In an interview with Euronews, Lieutenant Colonel Michał Tomczyk said interest in the military is growing year on year, especially given the current security concerns in Europe over Russia's all-out war in Ukraine.

He noted that 15 August is the time when many people express their desire to join the army.

"In fact, every garrison in Poland organises its Polish Army Day. There, there will be an opportunity to talk to military personnel and ask about recruitment or particular training courses," he said.

On Saturday, the celebrations will continue with the ceremonial opening of the Museum of the Battle of Warsaw 1920 in Ossów.

Poland currently spends over 4% of its GDP on defence and, with 216,100 military personnel, has the third largest army in NATO.

WARSAW, Poland (AP) — NATO member Poland paid tribute Thursday to its historic 1920 victory over the Red Army by honoring fallen Poles and showing off modern tanks and other equipment that it hopes will deter [the threat it sees in modern-day Russia](https://apnews.com/article/poland-self-defense-security-ukraine-russia-war-06569fdb6f4792fd0b919a24e1d6bef1)
.

More than 2,500 Polish troops, joined by dozens of U.S. Since Poland broke free of Moscow’s control starting in 1989 and then joined NATO, it has worked to modernize its army.

Those efforts moved into higher gear after Russia, under President Vladimir Putin, first invaded parts of Ukraine in 2014, and then began its full-fledged assault in 2022, with fears heightened all along the strategic stretch of NATO’s eastern flank — from the Baltic nations to Poland to Romania.
