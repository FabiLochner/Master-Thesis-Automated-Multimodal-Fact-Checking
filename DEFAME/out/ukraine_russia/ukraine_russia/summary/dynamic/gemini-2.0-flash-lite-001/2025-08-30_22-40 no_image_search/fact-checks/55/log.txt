The claim 'E! News reported that the United States Agency Aid and Development (USAID) paid millions for celebrities to visit Ukraine.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. Multiple sources, including BBC News ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0m12wl0jwpo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0m12wl0jwpo)) and The Hollywood Reporter ([https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/politics-news/fake-online-usaid-paid-hollywood-stars-debunked-1236129713/](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/politics-news/fake-online-usaid-paid-hollywood-stars-debunked-1236129713/)), debunked the allegation that USAID paid celebrities to visit Ukraine, identifying it as part of a disinformation campaign. Ben Stiller denied the claims, stating he self-funded his trip. The evidence does not mention E! News as a source.
