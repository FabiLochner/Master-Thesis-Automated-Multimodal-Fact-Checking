Remarks
=======

by NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte with the President of the United States of America, Donald J. Which is totally logical, and this is building on the tremendous success of the NATO Summit, the 5% but also the decision to keep Ukraine strong and the decision to increase our defense industrial production.

  
So based on that, that was Europe stepping up. So if I was Vladimir Putin today, and are you speaking about what you were planning to do in 50 days, and this announcement, I would reconsider whether I should not take negotiations about Ukraine more seriously than I was doing at the moment, if I was Vladimir Putin. Trump at the White House
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   14 Jul. And the decision is that you want Ukraine what it needs to have to maintain to be able to defend itself against Russia, but you do want Europeans to pay for it. I can tell you that at this moment Germany massively, but also Finland and Denmark and Sweden and Norway, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Canada: They all want to be part of this.

And this is only the first wave. There will be more.

So what we will do is work through the NATO systems to make sure that we know what Ukrainians need. So if we can make packages, of course, in a way, we discussed it this morning with Pete Hegseth at the Pentagon, in a way that, of course, the US will keep on its stockpiles necessary to defend this country, that's absolutely clear.

But it will mean that Ukraine can get its hands on really massive numbers of military equipment, both for air defense, but also missiles, ammunition, etc, etc. But when I'm Ukraine, I think this is really great news for them.

So I really want to thank you for that, and it means Europeans paying for it.

And again, I mentioned all these countries, we will deal with that. And exactly as you said, that might also mean that countries will move equipment fast into Ukraine and then the US later, backfilling it, because speed is of the essence here.

So really, thank you this is important.

MOSCOW and KYIV — President Trump on Monday threatened to punish Russia with heavy tariffs on countries that trade with Moscow if the Kremlin fails to reach a ceasefire deal with Ukraine by September, while promising Kyiv billions of dollars worth of military equipment.

"We're going to be doing very severe tariffs if we don't have a deal in 50 days," Trump said during a White House meeting with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte. "Tariffs at about 100%, you'd call them secondary tariffs."

It was his latest warning against Russian President Vladimir Putin, as Trump becomes increasingly frustrated with the Kremlin leader over his continued war in Ukraine.

President Trump explained that NATO countries would acquire U.S.-made weapons, including Patriot air defense missile systems, and that those countries would provide them to Ukraine.

Speaking Sunday to reporters ahead of the meeting with Rutte, Trump cast the weapons deals as a direct rebuke to Putin. <image:1883>

 a sanctions on/off switch to use as snap leverage with Moscow.

Collectively, the moves cap a stark turnaround in Trump's approach toward President Putin over the Ukraine issue. Trump's frustrations with Russia today might be directed at Ukraine tomorrow.

"Why should they ruin relations completely?" Sergey Poletaev, of the Moscow-based Vatfor analytical platform, said in an interview with NPR.

"In another six months or so, the pendulum could swing back the other way."

"The fact remains that the supply of weapons, ammunition and military equipment from the United States continued and continues to Ukraine," Peskov told reporters.

Russia's main market index jumped on the news that Trump would delay additional sanctions for at least 50 days, during which Trump said he expected Russia to negotiate a peace deal.

Yet several prominent Russian nationalists seized on that timeframe, saying it provided Russia a new deadline for a battlefield victory.

Still, political observers in Moscow recalled the Kremlin is dealing with a mercurial American president. Trump has gone from initially promising he could leverage his personal relationship with Putin to negotiate a quick peace agreement, to now openly criticizing the Kremlin leader as unserious in negotiations to end the war.

While NATO's statement did not state a reason for Rutte's trip, it comes after Mr. leader announcing plans to sell NATO allies weapons that it can pass on to Ukraine.

In a statement, NATO said Rutte will be in Washington on Monday and Tuesday and will also meet with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and members of Congress.

[! Trump teased last week that he would make a "major statement" on Russia on Monday, as Ukraine struggles to repel massive and complex air assaults launched by Russian forces. 

The president also hinted that his administration will send more defensive weapons to Ukraine amid its war with Russia, days after [pausing](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-halting-some-weapons-shipments-ukraine/)
 some weapons shipments.

"We're going to send some more weapons. The Europeans want to limit the interest on the assets to go to Ukraine." 

Rubio said Friday that some of the U.S.-made weapons that Ukraine is seeking are deployed with NATO allies in Europe. It would have an enormous impact on economic behemoths China and India, which account for roughly 70% of Russia's energy trade.

Graham said he and Blumenthal have support for "congressional sanctions with a sledgehammer" that will "go after" Russian President Vladimir Putin's economy and "all those countries who prop up the Putin war machine."

"This congressional package that we're looking at would give President Trump the ability to impose 500% tariffs on any country that helps Russia, and props up Putin's war machine," Graham said. Trump is considering authorizing fresh funding for Ukraine for the first time since he took office in January.

The sources indicated the new funding could be intended to send a message to Russia. Trump has $3.85 billion in leftover Biden-era presidential drawdown authority sitting at his fingertips, which could be used to send American military equipment to Ukraine."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that Mark Rutte and Donald Trump met after Trump won the US presidential election in 2024. The discussions involved Ukraine, with Trump considering providing weapons and potentially authorizing funding. However, the provided evidence does not contain any statement from Mark Rutte about expelling the United States from NATO if Trump surrenders Ukraine to Putin.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence.

The evidence indicates that Mark Rutte and Donald Trump met after Trump won the US presidential election in 2024. The discussions involved Ukraine, with Trump considering providing weapons and potentially authorizing funding. However, the provided evidence does not contain any statement from Mark Rutte about expelling the United States from NATO if Trump surrenders Ukraine to Putin.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence.

The discussions involved Ukraine, with Trump considering providing weapons and potentially authorizing funding. However, the provided evidence does not contain any statement from Mark Rutte about expelling the United States from NATO if Trump surrenders Ukraine to Putin.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence.

Since Donald Trump's reelection, claims have circulated on social media that the US will be pushed out of NATO if it fails to support Ukraine against the Russian invasion.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](https://static.euronews.com/website/images/logos/logo-euronews-stacked-outlined-72x72-grey-9.svg) ADVERTISEMENT

A claim on social media network Threads alleges that Mark Rutte, secretary-general of NATO, has threatened to expel the US from the alliance if president-elect Donald Trump "surrenders Ukraine to \[Russian President Vladimir\] Putin".

The fear that a Trump victory in November's US presidential election could lead to reduced support for Ukraine — or even surrender to the Russian invasion — has long been a concern for NATO and the wider European continent.

Throughout his presidential campaign and even before, Trump was a vocal critic of the support the US was sending to Kyiv and consistently claimed he could quickly end the war once in office, which many have interpreted as him pressuring Ukraine to give up the territory that Russia has occupied in exchange for peace.

Nevertheless, Trump is not yet in power so the current situation has not changed, and there's no evidence that Rutte has said anything about expelling the US from NATO, even if Trump does decide to reduce support.

NATO does not have a specific mechanism to suspend or expel a member. A spokesperson told EuroVerify that it was a "bogus" claim.

Nevertheless, Rutte and other NATO leaders seem keen to stress to Trump that Russia's invasion of Ukraine is a danger to the US too, following the president-elect's comments during the campaign that he would withdraw support for Kyiv.

In response to questions from journalists at the EPC summit, Rutte said that any Russian success in Ukraine would not just threaten Europe, but the US too.

"Collectively, we have to work not only the threat of Russia, but also the fact that these four countries \[China, Iran, North Korea and Russia\] work together and that now, very soon, we will see that also the US itself is under threat from these newest technological developments, thanks to Russia giving its latest insights and technology to the North Koreans," he said.

What has Trump previously said about NATO, Russia and Ukraine?
--------------------------------------------------------------

The worry about Trump's lack of commitment to Ukraine stems from his previous incendiary comments about Kyiv and NATO, in addition to his apparent admiration for Putin.

He has mocked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's supposed ability to secure US funds, called NATO "obsolete" and has suggested he would not help if Russia tried to invade other NATO allies.

"Every time Zelenskyy comes to the United States he walks away with $100 billion, I think he's the greatest salesman on Earth," Trump said during a campaign event in the state of Georgia.

In reality, the US has given around $60 billion (€57 billion) in military assistance to Ukraine since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022.

At another event at the beginning of the year, the president-elect said that he told "one of the presidents of a big \[NATO\] country" last time he was in office that he would not protect them if they weren't paying their way and Russia attacked.

"In fact, I would encourage them \[Russia\] to do whatever the hell they want," Trump said. The Kremlin denies that this call took place.

If anything, all of Rutte's public statements about Trump since the US presidential election have referred to them working closely together.

Immediately following the election result, which saw Trump triumph over Kamala Harris to win a second term in office, Rutte took to X to say that he had congratulated the incoming president on his victory.

"His leadership will again be key to keeping our Alliance strong," the former Dutch prime minister said, adding he looked forward to working with him again.

A day later, he posted again on X saying more or less the same, noting that this time he'd personally congratulated Trump.

NATO's website also contains a longer official statement from Rutte.

In the statement, he reminds Trump that "through NATO, the US has 31 friends and allies who help to advance US interests, multiply American power and keep Americans safe".

"President-elect Trump demonstrated strong US leadership throughout his first term in office — a term that turned the tide on European defence spending, improved transatlantic burden sharing, and strengthened Alliance capabilities," Rutte said.

He also said that Trump will see a "stronger, larger, more united alliance" when he takes office again on 20 January, noting that two-thirds of NATO now spend at least 2% of their GDP on defence and that defence spending and production are on an upward trajectory across the alliance.

Trump repeatedly blasted NATO allies last time he was president for not meeting the 2% defence spending target and even suggested raising it to 4%.

As of June this year, out of the 32 NATO members, Croatia, Portugal, Italy, Canada, Belgium, Luxembourg, Slovenia and Spain were the countries not meeting the 2% commitment, according to the most recent figures.

Poland, Estonia and the US were the biggest spenders, sitting at 4.12%, 3.43% and 3.38% respectively.

At a European Political Community (EPC) summit in Budapest earlier in November, Rutte actually credited Trump for NATO's move towards higher defence spending.

"When he was president he was the one in NATO who stimulated us to move over the 2% and now also thanks to him, in NATO, if you take out the numbers of the US for a moment, is above the 2% and I think very much that is his doing, his success, and we need to do more," Rutte told journalists.

Russian victory threatens US as much as Europe
----------------------------------------------

For good measure, NATO itself has denied that Rutte ever threatened to expel the US. You got to pay your bills."

In February 2022, Trump praised Putin as a "genius" and "savvy" for the way he launched the invasion.

However, the Wall Street Journal reported that Trump rang Putin shortly after his reelection to warn him against escalating the war."

However, the provided evidence does not contain any statement from Mark Rutte about expelling the United States from NATO if Trump surrenders Ukraine to Putin.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence.

 As uncertainty in U.S.–Ukraine relations grows, informal ties with some U.S. Buffett, a Republican and son of billionaire investor Warren Buffett. He’s making his 18th visit to Ukraine since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. We’re on track,” Buffett told The Associated Press, adding that his foundation will surpass $1 billion in aid to Ukraine this year. So, we’ll stick with it as long as we need to.”

The AP caught up with Buffett aboard a train with Ukraine’s Economy Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko on Saturday. Svyrydenko calls him “one of the greatest friends of Ukraine.”

Buffett is [among a number of Americans](https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-russia-war-be08b99bf75e99de991557ac18c7bf15)
 across the U.S. hasn’t done enough to help Ukraine defeat Russia over the past few years.

On this trip, Buffett and Svyrydenko traveled to the country’s northern Sumy region, where the situation has significantly worsened following Ukrainian forces’ loss of ground in Russia’s Kursk region.

They visited the villages of Popivka and Bobryk, which — like much of the region — lie in a high-risk zone for land mines. They also stopped at a local school that had been relocated to a basement, where children now study during hours-long air raid alerts.

Buffett’s foundation, which focuses on humanitarian needs like agriculture, infrastructure and mine clearance, has contributed about $800 million to Ukraine since the start of the full-scale invasion, including $175 million in humanitarian demining."

**US philanthropist Howard Buffett has kept up funding Ukraine with informal arrangements, even amidst deteriorating relations between the two nations since President Donald Trump’s election into office.** 

The son of billionaire Warren Buffett and longtime Republican Party supporter made his 18th visit to Ukraine in three years via a train trip in April, underscoring his funding support. 

Buffett told the Associated Press that Trump’s apparent closeness with Russia and clampdown on military support for Ukraine has not altered his foundation’s support in Ukraine. 

‘It doesn’t change anything we do. Howard Buffett maintains Ukraine philanthropy despite deteriorating US support 
===============================================================================

! We’re on track,’ he said. 

Howard Buffett’s foundation aims to surpass the $1 billion giving mark this year for Ukraine. 

So far, the Buffett Foundation has provided $800 million in aid and funding towards clearing mines and boosting agriculture and local infrastructure.  

Ukraine’s agricultural sector has lost 20.5 per cent of farmland since the full-scale invasion in February 2022.  

And some 139,000 square kilometres of land — about the size of the state of New York — are potentially mined. A similar trip is expected in May. 

In a video posted by the Associated Press, Buffett was joined by Ukraine’s Economy Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko. The pair have established close relations, with Svyrydenko describing Buffett as ‘one of the greatest friends of Ukraine.’ 

Buffett also scorned the possibility of a peace deal, calling it ‘impossible’ given Trump’s pivoting towards the Kremlin and Putin’s reluctance. 

“At the end of the day, I think the US will do the right thing, but it may be a painful process and there may be a lot more Ukrainians that die,” he said.

Your email address will not be published. Two-thirds of that is fertile farmland belonging to Ukrainian farmers who have sowed wheat for generations. 

The foundation also funded bipartisan trips for US lawmakers to visit Ukraine in 2023."

Howard G. The fighting persists despite initial ceasefire attempts, and it remains uncertain whether the US will continue its support for Ukraine in repelling Russia’s invasion.

Speaking to AP, Buffett confirmed his foundation’s ongoing commitment to Ukraine, saying that the political situation in the US will not affect their support.

> _“It doesn’t change anything we do. Buffett’s commitment includes addressing critical needs such as agriculture, infrastructure, and humanitarian demining, with a focus on areas heavily affected by landmines.

Buffett traveled with Ukraine’s Minister of Economy Yuliia Svyrydenko to visit Sumy Oblast, which has seen a worsening situation following the Ukrainian forces’ loss of ground in the adjacent Russian Kursk Oblast. 

Buffett’s foundation has already contributed around $800 million to Ukraine since the invasion began, with $175 million dedicated to humanitarian demining efforts. Since the war’s start, mine-related incidents have [killed](https://apnews.com/article/cyprus-ukraine-landmines-explosive-ordnance-demining-munitions-45aaa2eb9ac4d1dd9e94d3a8b666d1d1)
 335 people and injured 823.

Despite challenges in US–Ukraine relations, Buffett remains confident that many US lawmakers continue to support Ukraine’s fight for sovereignty. He believes the US will “_do the right thing_,” although he acknowledges the painful process ahead.

Warren Buffett's son Howard has given $500M to Ukraine — he warns the US is making a historic mistake by pulling its support
============================================================================================================================

By [Rebecca Rommen](https://www.businessinsider.com/author/rebecca-rommen)

!Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Howard Buffett in Kyiv, Ukraine. Log in.

*   Business Insider interviewed Warren Buffett's son about his  support for Ukraine. 
*   Howard Buffett's foundation has given $520 million to Ukraine in humanitarian aid.
*   The philanthropist warns the US will make a historic blunder if it fails to support Ukraine's war effort.

Two years after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the embattled nation needs its friends more than ever.

Russia celebrated [a landmark victory](https://www.businessinsider.com/ukraine-troops-pull-out-key-eastern-town-avdiivka-russia-2024-2?r=US&IR=T)
 when it captured the eastern town of Avdiivka last week, and it is [running low on artillery ammunition.](https://www.businessinsider.com/ukraines-ammo-problems-hinder-ability-fire-at-russian-targets-2024-2?r=US&IR=T)
 Meanwhile, a $60 billion military aid package is snarled up in Congress due to opposition from some Republican Party lawmakers.

But Howard Buffett, the elder son of Warren, the billionaire investor and Berkshire Hathaway CEO, has no intention of forsaking Ukraine or its President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

The wartime leader and American philanthropist have a profound mutual respect.

Buffett told Business Insider, "There are very few people in the world that could step up" and do what Zelenskyy's done. And it's going to be one of the biggest mistakes that the United States makes historically if we don't continue to support Ukraine.

"The most frustrating part is to watch the narrative in the US because you have congressmen and senators whose constituencies or districts are benefiting from this war," he said.

Putting his money where his mouth is, Buffett said another $300 million is budgeted for Ukraine this year, and for the last two years, the foundation exceeded the budgeted number.

The foundation is largely funded by his father, Warren Buffett's contributions. [Warren Buffett is the seventh richest person](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/?embedded-checkout=true)
 in the world, boasting a net worth of $138 billion.

'You have to step up big'

In December, [Zelenskyy and Howard Buffett visited a Kyiv plaza](https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/volodimir-zelenskij-i-govard-baffet-vidkrili-na-aleyi-smiliv-87821)
 adorned with plaques honoring Ukraine's most steadfast supporters during Russia's full-scale invasion to show the US philanthropist that his name is also etched on the "Walk of the Brave."

Zelenskyy told Buffett: "You are among these world leaders — friends of Ukraine."

Buffett calls the war the "largest humanitarian crisis" that he's witnessed in his lifetime.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Buffett Foundation has emerged as a stalwart ally to Ukraine since Russia's full-scale invasion, injecting $521,779,225 into humanitarian assistance for Ukraine as of January 2024.

The US and its 'Ukraine fatigue' problem
----------------------------------------

"The guy's got to be worn out," Buffett said of Zelenskyy. So to me, he's somebody who has stepped up and done a job that I think very few people could do," said Buffett.

"I don't think anybody could have done a better job," he said, observing that "it's an incredible force that he's up against."

While Buffett worries about Zelenskyy's exhausting schedule and sleepless nights, he is also concerned about "Ukraine fatigue" affecting its most important ally, the United States.

He warned against it last year and continues stressing the importance of supporting the war effort.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Warren Buffett's son, Howard Buffett, is on track to donate $1 billion in aid to Ukraine this year, according to reports. His foundation has already provided $800 million in aid since the start of the full-scale invasion, with the aim of surpassing the $1 billion mark this year.

The argument came at the end of a lengthy question-and-answer session with reporters, after Trump defended his [approach with Russian President Vladimir Putin](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/18/nx-s1-5300669/us-russia-ukraine-saudi-arabia-summit)

As the two leaders raised their voices, each trying to speak over the other, Zelenskyy said, "You will feel influence."

Trump took to social media after the exchange, [writing on his Truth Social](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114082877976878390)
 platform that he had "determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for peace."

Zelenskyy addressed the tense exchange during an interview on Fox News, telling host Bret Baier that Ukraine was in fact "ready for peace," while repeatedly stressing the importance of security guarantees for his country.

The Ukrainian leader said it was regrettable that the exchange occurred in front of cameras and not behind closed doors. I'm thankful to President Trump and to Congress, bipartisan support, and I was always very thankful for all our people," he said.

He declined to answer directly when pressed on whether he owed President Trump an apology, but when asked whether his relationship with President Trump could be salvaged, Zelenskyy told Baier, "Yes, of course."

### "The free world needs a new leader"

It marked a dramatic shift in the reception of Ukraine's leader in Washington, drawing criticism from top Democratic lawmakers. 

"President Trump and his administration continue to embarrass America on the world stage," House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., [said in a statement](https://jeffries.house.gov/2025/02/28/leader-jeffries-statement-on-white-house-meeting-with-president-zelensky/)

A potential deal between the United States and Ukraine intended to pave the way for an end to the war with Russia was up in the air Friday, after a meeting between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office on Friday grew contentious.

Trump told Zelenskyy, "You're not acting at all thankful" for the support Zelenskyy's country had received from the United States, adding that the Ukrainian leader had been disrespectful and telling him, "You're gambling with World War III."

===================================================================================

The bitter exchange was unlike any other in the Oval Office in modern times.

By[Alexandra Hutzler](https://abcnews.go.com/author/alexandra_hutzler)

February 28, 2025, 4:00 PM

With Ukraine's future in the balance, a high-stakes meeting on Friday between President [Donald Trump](https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/donald-trump)
 and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy devolved into a shouting match.

The stunning exchange, before cameras and one unlike any other in the Oval Office in modern times, saw Trump and Vice President JD Vance rebuke Zelenskyy for his handling of the war, again falsely blaming the Ukrainian leader for a conflict that began when Russia's Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion.

Zelenskyy was in Washington to sign an agreement that would give the U.S. But that was before boiling tensions exploded into public view as Trump and Vance accused Zelenskyy of being "disrespectful" toward the [United States](https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/us-military)
 and the Trump administration.

"He made it hard for the American people to believe he is a good investment," he added. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., Chris Coons, D-Del., and Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., as well as other Democratic and Republican senators, gathered for an hourlong "encouraging" meeting with Zelenskyy ahead of his visit to the White House, the three lawmakers posted on their social media accounts.

Graham said he urged Zelenskyy ahead of the meeting with Trump not to "take the bait," but he wasn't the only one, sources told ABC News. They noted that Graham was very blunt, telling Zelenskyy to "suck up a bit" and thank the president extensively.

But senators on both sides of the aisle tried to provide Zelenskyy with "friendly coaching," according to two people who were in the room during the bipartisan meeting with the Ukrainian leader.

# Instructions
You are provided with the record of a fact-check. It contains the Claim to be verified and a documentation of all the fact-checking work along the gathered evidence. Your task is to **summarize the fact-check**. That is, you provide a concise, one-paragraph justification for the final VERDICT based on the knowledge from the Record. Note:
* Be truthful, brief, do not add any additional information besides the information given in the Record. 
* Link key sources in your summary. Use Markdown notation for that. You may link them in-line.
* Don't state the Claim again. Rather focus on the key insights of the fact-check.
* Simply print just the summary.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "On Feb. 28, 2025, before a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with Democrats."

## Actions
```
web_search("Volodymyr Zelenskyy Donald Trump meeting February 28 2025")
web_search("Volodymyr Zelenskyy meeting with Democrats February 28 2025")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
On February 28, 2025, Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with Donald Trump in the Oval Office at the White House, as reported by [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Trump%E2%80%93Zelenskyy_Oval_Office_meeting), [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5313079/trump-zelenskyy-meeting) and [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/key-takeaways-tempers-flare-trump-vance-confront-ukraines/story?id=119299758). The meeting was contentious, with reports of heated exchanges and criticism from Democratic lawmakers. <image:i>, <image:9028>, <image:9025>, <image:9024>, <image:9034>, <image:9039>, <image:9035>, <image:9041>


### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/zelenskyy-meets-bipartisan-group-senators-ahead-tense-white/story?id=119305439): 
Content: ABC News reports that on February 28, 2025, Zelenskyy met with a bipartisan group of senators before meeting with Donald Trump. <image:9049> The article was published on March 1, 2025, and was written by Isabella Murray and Rachel Scott.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Zelenskyy met with Donald Trump on February 28, 2025. Furthermore, the evidence from ABC News indicates that Zelenskyy met with a bipartisan group of senators before his meeting with Trump on the same day.

Therefore, the claim is likely true, as the evidence supports the assertion that Zelenskyy met with Democrats (as part of a bipartisan group) before his meeting with Trump.


## Final Judgement
The claim is supported by evidence from multiple reliable sources. The search results confirm that Zelenskyy met with Donald Trump on February 28, 2025, and also met with a bipartisan group of senators, which would include Democrats, before the meeting with Trump.

`true`


## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
On February 28, 2025, Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with Donald Trump, as reported by [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Trump%E2%80%93Zelenskyy_Oval_Office_meeting), [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5313079/trump-zelenskyy-meeting), and [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/key-takeaways-tempers-flare-trump-vance-confront-ukraines/story?id=119299758). ABC News also reported that Zelenskyy met with a bipartisan group of senators before the meeting with Trump, thus supporting the claim that he met with Democrats before the meeting.

[Joe Rogan](https://globalnews.ca/tag/joe-rogan/)
 said he will not be attending an upcoming [UFC](https://globalnews.ca/tag/ufc/)
 fight in Montreal because he doesn’t “go to Canada anymore” and joked that he would “rather go to Russia.”

! He’s a sketchy guy,” Rogan said on the podcast.

Rogan also said Trudeau has “some shaky deals” and added that he would “like to see where the money is coming from.” It is still unclear what deals Rogan was referring to.

Rogan claimed that Canadian authorities froze bank accounts of people who “only donated to the truckers” and that people are “still in jail” for their participation.

“It was kind of when a lot of people woke up,” Rogan added.

This isn’t the first time Rogan has criticized Canada on the podcast.

In March, Rogan [said he didn’t love Trump’s idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8)

Back in July 2022, Rogan [had some strong words about Canada and Trudeau](https://globalnews.ca/news/8997721/joe-rogan-canada-communist-justin-trudeau-sketchy-dictator/)
, voicing his distaste for the country’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Canada’s communist,” Rogan said on the podcast. <image:2033>

The UFC commentator shared his thoughts on [his podcast, _The Joe Rogan Experience_](https://www.youtube.com/live/Xr-DqSmJEXI?si=Q3f-0swafwYpFl0G)
, when asked if he will be in attendance to watch UFC fighter Belal Muhammad defend his Welterweight gold against Jack Della Maddalena in May.

When Rogan asked his guests Gordon Ryan, Brendan Schaub and Eddie Bravo when the fight is set to take place, they said, “About two months.”

“Where’s that at?” Rogan asked.

_The Joe Rogan Experience_ producer Jamie Vernon told Rogan that the fight will be held in Montreal at UFC 315 on May 10.

“Wow, I won’t be there."

Content: "I’d rather go to Russia,” he said, laughing.

Earlier in the show, Rogan remarked that Canada’s government is “terrible” — but said “the Canadian people are awesome.” 

Rogan said in July that his beef with Canada initially began during the COVID-19 pandemic after thousands of protesting truckers [descended on the capital in Ottawa](https://nypost.com/2022/02/14/canadas-trudeau-invokes-emergency-powers-to-quell-protests/)
 and railed against the country’s vaccine mandate, [according to Front Office Sports](https://frontofficesports.com/joe-rogan-canada-massive-ufc-315-event/)
.

President Trump, who Rogan helped throttle to a second term in the White House with an appearance on his podcast days before the 2024 election, has sparked tensions between the US and Canada for [imposing new tariffs](https://nypost.com/2025/03/23/world-news/canadian-pm-mark-carney-calls-snap-election-slams-trump-trade-war/)
 — and suggesting Canada become the 51st state.

The trade war has previously seeped into the sports world, with Canadian fans booing the US national anthem during the NHL-run 4 Nations Face-Off tournament.

Rogan [admitted last month](https://nypost.com/2025/03/22/us-news/joe-rogan-doesnt-want-canada-to-be-us-51st-state/)
 that he does not think Canada should join the union, but wants the two countries to make up and end what he called “the dumbest f–king feud.”

 [!Rogan after a lightweight fight during the UFC 313 event at T-Mobile Arena on March 08, 2025 in Las Vegas, Nevada. UFC commentator Joe Rogan said he won’t go to an upcoming fight because it’s in Canada — joking that he’d “rather go to Russia.”

Rogan gave the brush off on his podcast, “The Joe Rogan Experience,” when asked about UFC 315 in May being in Montreal.

“Wow. I don’t go to Canada anymore,” he said, having previously spoken out against the Great White North’s spat with President Trump.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

**Rumor – Vladimir Putin allegedly demanded the extradition of Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci for crimes related to the pandemic as a condition to end the conflict in Ukraine.**

Analysis

Denialist and conspiratorial content involving public figures such as Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci continues to circulate on conspiracy websites.

These publications often reinforce theories of the so-called “new world order,” deny the severity of the Covid-19 pandemic, and portray authoritarian leaders as “saviors” in a battle against global elites. Another example is the false claim that [he was arrested for child trafficking](https://www.boatos.org/mundo/bill-gates-preso-exercito-americano-trafico-de-criancas-outros-crimes.html)
, which was also completely fabricated.

Conclusion

It is false that Vladimir Putin demanded the extradition of Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci as a condition to end the war with Ukraine. Given this, let’s answer the following questions: 1) Did Putin request the extradition of Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci to end the war in Ukraine? 3) Are Gates and Fauci facing any legal actions in Russia?

Did Putin request the extradition of Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci to end the war in Ukraine?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

No. A post claims that Putin demanded the extradition of Bill Gates and Fauci to be tried in Russia for bioterrorism and crimes against humanity.

According to the story, this would be the condition imposed by the Russian president to end the war in Ukraine. There is no official record — whether from the Russian government, credible media, or diplomatic sources — that Vladimir Putin ever made any extradition request involving Bill Gates or Anthony Fauci. These demands have been detailed in reports by [Veja](https://veja.abril.com.br/mundo/as-condicoes-que-putin-pode-impor-ao-acordo-de-cessar-fogo-com-ucrania/)
, [G1](https://g1.globo.com/jornal-nacional/noticia/2025/03/13/vladimir-putin-condiciona-cessar-fogo-com-a-ucrania-a-uma-serie-de-exigencias-como-manter-definitivamente-territorios-que-invadiu.ghtml)
 and [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/14/what-are-putins-conditions-for-a-ceasefire-in-ukraine)
.

Are Gates and Fauci facing any legal action in Russia?
------------------------------------------------------

No. Read:

_Putin demands extradition of Gates and Fauci to face Russian justice for Bioterrorism! It is a work of fiction with no basis in concrete facts or verifiable statements.

What are Putin’s actual conditions to end the war in Ukraine?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Putin’s real conditions for a ceasefire or to end the war in Ukraine have been disclosed multiple times. In this scenario, Vladimir Putin is often depicted as the central figure of an alleged resistance.

Recently, one of these stories has resurfaced."

!Kias are the most targeted by car burglars in Austin <image:9964>

#### [Kias are the most targeted by car burglars in Austin](/video/1608052)

Austin police said the people responsible for killing a writer for the conspiracy website, InfoWars, were breaking into his Kia when they shot him. Statistics show in Texas, Kias are one of the top brands targeted by car burglars.

Statistics show that in [Texas](https://www.fox7austin.com/tag/us/tx)
, Kia is one of the top brands targeted by car burglars, alongside sister brand Hyundai.

Car thefts spiked in 2023 [when a TikTok challenge went viral](https://www.fox7austin.com/news/hyundai-kia-owners-face-threat-of-theft-due-to-social-media-challenge)
, which showed how to steal cars with something as simple as a screwdriver or even the end of a USB cable. The challenge revealed several Kia and Hyundai models built from 2011 to 2021 did not have immobilizers to prevent them from being started without a physical key present.

By the numbers:

Texas DPS provided FOX 7 Austin with the top ten stolen vehicles in the state for Feb. 2025:

*   GM Pickup - 616
*   Ford Pickup - 231
*   Hyundai Elantra - 147
*   GM Tahoe - 132
*   Hyundai Sonata - 115
*   Dodge Pickup - 104
*   Dodge Charger - 92
*   Chevrolet Camaro - 88
*   Kia Optima - 84
*   Honda Accord - 69

In [Austin](https://www.fox7austin.com/tag/us/tx/travis-county/austin)
, statistics show that motor vehicle theft has been on the rise since summer 2018. 

What you can do:

Austin police said they had evidence of the group attempting to steal another Kia Soul, but there was a steering wheel lock on the car and the suspects quickly moved on.

Police say purchasing a steering wheel lock could protect you.

If you see your car being broken into, police say you should call 911, give descriptions of the suspects and a direction of travel when they leave.

"I understand wanting to protect your property, but your vehicle is not worth your life," said Jones.

Jamie White, a 36-year-old writer for Jones’ conspiracy network, Infowars, was fatally shot Monday in an Austin, Texas, parking lot, police said.

At around midnight, Austin Police Department officers located White “lying on the ground in the parking lot with apparent trauma to his body,” [according to a city press release](https://www.austintexas.gov/news/homicide-investigation-2336-douglas-street)

And in an interview with conservative YouTuber Benny Johnson on Tuesday, Jones speculated that the killing “could’ve been a hit” orchestrated by Ukraine.

White’s sister, Kelly Kneale, [told The Independent](https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/crime/jamie-white-infowars-murder-alex-jones-b2712630.html)
 she doesn’t believe there’s a larger conspiracy behind her brother’s killing.

“I don’t believe it was targeted,” she told the publication. Detectives believe the suspects were possibly burglarizing White’s vehicle, when he interrupted them.”

The killing prompted Jones ― best known [for the lies he spread](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/alex-jones-sandy-hook-verdict-connecticut_n_633ddfd6e4b03e8038c52b11)

“To the globalists ... George Soros, you murdered Jamie White. Austin’s [population](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/austincitytexas/LND110210)
 is less than 1 million people.

White, who started working for Infowars around 2021, wrote stories praising President Donald Trump and attacking Democrats.

“EPIC Breaking Video!” reads the headline from one of White’s pieces published last week. “He was shot by a person or persons trying to break into his car for the second time.”

The Austin Police Department is asking for the public’s help in identifying the suspects in White’s killing.

“Anyone with information should contact the Austin Police Department at 512-974-TIPS,” the department said in a statement.

On his program Monday, Jones said White was “an amazing person” and “a good man.”

“Everybody needs to start carrying guns,” Jones added.

 forces in a targeted hit, giving rise to yet another conspiracy theory that officials have cast doubt upon.

Infowars reporter Jamie White, 36, was found lying on the ground in a parking lot outside of his apartment complex with gunshot wounds, according to Austin police. Detectives believe the suspects were possibly burglarizing White's vehicle, when he interrupted them," said the police statement.

Jones, Infowars' founder, said the killing "could've been a hit" while being interviewed by conservative commentator Benny Johnson.

"What are the chances in a town of over two million people that an Infowars lead reporter gets butchered?" Jones inquired, despite Austin having a population of less than one million residents.

He continued to allege that White was on a Ukrainian hit list alongside other prominent figures such as billionaire Tesla CEO Elon Musk, and that he had asked the Justice Department to protect him.

"I think Pam Bondi should look into it," Mr. They said they can't really respond to most crime scenes."

White's social media accounts indicate that he himself believed he was on a Ukrainian hit list.

"I'm on the Ukrainian 'Enemies List' due to my work at Infowars and with Alex Jones on the Ukraine proxy war The group who compiled this list is tied to the U.S. White allegedly confronted suspects attempting to break into his vehicle in the parking lot, upon which they shot him and fled the scene, stated Austin police Detective Jason Jones at a Wednesday press conference.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim that Jamie White was on a Ukrainian hit list is supported by Alex Jones's speculation and a podcast discussion. However, the official reports from Fox 7 Austin ([https://www.fox7austin.com/news/infowars-writer-shooting-austin-police-jamie-white](https://www.fox7austin.com/news/infowars-writer-shooting-austin-police-jamie-white)) and ABC News ([https://abcnews.go.com/US/infowars-reporter-shot-dead-apartment-after-possibly-interrupting/story?id=119677965](https://abcnews.go.com/US/infowars-reporter-shot-dead-apartment-after-possibly-interrupting/story?id=119677965)) do not mention any connection to a Ukrainian hit list.

Therefore, the claim's veracity is uncertain, as it relies on speculative sources. More information is needed to confirm the existence of a Ukrainian hit list and White's alleged inclusion on it.

### Evidence from `web_search`
Fox 7 Austin ([https://www.fox7austin.com/news/infowars-writer-shooting-austin-police-jamie-white](https://www.fox7austin.com/news/infowars-writer-shooting-austin-police-jamie-white)) reports that Jamie White, an InfoWars writer, was shot and killed in Austin, Texas, on March 10. The Austin Police Department announced arrests in connection to the shooting. The suspects were attempting to steal White's car when he was shot. The article does not mention anything about a Ukrainian hit list. <image:9960>, <image:9961>, <image:9962>, <image:9963>, <image:9964>

ABC News ([https://abcnews.go.com/US/infowars-reporter-shot-dead-apartment-after-possibly-interrupting/story?id=119677965](https://abcnews.go.com/US/infowars-reporter-shot-dead-apartment-after-possibly-interrupting/story?id=119677965)) reports that InfoWars reporter Jamie White was shot dead outside his apartment complex in Austin, Texas. The shooting occurred on March 9, 2025. The suspects were breaking into White's Kia when he interrupted them. The article does not mention a Ukrainian hit list. <image:9965>


### Evidence from `web_search`
Jamie White, an Infowars reporter, was shot dead in Austin, Texas, according to articles from Yahoo News ([Source](https://www.yahoo.com/news/alex-jones-blames-globalists-infowars-182655321.html)) and The Latin Times ([Source](https://www.latintimes.com/infowars-reporter-assassinated-ukraine-outside-his-home-conspiracy-theorists-claim-578436)). Alex Jones speculated that Ukraine was responsible for the killing, claiming White was on a Ukrainian hit list. The Investigate Earth Conspiracy Podcast ([Source](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68lCuEsLtFn17oEIQBQGEk)) also discussed the murder and mentioned White may have been on a Ukrainian NGO hit list. <image:782> <image:785> <image:791> <image:792>


## Elaboration
The claim that Jamie White was on a Ukrainian hit list is supported by Alex Jones's speculation and a podcast discussion. However, the official reports from Fox 7 Austin ([https://www.fox7austin.com/news/infowars-writer-shooting-austin-police-jamie-white](https://www.fox7austin.com/news/infowars-writer-shooting-austin-police-jamie-white)) and ABC News ([https://abcnews.go.com/US/infowars-reporter-shot-dead-apartment-after-possibly-interrupting/story?id=119677965](https://abcnews.go.com/US/infowars-reporter-shot-dead-apartment-after-possibly-interrupting/story?id=119677965)) do not mention any connection to a Ukrainian hit list.

Therefore, the claim's veracity is uncertain, as it relies on speculative sources. More information is needed to confirm the existence of a Ukrainian hit list and White's alleged inclusion on it.


# Your Judgement

White’s death was first reported on Monday afternoon when far-right radio host [Alex Jones](/topic/alex-jones)
 announced it on his broadcast, saying that his “best” reporter had been “brutally murdered.” Jones accused Austin's Democratic district attorney and other Democrats across the country of "aiding and abetting" in White's death by failing to control crime, calling them "demons."

 reporter was ‘brutally murdered’ not because of his job but by a suspect who was trying to break into his car, his heartbroken family has revealed.[](/topic/alex-jones)
[](/topic/alex-jones)

Jamie White was killed late Sunday near his Texas apartment in a suspected homicide, his family confirmed.

“I don’t believe it was targeted,” White’s sister Kelly Kneale told _The Independent_. His family says they believe the suspect had tried to break into his car <image:9983>

Infowars journalist Jamie White was reportedly killed outside his Austin home. He was a graduate of Ohio University.

"I come to the Infowars family of viewers and listeners, and to the world, with some really horrible news," Jones said in a post on X.

"There are a lot of really cool people that have worked at Infowars over the years, and one of the most amazing people was Jamie White ... And when they got to the apartment complex, there was yellow tape everywhere and blood all over the parking lot,” Jones recounted.

![Video Player Placeholder](/img/logo-white-out.svg)

Jones praised the police for their quick response, and said _Infowars_ staff had been sent home to grieve.

"I lay all of this squarely at the feet of these DAs and of the Soros crime syndicate, and of the Democratic Party,” Jones said.

Austin District Attorney Garza was elected in 2020 with backing from a Super PAC funded by Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros, who is both a prolific donor to progressive causes and a regular fixation of antisemitic conspiracy theorists.

Since then he has been criticized by Infowars and targeted by conservative mega-billionaire Elon Musk, who [reportedly channeled dark money](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/elon-musk-texas-da-jose-garza-oust-atempt-206db043)
 into an unsuccessful effort to unseat him.

The Austin Police Department said in a [statement Tuesday](https://www.austintexas.gov/news/homicide-investigation-2336-douglas-street)
 that officers responded to the call of a shooting at the Chandelier Apartments located at 2336 Douglas Street.

When police arrived, they found White lying on the ground in the parking lot of the apartment complex where he lived with “obvious signs of trauma” to his body. on Monday, APD said.

“The initial investigation shows that White was shot and killed in the parking lot of the apartment complex in which he lived,” the statement read. Detectives believe the suspects were possibly burglarizing White’s vehicle, when he interrupted them.”

It’s unclear how long White, 36, had worked for InfoWars. Jamie was murdered last night outside of his home, just a few miles away from our studios,” Jones added.

"We sent some people over this morning when he didn't answer the phone, because he was always here early."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Fox 7 Austin ([https://www.fox7austin.com/news/infowars-writer-shooting-austin-police-jamie-white](https://www.fox7austin.com/news/infowars-writer-shooting-austin-police-jamie-white)) reports that Jamie White, an InfoWars writer, was shot and killed in Austin, Texas, on March 10. The Austin Police Department announced arrests in connection to the shooting. The suspects were attempting to steal White's car when he was shot. The article does not mention anything about a Ukrainian hit list. <image:9960>, <image:9961>, <image:9962>, <image:9963>, <image:9964>

ABC News ([https://abcnews.go.com/US/infowars-reporter-shot-dead-apartment-after-possibly-interrupting/story?id=119677965](https://abcnews.go.com/US/infowars-reporter-shot-dead-apartment-after-possibly-interrupting/story?id=119677965)) reports that InfoWars reporter Jamie White was shot dead outside his apartment complex in Austin, Texas. The shooting occurred on March 9, 2025. The suspects were breaking into White's Kia when he interrupted them. The article does not mention a Ukrainian hit list. <image:9965>


### Evidence from `web_search`
Jamie White, an Infowars reporter, was shot dead in Austin, Texas, according to articles from Yahoo News ([Source](https://www.yahoo.com/news/alex-jones-blames-globalists-infowars-182655321.html)) and The Latin Times ([Source](https://www.latintimes.com/infowars-reporter-assassinated-ukraine-outside-his-home-conspiracy-theorists-claim-578436)). Alex Jones speculated that Ukraine was responsible for the killing, claiming White was on a Ukrainian hit list. The Investigate Earth Conspiracy Podcast ([Source](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68lCuEsLtFn17oEIQBQGEk)) also discussed the murder and mentioned White may have been on a Ukrainian NGO hit list. <image:782> <image:785> <image:791> <image:792>


## Elaboration
The claim that Jamie White was on a Ukrainian hit list is supported by Alex Jones's speculation and a podcast discussion. However, the official reports from Fox 7 Austin ([https://www.fox7austin.com/news/infowars-writer-shooting-austin-police-jamie-white](https://www.fox7austin.com/news/infowars-writer-shooting-austin-police-jamie-white)) and ABC News ([https://abcnews.go.com/US/infowars-reporter-shot-dead-apartment-after-possibly-interrupting/story?id=119677965](https://abcnews.go.com/US/infowars-reporter-shot-dead-apartment-after-possibly-interrupting/story?id=119677965)) do not mention any connection to a Ukrainian hit list.

Therefore, the claim's veracity is uncertain, as it relies on speculative sources. More information is needed to confirm the existence of a Ukrainian hit list and White's alleged inclusion on it.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/crime/jamie-white-infowars-murder-alex-jones-b2712630.html): 
Content: The Independent reports that Jamie White's family believes the shooting was not targeted and that the suspects were trying to break into his car. Alex Jones accused Austin's Democratic district attorney and other Democrats of being responsible for White's death. The Austin Police Department stated that White was shot and killed in the parking lot of his apartment complex while possibly interrupting a burglary. The article does not mention any response from the Ukrainian government. <image:9983>


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the claim is not definitively supported. While Alex Jones and a podcast have speculated about a Ukrainian hit list, official reports and the victim's family suggest a different scenario. The Independent article ([https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/crime/jamie-white-infowars-murder-alex-jones-b2712630.html](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/crime/jamie-white-infowars-murder-alex-jones-b2712630.html)) does not mention any response from the Ukrainian government.


## Final Judgement
The claim that Jamie White was on a Ukrainian hit list is not supported by the available evidence. While some sources, such as Alex Jones, have speculated about this, official reports and the victim's family suggest the shooting was related to a car burglary. There is no definitive evidence to confirm the claim.

In the wake of the 12-day war that Israel fought against Iran, the main focus between the two leaders was expected to be how to wind down Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza that began close to two years ago. Accessibility links

![Gaza war looms over Netanyahu White House meeting with Trump](<Base64-Image-Removed>)

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. Netanyahu is slated to meet Tuesday with Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson.

"I think that the discussion with President Trump can certainly help advance that result, which all of us hope for," Netanyahu said.

'It changes from day to day'
----------------------------

White House officials are urging Israel and Hamas to quickly seal a new ceasefire agreement that would bring about a 60-day pause in the fighting, send aid flooding into Gaza and free at least some of the remaining 50 hostages held in the territory, 20 of whom are believed to be living.

Leavitt announced on Monday that Witkoff will travel later this week to Doha, Qatar, for ceasefire and hostage talks.

But a sticking point is whether the ceasefire will end the war altogether. President Donald Trump will meet Monday after their recent joint strikes on Iran.

Israeli Prime Minister [Benjamin Netanyahu](https://abc7.com/tag/Benjamin-Netanyahu)
 and U.S. President [Donald Trump](tag/Donald-Trump)
 might look to take a victory lap on Monday after their recent joint strikes on Iran, hailed by both as an unmitigated success.

But as they meet at the White House for the third time this year, the outwardly triumphant visit will be dogged by Israel's 21-month war against Hamas in Gaza and questions over how hard Trump will push for an end to the conflict.

Trump has made clear that following last month's 12-day war between Israel and Iran he would like to see the Gaza conflict end soon. But that's not always been the case.

As recently as Netanyahu's last visit to Washington in April, the tone was markedly different.

Trump used the photo-op with Netanyahu to announce that the U.S. Associated Press writers Ellen Knickmeyer, Matthew Lee, Lisa Mascaro and Aamer Madhani contributed reporting._

Netanyahu’s Visit to the White House Highlights Critical Foreign Policy Issues
==============================================================================

*   There have been some questions about how Netanyahu will deal with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan as both countries battle for influence in Syria, although Trump suggested that he could serve as a mediator to help the two leaders move beyond their differences.
*   Hamas has been seriously degraded as a military force in Gaza but has not been destroyed, as Netanyahu promised in the opening weeks of Israel’s military campaign.
*   Trump also revealed during the White House meeting that the U.S. <image:5302>

**Bottom Line Up Front**

*   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited U.S. was engaged in “direct talks” with Iran over its nuclear program, although it is unclear whether key obstacles – such as Iranian support for its proxies or its ballistic missile program – will prove insurmountable.

**Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited U.S. Netanyahu is buoyed by his recent meeting with [Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban](https://thesoufancenter.org/intelbrief-2022-april-7/)
, who welcomed Netanyahu and announced that Budapest would be withdrawing from the International Criminal Court (ICC), which has sought indictments for Netanyahu and former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for their role in Israel’s war in Gaza. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth promised would be unrelenting.

During the meeting in the White House, Trump revealed that the United States was engaged in “direct talks” with Iran over its nuclear program, while Iranian Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Aragchi called them “indirect, high-level talks,” which are scheduled to begin on Saturday in Oman. Just recently, former UK ambassador to Iran, Sir Richard Dalton, said that the risk of war with Iran has “never been higher.” Referring to a possible military strike on Iran, if an agreement cannot be reached, Trump said, “So we are going to see if we can avoid it, but it’s getting to very dangerous territory, and hopefully those talks will be successful.”

Content: "It was the enclave's most populous city before the war.

Several world leaders have condemned the plan, and the UN has warned it would lead to "more massive forced displacement" and "more killing".

Hamas warned of "fierce resistance" to the move.

The plan also faces fierce opposition within Israel – including from military officials and hostages' families.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had told Fox News earlier that Israel planned to [occupy the entire Gaza Strip](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4w2q9k4pjo)
 and eventually "hand it over to Arab forces". <image:5340>!Getty Images Palestinians hold out pots and bowls, jostling to reach the front of a line as they await meals distributed by aid groups in Gaza City <image:5341>Getty Images

Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza City have been struggling to access food because of Israel's blockade and ongoing attacks on the Gaza Strip

Israel's security cabinet has approved a plan to take control of Gaza City, in a controversial escalation of its war in Gaza.

Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians live in the city in the north of the Gaza Strip. <image:5343>

Why is just Gaza City being taken over?
---------------------------------------

Before the cabinet meeting Netanyahu said he wanted Israel to control all of Gaza, but in the new plan only Gaza City is mentioned.

Reports in Israeli media suggest there were heated exchanges with the army's chief of staff, who voiced his strong opposition to a full takeover of Gaza.

Israel has said it currently controls 75% of Gaza, while the UN estimates some 86% of the territory is either in militarised zones or under evacuation orders.

The plan aims to have Israeli forces move to take control of the largest city in the enclave, which has already been heavily damaged by Israeli bombing and ground offensives.

It is surrounded by land that has already been under the IDF's control or subject to an evacuation order.

Control over the city is likely to be the first phase of a full scale takeover of the Gaza Strip, our [Middle East correspondent](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/c1mpe9x80xvt)
 Hugo Bachega says.

There has also been some speculation that the threat of full occupation could be part of a strategy to put pressure on Hamas to make concessions in stalled ceasefire negotiations.

Netanyahu told Fox News Israel does "not want to keep" Gaza and intends to hand it over to "Arab forces".

"We want to have a security perimeter. Israeli media reports it was a more limited proposal from the army's chief of staff.

Netanyahu is being "intentionally vague" over which "Arab forces" he believes could run Gaza, according to the BBC's chief international correspondent Lyse Doucet, as he has been in the past with his plans for the territory.

He may be referring to the Jordanians and the Egyptians, who have said they are willing to work with Israel - but they have made it clear that they will not go into Gaza on the back of an Israeli occupation.

No more details have been shared regarding a timeline for Gaza's post-takeover government.

What has the reaction been?
---------------------------

Netanyahu is facing [mounting criticism from hostage families](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c2061vn1mvyo)
 and from world leaders.

UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has called Israel's escalation "wrong" and that it "will only bring more bloodshed".

On Friday Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz said his government will not approve any exports of military equipment to Israel that could be used in Gaza until further notice.

He said it was "increasingly difficult to understand" how the Israeli military plan would help achieve legitimate aims. Historically, Germany has been one of the largest arms suppliers to Israel.

The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas has described the move as a "fully-fledged crime".

Turkey's foreign ministry said Israel aims to "forcibly displace Palestinians from their own land".

The UN's human rights chief Volker Türk says "the war in Gaza must end now" and warns that further escalation "will result in more massive forced displacement, more killing, more unbearable suffering, senseless destruction and atrocity crimes".

The Hostages Families Forum Headquarters said the decision "is leading us toward a colossal catastrophe for both the hostages and our soldiers".

However, the US has been much less critical. On Tuesday, [US President Donald Trump](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn92je014dyo)
 said it was "pretty much up to Israel" whether to fully occupy Gaza, and Washington's Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee said that the plan is not America's concern.

"It's not our job to tell them what they should or should not do," he said.

What we know about Israel's plan to take over Gaza City
=======================================================

8 August 2025

! Much is still very unclear, but here's what we know about the new plan.

What are the details of the plan?
---------------------------------

A statement released by the office of the Israeli prime minister said the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) would "prepare for taking control of Gaza city".

It also outlined what it said were five "principles" for ending the war:

*   The disarmament of Hamas
*   The return of all hostages, both living and dead
*   The demilitarisation of the Gaza Strip
*   Israeli security control over the Gaza Strip
*   The establishment of an alternative civilian administration that is neither Hamas nor the Palestinian Authority

The IDF said the military would prepare to take control of Gaza City while providing humanitarian aid to the "civilian population outside the combat zones".

It is unclear if this is new aid, and if it will be delivered by the controversial Israel and US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation or another mechanism.

Hamas has said the approval of plans to occupy Gaza "constitutes a new war crime".

"We warn the criminal occupation that this criminal adventure will cost it dearly and will not be an easy journey," it said in a statement on Friday.

Netanyahu defends military expansion in Gaza and says it will be wider than announced
=====================================================================================

[World](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world)
 Updated on Aug 10, 2025 6:03 PM EDT — Published on Aug 10, 2025 11:54 AM EDT

JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday defended a new military offensive in Gaza that’s more sweeping than previously announced, declaring in the face of growing condemnation at home and abroad that Israel “has no choice but to finish the job and complete the defeat of Hamas.”

Even as more Israelis express concern over the 22-month war, Netanyahu said the security Cabinet last week instructed the dismantling of Hamas strongholds not only in Gaza City but also in the “central camps” and Muwasi. A source familiar with the operation, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media, confirmed that Israel plans it in both areas.

[**WATCH:** Netanyahu lashes out at critics of plan to occupy Gaza City as condemnation mounts](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/netanyahu-lashes-out-at-critics-of-plan-to-occupy-gaza-city-as-condemnation-mounts)

The camps — sheltering well over a half-million displaced people, according to the U.N. It was not clear why, though Netanyahu faced criticism this weekend within his ruling coalition that targeting Gaza City was not enough. Netanyahu said there would be “safe zones,” but such designated areas have been bombed in the past.

Late Sunday, heavy bombardment was reported in Gaza City. President Donald Trump about the plan and thanked him for his “steadfast support.”

Rejecting starvation in Gaza as well as a “global campaign of lies,” Netanyahu spoke to foreign media just before an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council, a platform for outrage but little action on the war.

“Our goal is not to occupy Gaza, our goal is to free Gaza,” Netanyahu asserted. There was a shortage, and there was certainly no policy of starvation.”

Netanyahu also said he has directed Israel’s military to “bring in more foreign journalists” — which would be a striking development, as they haven’t been allowed into Gaza beyond military embeds during the war.

He again blamed many of Gaza’s problems on the Hamas militant group, including civilian deaths, destruction and aid shortages. “Hamas still has thousands of armed terrorists,” he asserted, adding that Palestinians are “begging” to be freed from them.

Hamas responded with a lengthy statement that summed up Netanyahu’s remarks as “blatant lies.”

U.S. Netanyahu said Chancellor Friedrich Merz of Germany had “buckled under” the growing international criticism by stopping exports of military equipment to Israel that could be used in Gaza. Merz, for his part, told public broadcaster ARD that Germany and Israel were talking “very critically” but Berlin’s overall policies of friendship haven’t changed.

More Palestinians killed as they seek aid
-----------------------------------------

At least 31 Palestinians were killed while seeking aid in Gaza, hospitals and witnesses said. Awda hospital said four people were killed by Israeli gunfire.

Six other aid-seekers were killed while trying to reach GHF sites in Khan Younis and Rafah, Nasser hospital said.

The GHF sites opened in May as an alternative to the U.N.-run aid system, but operations have been marred by deaths and chaos.

Responding to AP inquiries, the GHF media office said: “There were no incidents at or near our sites today.” Israel’s military said there were no incidents involving troops near central Gaza aid sites.

Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich calls on the government to begin annexing parts of the Gaza Strip if Hamas stands by its refusal to lay down its weapons.

The far-right minister, who has vocally opposed striking a deal with Hamas to end the nearly two-year war, presents his plan to “win in Gaza by the end of the year” at a press conference in Jerusalem.

Under Smotrich’s proposal, Hamas would be given an ultimatum to surrender, disarm and release the hostages still held in Gaza since the group’s October 2023 attack that triggered the war.

If Hamas refuses, Smotrich says Israel should annex a section of the territory each week for four weeks, bringing most of the Gaza Strip under full Israeli control.

According to Smotrich, Palestinians would first be told to move south in Gaza, followed by Israel imposing a siege on the territory’s north and center to defeat any remaining Hamas terrorists there, and ending with annexation.

“This can be achieved in three to four months,” he claims, calling on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu “to adopt this plan in full immediately.”

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s defense attorneys in his corruption trial tell the Jerusalem District Court that they will not be able to continue to represent him if the court ramps up proceedings to four times a week, as it has demanded.

The Jerusalem District Court [judges announced](https://www.timesofisrael.com/court-says-netanyahu-to-testify-3-times-per-week-from-november-to-speed-up-trial/)
 earlier this month that four hearings per week will be held starting in November, and Netanyahu will testify in three of them until the end of his cross-examination, “in light of the current need to advance the trial.”

Chief defense attorney Amit Hadad tells the court that the decision will “severely harm” their ability to represent other clients and the “freedom of the defense team to practice,” threatening to resign if it moves ahead with the decision.

Hadad asks the court to schedule a hearing on the matter in the presence of Netanyahu.

Netanyahu’s trial on three charges of corruption has been ongoing since May 2020, with the prime minister’s testimony beginning in November 2024, although many hearings have been delayed and canceled due to his schedule.

The trial is expected to take at least another several years, though multiple unsuccessful efforts have been made to reach a plea deal that would end proceedings.

During yesterday’s [White House meeting](https://www.timesofisrael.com/blair-and-kushner-join-trumps-gaza-meet-official-calls-it-a-simple-policy-session/)
 on the future of Gaza, US President Donald Trump called Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer into the meeting while it was already in progress to set out Israel’s needs for the “day after” Hamas, Channel 12 reports.

Dermer, a top confidante of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, told Trump that Israel does not want to permanently occupy the Gaza Strip or deport Gaza’s residents, according to the report. Israel will continue to ensure that these gains are not eroded and that the security of the residents of the north is safeguarded,” he continues.

The Foreign Ministry adds that ahead of the Security Council discussion on UNIFIL, it “coordinated interagency preparations together with the IDF and the National Security Council,” and held talks with “key international partners,” in efforts it claims led to the decision to end UNIFIL’s mandate.

Israel’s Ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, celebrates the “good news” in a video message, saying UNIFIL “has failed in its mission and allowed Hezbollah to become the region’s most serious threat.”

“The Lebanese government now needs to take responsibility and ensure that no other force is present on its border with Israel,” he adds.

The mandate is set to formally expire in December 2026, with UNIFIL troops scheduled to withdraw from Lebanon during 2027.

While Israel had pushed for the observer force’s mandate to be terminated even sooner, arguing it had not sufficiently acted against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, its ally the US ultimately joined the rest of the Security Council in backing UNIFIL remaining in Lebanon for another year.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office denies as “fake news” a report by the Kan public broadcaster that Israel seriously considered ceding the Mount Dov area in exchange for Syria giving up its claim to the Golan Heights in security talks with Damascus weeks ago.

“The claim that Israel supposedly considered handing over Mount Dov is absolute fake news,” the PMO says in response to the report.

The report concerned the Mount Dov region, an area on the Golan’s border also known as the Shebaa Farms, which is claimed by Israel, Lebanon and Syria.

According to Kan, Israel examined the possibility of transferring the area in return for Damascus suspending its sovereignty claim to the Golan, which Israel captured in the 1967 Six Day War and later annexed. (ANWAR AMRO / AFP)

Khan, who was responsible for pursuing ICC arrest warrants against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Gallant, temporarily stepped aside from his role earlier this year after other allegations emerged of sexual misconduct in the past two years.

His associates have tried to paint the allegations as a pro-Israel smear campaign, although the Guardian says there is “no evidence” of such a plot.

================================================================

This article is more than 5 months old

Meeting between US and Ukraine presidents descends into chaos at White House – here’s what they said, word for word

A meeting between [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump)
 and [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://www.theguardian.com/world/volodymyr-zelenskiy)
 veered sharply off track in front of the television cameras as the US president [berated his Ukrainian counterpart](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/28/trump-zelenskyy-meeting-ukraine-aid-war)
 then abruptly called off a minerals deal with that he had said would be the first step towards a ceasefire with Russia.

Here are the highlights, word-for-word, of the conversation between Trump, Zelenskyy and Vice-President [JD Vance](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jd-vance)
 in the Oval Office.

**Zelenskyy**: What kind of diplomacy, JD, are you are asking about? I will say that.

**Vance**: That’s exactly what you’re doing …

**Trump, raising his voice**: You’re in no position to dictate what we’re going to feel. We’re going to feel very good and very strong.

_Zelenskyy tries to_ _speak._

**Trump**: You right now are not in a very good position. With us, you start having the cards.

You’re gambling with lives of millions of people, you’re gambling with world war three and what you’re doing is very disrespectful to this country.

**Vance**: Have you said thank you once?

**Zelenskyy**: A lot of times.

**Vance**: No, in this meeting, this entire meeting? Offer some words of appreciation for the United States of America and the president who’s trying to save your country.

**Zelenskyy**: Yes, you think that if you will speak very loudly about the war …

**Trump**: He’s not speaking loud. Your country is in big trouble.

**Zelenskyy**: I know, I know.

**Trump**: You’re not winning this. You have a damn good chance of coming out OK, because of us.

**Zelenskyy**: We are staying strong from the very beginning of the war, we have been alone, and we are saying, I said, thanks.

**Trump, speaking over Zelenskyy**: You haven’t been alone … We gave you military equipment. If you didn’t have our military equipment, this war would have been over in two weeks.

**Zelenskyy**: I heard it from Putin in three days.

**Trump**: It’s going to be a very hard thing to do business like this.

**Vance**: Just say thank you.

**Zelenskyy**: I said it a lot of times.

**Vance**: Accept that there are disagreements and let’s go litigate those disagreements rather than trying to fight it in the American media, when you’re wrong. What do you mean?

**Vance**: I’m talking about the kind of diplomacy that’s going to end the destruction of your country.

**Zelenskyy**: Yes, but if you …

**Vance**: Mr President, with respect, I think it’s disrespectful for you to come to the Oval Office and try to litigate this in front of the American media."

The scandal came to light when a [whistleblower](/wiki/Whistleblower "Whistleblower")
 report revealed that President Trump had asked Ukrainian president [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy "Volodymyr Zelenskyy")
 in July 2019 to investigate [Joe Biden](/wiki/Joe_Biden "Joe Biden")
, Trump's political opponent in the [2020 presidential election](/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election "2020 United States presidential election")
, his son [Hunter Biden](/wiki/Hunter_Biden "Hunter Biden")

 and Attorney General [William Barr](/wiki/William_Barr "William Barr")

 Trump acknowledged he had told Zelenskyy "we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son \[contributing\] to the corruption already in the Ukraine."[\[25\]](#cite_note-trump_acknowledges-25)
 According to the whistleblower, the call was part of a wider campaign by Trump, his administration, and Giuliani to pressure Ukraine into investigating the Bidens, which may have included Trump's cancelling a scheduled trip to Ukraine by Vice President [Mike Pence](/wiki/Mike_Pence "Mike Pence")
, and Trump withholding $400 million in military aid from Ukraine.[\[26\]](#cite_note-Balsamo-190926-26)

Immediately after the Trump–Zelenskyy call ended, White House national security aides discussed their deep concerns, with at least one [National Security Council](/wiki/United_States_National_Security_Council "United States National Security Council")

[\[30\]](#cite_note-raised_alarms-30)
 A text message between a State Department envoy to Ukraine and a Ukrainian official showed the envoy understood from the White House that a Zelenskyy visit with Trump was contingent upon Ukraine's investigating [a conspiracy theory about alleged Ukrainian meddling](/wiki/Conspiracy_theories_related_to_the_Trump%E2%80%93Ukraine_scandal "Conspiracy theories related to the Trump–Ukraine scandal")
 in the [2016 U.S. On May 7, Zelenskyy and a group of his advisors had a three-hour meeting to discuss how to respond to Trump and Giuliani's pressure and how to avoid becoming involved in domestic American politics.[\[90\]](#cite_note-pressure-90)
 Giuliani said the investigations he sought would be beneficial to President Trump, his client, and that his efforts had Trump's full support.[\[91\]](#cite_note-plans_trip-91)
 Giuliani's efforts began as an attempt to provide cover for Trump to pardon Manafort, who had been [convicted of eight felony counts](/wiki/Trials_of_Paul_Manafort "Trials of Paul Manafort")
 in August 2018.[\[92\]](#cite_note-92)

On May 10, Giuliani canceled a scheduled trip to Ukraine where he had intended to urge president-elect Zelenskyy to pursue inquiries into Hunter Biden, as well as whether Democrats colluded with Ukrainians to release information about Manafort.[\[93\]](#cite_note-93)
[\[94\]](#cite_note-WaPo_How_Trump_pressured-94)
 Giuliani claimed he has sworn statements from five Ukrainians stating they were brought into the Obama White House in January 2016 and told to "go dig up dirt on Trump and Manafort", although he has not produced evidence for the claim.[\[95\]](#cite_note-CNBC-eight-times-95)
 Giuliani asserted he cancelled the trip because he had been "set up" by Ukrainians who objected to his efforts, and blamed Democrats for trying to "spin" the trip. On this call, Giuliani said that if Zelenskyy were to publicly announce an investigation into Biden, it would help Zelenskyy have "a much better relationship" with Trump.[\[98\]](#cite_note-new_audio-98)

The Trump administration is pausing military aid to Ukraine, a White House official said, just days after a [disastrous meeting](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5312076/zelenskyys-visit-to-the-white-house-ends-abruptly-after-oval-office-spat)
 between President Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

 "The President has been clear that he is focused on peace. "We are pausing and reviewing our aid to ensure that it is contributing to a solution."

The move comes a day before [Trump is scheduled to speak to Congress](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/03/nx-s1-5313468/trump-joint-session-of-congress)
, and as Europe is working to [forge a coalition](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/02/g-s1-51585/uk-france-ukraine-ceasefire-plan)
 to support Ukraine in its war against Russia.

Monday night's development is the latest twist in a saga that began last Friday when Zelenskyy visited the White House to finalize a deal on minerals, which Trump has said is a step toward a broader peace deal he is trying to broker. Trump has been reluctant to commit to that.

In London Sunday, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Zelenskyy had agreed to work on a [ceasefire plan](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/02/g-s1-51585/uk-france-ukraine-ceasefire-plan)
 with Britain and France. But the meeting between the two men deteriorated when they began openly arguing about how to end Russia's war in Ukraine.

Trump accused Zelenskyy of "gambling with World War III" and "disrespecting" the United States.

Ukraine has been pushing for security guarantees from the United States to prevent Russia from seizing more territory if there is indeed a ceasefire.

CNN  — 

President Donald Trump is ordering a pause on shipments of US military aid to Ukraine after his heated [Oval Office argument](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/01/politics/inside-trump-zelensky-meeting/index.html)
 with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last week, a White House official told CNN Monday.

The halt in aid, which came after Trump held a [series of meetings](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/03/politics/trump-zelensky-national-security-meetings/index.html)
 with top national security officials at the White House, could have dire effect on Ukraine’s war-fighting abilities, officials and analysts said. It will remain in place until Trump determines Zelensky has made a commitment to seeking peace talks, one official said, essentially forcing Ukraine to a negotiating table by threatening further losses on the battlefield.

“The president has been clear that he is focused on peace. We are pausing and reviewing our aid to ensure that it is contributing to a solution,” the White House official said.

After more than a week of open hostility between Washington and Kyiv, Monday’s pause was the most material sign of how far the relationship has deteriorated since Trump took office.

In recent weeks, Trump has echoed Russian President Vladimir Putin’s talking points, falsely claiming Ukraine started the war and accusing Zelensky of being a dictator, but his decision to halt the delivery of military aid is a move that could have real consequences for the balance of the conflict and strengthen Putin’s hand.

The pause will apply to all military equipment not yet inside Ukraine, officials said, and amounts to a direct response to what Trump views as Zelensky’s bad behavior last week.

Ukraine could likely sustain its current fighting pace for several weeks — perhaps until the start of the summer — before a US pause would begin to have a major effect, Western officials said in the wake of the decision. “Their front lines would continue to buckle and eventually they would break and Ukraine would have to accept an adverse – even catastrophic – peace settlement.”

But Cancian warned the Trump administration has more forms of aid to Ukraine that can be paused or canceled altogether, including intelligence sharing and the training of Ukrainian forces.

The White House made the decision to pause military aid to Ukraine for now as officials seek an acknowledgement from Zelensky about [the breakdown in relations](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/03/politics/trump-zelensky-national-security-meetings/index.html)
 following Friday’s blowup in the Oval Office.

According to several officials, Trump and his senior aides are seeking an acknowledgement from Zelensky – potentially in the form of a public apology – before moving ahead with a [deal on Ukraine’s rare earth minerals](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/26/europe/ukraine-us-mineral-resources-deal-explained-intl-latam/index.html)
, which had been close to agreement before Friday’s meeting, or a discussion on continuing foreign aid. The decision to halt the aid was made later on Monday, one person said, and is part of a pressure strategy on Ukraine.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio publicly called for Zelensky to apologize for Friday [in an interview on CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/28/politics/rubio-zelensky-apology-trump-cnntv/index.html)
.

The halt puts Trump even more clearly at odds with the United States’ traditional [European allies](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/02/europe/ukraine-russia-zelensky-starmer-summit-intl/index.html)
 like Britain and France, who made clear their support for Zelensky at a summit in London on Sunday.

“There is a capability gap that Europe cannot fill alone,” one US official said.

A European official called the Trump administration’s decision to pause military aid to Ukraine “petty and wrong.”

The official said it will immediately deepen distrust in the US government among the Ukrainian people. The official also predicted it will cause unnecessary civilian casualties, as Ukraine will not be able to defend against Russian air attacks after they run out of air defense missiles.

“I’m beyond disappointed,” the official told CNN

Since the start of the war, the Biden administration announced 74 separate packages of military aid pulled directly from US inventories, allowing the critical munitions and supplies to flow quickly to Ukraine. Markwayne Mullin, a Trump ally, said he thought the US obligation to Ukraine only goes “so far,” saying, “the American taxpayers are tired of funding this war, and there’s no end in sight.”

“I don’t believe that any of us sitting here believes that Ukraine can win this war, and the president is saying, ‘Let’s bring an end to it,’” the Oklahoma Republican continued, adding that if Zelensky wants the US to continue negotiating peace, “then we will.”

However, he warned if Zelensky “doesn’t want to negotiate peace, then it’s not our job to make the taxpayers continue to fund an endless war.”

GOP Sen. Brian Mast told CNN he “knew it was an option” for the Trump administration to pause all US military aid to Ukraine.

“I think people can assume that everything is on the table with Ukraine right now,” he said.

Russia repeatedly stated that arms supplies to Ukraine hinder the settlement and directly involve NATO countries in the conflict. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that the United States and NATO were directly involved in the conflict not only by providing weapons but also by training Ukrainian personnel in European countries.

MOSCOW (Sputnik) - Ukraine has lost around 40 Leopard tanks since the beginning of Russia's special military operation in February 2022, the Business Insider news outlet reported on Thursday.

Some open-source estimates suggest that Ukraine had already [lost](https://en.sputniknews.africa/20241013/1068665538.html)
 nearly 40 Leopards, but those estimates are unconfirmed so far, according to the report.

Russia repeatedly stated that arms supplies to Ukraine hinder the settlement and directly involve NATO countries in the conflict. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that the United States and [NATO](https://en.sputniknews.africa/20240512/1066501213.html)
 were directly involved in the conflict not only by providing weapons but also by training Ukrainian personnel in European countries.

Ukrainian Armed Forces destroyed in the Zaporozhye direction. Russian Defence Ministry / TASS

Moscow said Tuesday that it had captured several German Leopard tanks and U.S. Bradley infantry fighting vehicles, releasing footage showing Russian troops surveying the equipment supplied to Ukraine by Western countries.

"Leopard tanks and Bradley infantry fighting vehicles. These are our trophies. Equipment of the Ukrainian armed forces in the Zaporizhzhia region," the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement.

"Servicemen of the Vostok group inspect enemy tanks and infantry fighting vehicles captured in battle."

Kyiv has appealed to its allies in the West to deliver a broad range of modern military equipment to help Ukrainian forces recapture large swathes of territory controlled by Russian forces.

The Defense Ministry said several of the captured vehicles had working engines, suggesting that the battles they were involved in had been short and that Ukrainian troops had "fled" their offensive positions.

**(DEFENCE SECURITY ASIA) — During the week of May 11 to 17, Russian military claimed to have successfully destroyed five Leopard 2A1 tanks, manufactured by the German company Krauss-Maffei but donated to the Ukrainian Armed Forces to help the Eastern Europe country in its armed conflict with Russia.**

**In addition to the Leopard tanks, the Russian Ministry of Defense also alleged that 13 armored vehicles, 55 various vehicles, “Grad” multiple rocket launcher systems, and 47 artillery units—22 of which were supplied by foreign countries—were destroyed during this period.**

**Moreover, four Mi-24 helicopters and 40 unmanned boats belonging to the Ukrainian military were reportedly destroyed by Russia in the same timeframe.**

**Among the foreign-supplied armored vehicles to Ukraine, the Leopard tanks have been the most frequently supplied to Kyiv compared to other models such as the American-made Abrams and the British-made Challengers.**

**Since last year, countries such as Germany and several other European nations have supplied between 100-200 Leopard tanks to Ukraine for use in a spring counteroffensive against Russian positions.**

**“Russian Soldiers Pose in Front of Captured Leopard 2A6 Tank”**

**Line of Leopard tanks and Bradley armoured infantry fighting vehicle were destroyed in Zaphorizia, southern Ukraine.**

**Although the Ukrainian counteroffensive in 2023 initially started well, it faced increasingly formidable opposition from Russian forces who began altering their tactics and strategies.**

**These changes in strategy and tactics by the Russian forces led to the destruction of many of the Ukrainian tanks that had been supplied by donor countries like Germany, other European nations, the United States, and Britain.**

**However, to date, no one knows exactly how many Leopard tanks have been destroyed by Russia.**

**Nevertheless, Russian President Vladimir Putin has reportedly stated to his country’s war correspondents that Ukraine has lost more than 160 tanks supplied by foreign countries.**

**Given the high volume of Leopard tanks supplied to Ukraine, it is logical to conclude that many of the tanks destroyed by Russia were Leopard models.**

**Regarding the Abrams tanks, the Russian military stated that of the 31 American-made tanks supplied to Ukraine, more than five of the tanks have been destroyed by Russian forces.**

**A charred M1A1 Abrams main battle tank being transported to Moscow to participate in an exhibition at Victory Park.**

 **As a result of the destruction of five Abrams tanks, the United States has reportedly “withdrawn” these tanks from the Ukrainian battlefield, likely in an effort to “preserve its reputation.”**

**Following the destruction experienced by Leopard tanks supplied by Germany and other European countries, Ukraine’s Deputy Foreign Minister Andii Melnyk has requested that Kiev be supplied with more Leopard tanks, including the latest variant, the Leopard 2A6.**

 **However, the newest Leopard 2A6 variant supplied to Ukraine has met the same fate.**

**The Russian military reported capturing the most powerful tank in the Ukrainian arsenal, the German-made Leopard 2A6, after intense fighting in Avdiivka, Ukraine, last April.**

**It is believed that Ukraine possesses 21 Leopard 2A6 tanks, with 18 of these tanks developed by the companies Krauss-Maffei Wegmann and Rheinmetall being donated by Germany, while the remainder were provided by Portugal.**

**However, most of these Leopard 2A6 tanks donated to the Ukrainian military could not be used after failing to be properly maintained and remained inoperable as claimed by a senior German politician last January.**

**An Abrams tank caught fire after being struck by a Lancet kamikaze drone and an RPG from Russian forces.**

**According to Russian military sources, after capturing and removing the tank from the combat area, Russian forces transported the tank and sent it to Moscow, possibly for research purposes.**

**The Leopard 2A6 was successfully captured after a Russian platoon executed an ambush that caused the Ukrainian tank crew to abandon the German-made vehicle.**

**The Leopard 2A6 represents an upgrade from the Leopard 2A5, incorporating enhanced armor protection, firepower, and electronic warfare capabilities.**

**The tank measures 9.97 meters in length and weighs 62.3 tons, making it one of the heaviest main battle tanks ever deployed, with an engine power of 1,500 horsepower.**

**Capable of speeds up to 75 km/h and with an operational range of 500 km, it is equipped with a Rheinmetall 120 mm L/55 cannon, allowing it to fire all standard NATO ammunition types, including APFSDS, HEAT, and multi-purpose shells.**

**The Leopard 2A6 also features dual 7.62 mm MG3A1 machine guns and an advanced fire control system including a laser rangefinder, thermal imaging, and a ballistic computer. — DSA**

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Sunday that his forces had advanced up to 3 kilometres (1.86 miles) in Russia's Kursk region, taking control of two more settlements there.

Russia said it had struck Ukraine's 22nd and 115th Mechanized Brigades, the 82nd Airborne Assault Brigade, and a Guard and Support Brigade in at least 12 different places with air strikes, artillery and infantry.

Moscow said it had also repelled attacks at seven additional places in Kursk and had struck Ukrainian forces at 16 other locations in Ukraine's neighbouring Sumy region.

"Units of the northern group of forces, with the support of army aviation and artillery fire, repelled attacks by enemy assault groups in the direction of the settlements of Kremyanoye, Malaya Loknya and Nechayev," Russia's defence ministry said in a statement.

It said Russian forces had also "thwarted attempts to attack in the direction of Komarovka, Spalnoye, Korenevo, Pogrebky and Olgovka."

The ministry said it was seeking to identify and destroy Ukrainian sabotage units which had hidden in the forests in an attempt to penetrate deeper into Russian sovereign territory.

While the Kursk incursion has grabbed headlines, Russian officials say the attack will fail to draw Russian forces away from the east of Ukraine where they are still advancing. Reuters was unable to verify battlefield reports from either side.

Russia also gave estimates for Ukrainian losses in Kursk, but Reuters does not publish combatant estimates from either side.

No effect on the Pokrovsk front
-------------------------------

There was also increasing evidence that Moscow was having trouble stopping the Ukrainian counterinvasion in Kursk and was increasingly tapping elite units to do so.

Russian military reporters and geolocated footage have revealed that elements of the 810th and 155th naval infantry brigades, the 11th Airborne Brigade, and the 51st and 56th airborne regiments were redeployed to fight in Kursk.

The 810th and 155th naval infantry brigades had been fighting in Kharkiv, where Russia launched a new incursion in May. Sarantsev admitted that the Kursk action had had no effect on the Pokrovsk front.

Western analysts have offered differing explanations for the Kursk offensive – including the diversion of Russian troops and a psychological reset through seizing the initiative. ![](/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AP24240624343613-1724950393.jpg?resize=770%2C513&quality=80)

Ukraine’s deep strikes against Russian military targets and its three-week-old ground offensive inside Russian territory have appeared to be yielding military and political results during the past week.

Russia was reported to be moving its aircraft back from airfields near the Ukrainian border while glide bomb attacks inside Ukraine were reported to have decreased. Life has the same value everywhere.”

Zelenskyy said he had discussed such a joint aerial defence with Lithuanian Prime Minister Ingrid Shimonite and Polish President Andrej Duda in Kyiv on August 24.

Taking the fight to Russia
--------------------------

While Ukraine seeks expanded authority and cooperation from its allies, it is also going its own way. It is believed prototypes of this missile may have been used against Russian-occupied Crimea in August 2023 to [destroy two S-400](/news/2024/2/12/for-ukraines-defence-industry-ambitions-the-skys-the-limit)
 air defence systems. Evidence that Moscow was scrambling elite units from Ukraine to defend home turf also mounted during the week.

An unnamed White House official told the Politico news website that “90 percent of the planes that launch glide bombs” against Ukrainian front-line positions had been moved back inside Russia.

![INTERACTIVE-ATTACK_ON_KURSK_AUG_28-1724833592](/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/INTERACTIVE-ATTACK_ON_KURSK_AUG_20-1724833592.png?w=770&resize=770%2C962&quality=80)

(Al Jazeera)

The independent analysis website Frontelligence agreed that “between the second half of June and mid-July, Russian forces relocated many valuable assets away from the Ukrainian border,” including planes and helicopters.

Ukrainian Colonel Vitaly Sarantsev told a joint news telethon broadcast by Ukrainian channels that the Kursk offensive had greatly reduced Russia’s use of aviation against northeastern Ukraine.

“We felt relief in tactical aviation,” he said on Sunday. If so, that would be a significant proportion of the more than 700,000 soldiers Russia is estimated to have in Ukraine.

The Washington, DC-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a think tank, estimated that Russia would need 60,000 soldiers to win back territory in Kursk once Ukrainian defences were dug. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy last week said it was a preemptive defence to prevent another Kharkiv-type invasion in the north.

But he also told Ukrainians it was “a way to compensate for the deficit in long-range capabilities”.

For months, Zelenskyy has implored the United States to allow Ukraine to use the [ATACMS long-range rocket artillery](/news/2024/8/23/which-countries-weapons-is-ukraine-using-in-russia-incursion)
 it provides to strike airfields deep inside Russia. He also wants the US to release Britain and France, for whose Storm Shadow missiles the US provides components, to authorise their use in the same way.

Currently, the US allows Ukraine to use its weapons to counter battery fire within a limited range across the border but not to hit Russian airfields because it is afraid that this could draw the US into the war.

![INTERACTIVE-WHO CONTROLS WHAT IN SOUTHERN UKRAINE-1724833604](/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/INTERACTIVE-WHO-CONTROLS-WHAT-IN-SOUTHERN-UKRAINE-1724833604.png?w=770&resize=770%2C770&quality=80)

(Al Jazeera)

In a recent analysis, the ISW identified that “at least 209 of 245 (more than 85 percent) known Russian military objects in range of ATACMS are not air bases” but ammunition depots, communications centres, army bases and command centres.

White House national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters on Monday that restrictions on the use of long-range weapons remain in place but “we’ll keep the conversations with the Ukrainians going” to potentially revise them.

The European Commission, which does not command military assets, has openly supported a lifting of restrictions.

The European Union’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, [repeated that support](/news/2024/8/29/eus-borrell-urges-ukraine-backers-to-lift-curbs-on-arms-use-inside-russia)
 on Monday and Thursday. “I reiterate that lifting restrictions on the use of capabilities against the Russian military involved in aggression against Ukraine, in accordance with international law, would strengthen Ukrainian self-defence, save lives and reduce destruction in Ukraine,” he said on Monday.

Russian officials bared their teeth against any such decision and hit out against the fact that both Brussels and Washington have allowed the use of US and European equipment in Ukraine’s Kursk offensive.

“The West does not want to avoid escalation."

The article mentions that Russia was moving its aircraft back from airfields near the Ukrainian border. The article also mentions that the Kursk offensive had greatly reduced Russia’s use of aviation against northeastern Ukraine.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Ukraine launched an incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024, and that there were tank losses on the Ukrainian side. The Reuters article states that Russia claimed Ukraine lost 73 tanks in the Kursk region. The reverse image search shows that the image of destroyed tanks appears in multiple sources. However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that the image depicts destroyed Ukrainian tanks during the Kursk incursion.

To verify the claim, additional information is needed to confirm that the image specifically depicts the events of the Kursk incursion and that the destroyed tanks are Ukrainian.

From [Source](https://nationalsecurityjournal.org/russia-suffered-80000-casualties-in-the-battle-for-kursk/): 
Content: "Oleksandr Syrskyi, has revealed a staggering new figure, claiming Russia suffered 80,000 casualties during Ukraine’s 2024 incursion into the Kursk region.

\-The operation, initially a “masterstroke,” caught Russia by surprise and exposed the “deplorable state” of its border defenses.

\-It successfully forced Moscow to divert troops from other fronts, derailing a planned Russian offensive in Sumy.

\-However, the incursion eventually turned into a bloody “slugfest,” and while Russia’s losses were immense, critics note the operation also cost Ukraine dearly and did not halt Russian advances elsewhere.

**Moscow Suffered 80,000 Casualties in the Kursk Incursion by Ukraine**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

WARSAW, POLAND – Ukraine’s August 2024 incursion into the Kursk region was regarded as a masterstroke at the time.

Not only was the [Russian military](https://nationalsecurityjournal.org/russias-great-su-35-fighter-nightmare-its-top-fighter-keeps-getting-shot-down/)
 caught entirely by surprise, but the ability of the Ukrainian units to [occupy a sizeable piece of territory](https://understandingwar.org/backgrounder/ukraine%E2%80%99s-kursk-incursion-six-month-assessment)
 on the Russian side of the border caused President Vladimir [Putin](https://nationalsecurityjournal.org/us-to-china-stop-fueling-putins-war-in-ukraine-or-else/)
 considerable embarrassment.

More significantly, perhaps, was the degree to which this small invasion into Kursk revealed the disorganized and generally deplorable state of the Russian military on that part of the front.

As the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) assessment of the operation points out, one of the chief weaknesses that Ukraine exploited was that the Kremlin had “[failed to prioritize security along the international border](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-october-12)
 with northern Ukraine throughout the invasion” and that the Kursk Oblast was neglected “in favor of fortifying and reinforcing Russian positions in eastern and southern Ukraine.”

Rather than having a proper organization or command structure of regular armed forces units, the Kremlin had “largely relied on Federal Security Service (FSB) border guards, Rosgvardia units, territorial defense units, and poorly trained conscripts to defend the border over the last three years.”

**80,000 Casualties** 
----------------------

Today’s news makes the picture look even worse with Ukrainian Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi revealing in a 23 July [interview in the Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/07/23/ukraine-syrsky-interview-war-trump/)
 that Moscow has suffered 80,000 soldiers killed and injured during this cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast.

**Kursk Operation Kept Russians From Attacking in Sumy**
--------------------------------------------------------

Syrskyi [has not revealed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/07/23/ukraine-syrsky-interview-war-trump/)
 Ukraine’s casualties in [Kursk Oblast](https://kyivindependent.com/tag/kursk-oblast/)
 as Kyiv does not release those numbers, but he did day said that Russia’s losses were orders of magnitude greater.  The US Washington, DC daily qualified the comments by stating these claims could not be independently verified.

Ukraine launched the Kursk incursion across the Russian border into Kursk in August of last year.  The operation not only met with largely ineffective resistance at first, but at its highwater mark Kyiv’s forces had taken roughly 500 square miles of territory within just a few months.

The entire operation was orchestrated by Syrskyi and was aimed at forcing Moscow’s military to siphon off Russian units from the front lines in Ukraine’s eastern region, so that they could mount a counterattack and drive the Ukrainian troops out of the salient created.

This, in turn, reduced the resources available for offensive operations to the degree that Moscow’s plans to invade Ukraine’s [Sumy Oblast](https://nationalsecurityjournal.org/ukraine-war-update-no-one-know-who-is-winning-in-sumy/)
, a northeastern region bordering Kursk Oblast, had to be shelved.

In the Spring of this year, Russia finally mounted a counteroffensive against the Ukrainian forces.  Their numbers were supplemented by some 12,000 [North Korean troops](https://nationalsecurityjournal.org/6000-casualties-later-north-korea-prepares-to-send-more-troops-to-russia/)
, who the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) leader, [Kim Jong-un](https://nationalsecurityjournal.org/north-korea-will-now-unconditionally-support-russias-brutal-war-against-ukraine/)
, is receiving US$2000 per soldier per month from Putin.

**How Much of a Masterstroke Was the Kursk Operation?**
-------------------------------------------------------

The Russian counter-offensive this spring eventually pushed the Ukrainian units from much of the Kursk region. Their argument also suggests that the Kursk operation should have been curtailed much sooner, so that it would not have turned into the “slugfest” that resulted in substantial losses on the Ukrainian side, both in personnel and equipment.

To this day, Syrskyi and other Ukrainian political and military officials refer to these heavy Russian casualties as the Kursk operation’s most important accomplishment.

In April, after Russia claimed to have taken back most of the territory in the Kursk Oblast, the [Ukrainian military](https://kyivindependent.com/russia-lost-over-62-400-soldiers-in-kursk-operation-ukraine-says/)
 estimated Russian losses at 25,200 killed and 36,200 injured.

Added to that total are another [6,000 DPRK soldiers lost](https://kyivindependent.com/north-korean-losses-exceed-half-of-total-troops-deployed-to-russias-kursk-oblast-uk-intelligence-reports/)
, which is half of their force that was sent to the region originally.

Neither side has the initiative nor the capacity to effect any meaningful change in the disposition of the front lines.

Until then, the war is likely to continue as it is now, and with very little chance of it ending anytime [soon](https://nationalsecurityjournal.org/russias-war-in-ukraine-summed-up-in-2-words/)
.

Reports from the open-source monitoring group [DeepState](https://deepstatemap.live/en#6/49.4383200/32.0526800)
, that maintains a live, interactive map on-line, show that Ukrainian units continue to occupy a small section of Russian territory on the border in Kursk Oblast.  Kyiv has also regularly denounced Moscow’s claims that hostilities in the area have ended.

The Kursk operation was initially lauded for achieving complete operational surprise and rapidly occupying a sizable piece of Russian territory.

From a psychological standpoint the operation was a success on several levels.

 from the Hoover Institution, written by former US Ambassador to Russia Michael Mc Faul points out that:

What now for Ukraine's offensive?
---------------------------------

Ukraine's top general, Oleksandr Syrskyi, insists that Ukrainian forces have pulled back to "more favourable positions", remain in Kursk, and would do so "for as long as it is expedient and necessary".

He said Russia had suffered more than 50,000 losses during the operation - including those killed, injured or captured.

However, the situation now is very different to last August. <image:10170>!Map showing the region of Sudzha in August 2024, controlled by Ukraine and on 16 March 2025, under Russian control <image:10173>

At the time of writing, just before Russia retook Sudzha, Volodymyr said Ukrainian forces were being pressed from three sides.

Maksym: Vehicle wrecks litter the roads
---------------------------------------

By 11 March, Ukrainian forces were battling to prevent the road being cut, according to Telegram messages from "Maksym".

"A few days ago, we received an order to leave the defence lines in an organised retreat," he said, adding that Russia had amassed a significant force to retake the town, "including large numbers of North Korean soldiers".

Military experts estimate Russia had amassed a force of up to 70,000 troops to retake Kursk – including about 12,000 North Koreans.

Russia had also sent its best drone units to the front and was using kamikaze and first-person-view (FPV) variants to "take fire control of the main logistics routes".

They included drones linked to operators by fibre-optic wires - which are impossible to jam with electronic counter-measures.

Maksym said as a result "the enemy managed to destroy dozens of units of equipment", and that wrecks had "created congestion on supply routes".

Ukrainian forces travel towards the Kursk region on a supply route in Sumy last August. Drones are in the sky all the time."

The soldier predicted Ukraine's entire foothold in Kursk would be lost but that "from a military point of view, the Kursk direction has exhausted itself. There is no point in keeping it any more".

Western officials estimate that Ukraine's Kursk offensive involved about 12,000 troops. On 13 March, Russia said the situation in Kursk was "fully under our control" and that Ukraine had "abandoned" much of its material.

BBC Verify: What does Putin video tell us about the battle for Kursk?

Dmytro: Inches from death
-------------------------

In social media posts on 11-12 March, a fourth soldier, "Dmytro" likened the retreat from the front to "a scene from a horror movie".

"The roads are littered with hundreds of destroyed cars, armoured vehicles and ATVs (All Terrain Vehicles). Military analysts estimate two-thirds of the 1,000 sq km gained at the outset have since been lost.

Any hopes that Ukraine would be able to trade Kursk territory for some of its own have significantly diminished.

Last week, President Volodymyr Zelensky said he believed the Kursk operation had "accomplished its task" by forcing Russia to pull troops from the east and relieve pressure on Pokrovsk.

But it is not yet clear at what cost.

Another source, The Moscow Times, published on June 13, 2023, states that Russia captured German Leopard tanks in the Zaporizhzhia region.

A third source, Defence Security Asia, published on May 19, 2024, discusses the destruction of German-made Leopard tanks in Ukraine and mentions that the Russian military claimed to have destroyed five Leopard 2A1 tanks between May 11 and 17, 2024. None of the sources mention Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024.


### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results discuss the 2024 Kursk offensive, which began on August 6, 2024, as part of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The Armed Forces of Ukraine launched an incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast. The article mentions the involvement of Ukrainian brigades, Russian forces, and North Korean forces. The article also mentions the number of casualties and equipment losses. The article includes a timeline of the campaign and mentions the capture of settlements and the destruction of bridges. The article also mentions the involvement of the 80th and 82nd Air Assault Brigades. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kursk_campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kursk_campaign))

Reuters reports on August 26, 2024, that Russia said Ukraine had lost 73 tanks, 61 armored personnel carriers and 404 armored combat vehicles in the Kursk region. The article also mentions an incursion by Ukraine into the Kursk region. ([https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-says-it-pummelled-ukrainian-forces-along-kursk-front-2024-08-26/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-says-it-pummelled-ukrainian-forces-along-kursk-front-2024-08-26/)) The Al Jazeera article, published on August 29, 2024, discusses Ukraine's ground offensive inside Russian territory, specifically in the Kursk region. <image:k> shows a building on fire in Sudzha, Russia, after a cross-border incursion of Ukrainian troops into the Kursk region on August 7, 2024. The article mentions that Russia was moving its aircraft back from airfields near the Ukrainian border. The article also mentions that the Kursk offensive had greatly reduced Russia’s use of aviation against northeastern Ukraine.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Ukraine launched an incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024, and that there were tank losses on the Ukrainian side. The Reuters article states that Russia claimed Ukraine lost 73 tanks in the Kursk region. The reverse image search shows that the image of destroyed tanks appears in multiple sources. However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that the image depicts destroyed Ukrainian tanks during the Kursk incursion.

To verify the claim, additional information is needed to confirm that the image specifically depicts the events of the Kursk incursion and that the destroyed tanks are Ukrainian.

One source, from Sputnik Africa, published on October 17, 2024, reports that Ukraine has lost around 40 Leopard tanks since February 2022. Another source, The Moscow Times, published on June 13, 2023, states that Russia captured German Leopard tanks in the Zaporizhzhia region.

A third source, Defence Security Asia, published on May 19, 2024, discusses the destruction of German-made Leopard tanks in Ukraine and mentions that the Russian military claimed to have destroyed five Leopard 2A1 tanks between May 11 and 17, 2024. None of the sources mention Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024.


### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results discuss the 2024 Kursk offensive, which began on August 6, 2024, as part of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The Armed Forces of Ukraine launched an incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast. The article mentions the involvement of Ukrainian brigades, Russian forces, and North Korean forces. The article also mentions the number of casualties and equipment losses. The article includes a timeline of the campaign and mentions the capture of settlements and the destruction of bridges. The article also mentions the involvement of the 80th and 82nd Air Assault Brigades. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kursk_campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kursk_campaign))

Reuters reports on August 26, 2024, that Russia said Ukraine had lost 73 tanks, 61 armored personnel carriers and 404 armored combat vehicles in the Kursk region. The article also mentions an incursion by Ukraine into the Kursk region.

One-way attack drones and other Ukrainian weapons have destroyed thousands of Russian tanks in the past year as well as thousands of other platforms, according to the commander of U.S. Thousands of tanks destroyed on both sides,” Cavoli said.

At the start of the full-scale war in February 2022, Russia had about 13,000 tanks on active status and in storage, according to Cavoli.

“They’re starting to approach near the end of … the useful tanks in storage. Fundamental change in the way where we’re doing business,” he said.

[! So, depending on how much more they lose, that will really determine how quickly they can regenerate,” he told lawmakers.

“Russian ground forces in Ukraine have lost an estimated 3,000 tanks, 9,000 armored vehicles, 13,000 artillery systems, and over 400 air defense systems in the past year,” Cavoli said in a written statement to the committee.

However, Moscow is on pace to replace those losses, he added, noting that it has expanded its industrial production, opened new manufacturing facilities, and converted commercial production lines for military purposes.

“As a result, the Russian defense industrial base is expected to roll out 1,500 tanks, 3,000 armored vehicles, and 200 Iskander ballistic and cruise missiles this year. (Comparatively, the United States only produces about 135 tanks per year and no longer produces new Bradley Fighting Vehicles.) Additionally, we anticipate Russia to produce 250,000 artillery shells per month, which puts it on track to build a stockpile three times greater than the United States and Europe combined,” Cavoli wrote.

Cavoli did not provide comparative figures for Ukraine’s equipment losses and weapons production.

Moscow’s production capability for some items, such as artillery shells and cruise missiles, has expanded “tremendously,” and it’s building one-way attack drones “in prodigious numbers,” he told senators, noting that Russian ground forces are integrating reconnaissance and kamikaze drones into their offensive operations on the battlefield.

Ukraine has used a variety of weapons — including unmanned aerial systems, artillery and Javelin missiles, among others — to destroy Russian tanks and other equipment.

Cavoli noted that both sides in the conflict are also conducting long-range attacks, with the Russians deploying cruise missiles and glide bombs and the Ukrainians relying mainly on one-way attack drones.

Ukraine is also using “some indigenously produced cruise missile systems — one in particular that I’ve got in mind that we can talk about in closed session,” Cavoli told SASC members.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:26> This image shows destroyed Ukrainian tanks during Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:26>)
web_search("Ukraine Russia Kursk Oblast August 2024 tanks")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (<image:26>) of destroyed tanks appears in multiple sources. One source, from Sputnik Africa, published on October 17, 2024, reports that Ukraine has lost around 40 Leopard tanks since February 2022. Another source, The Moscow Times, published on June 13, 2023, states that Russia captured German Leopard tanks in the Zaporizhzhia region.

A third source, Defence Security Asia, published on May 19, 2024, discusses the destruction of German-made Leopard tanks in Ukraine and mentions that the Russian military claimed to have destroyed five Leopard 2A1 tanks between May 11 and 17, 2024. None of the sources mention Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024.


### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results discuss the 2024 Kursk offensive, which began on August 6, 2024, as part of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The Armed Forces of Ukraine launched an incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast. The article mentions the involvement of Ukrainian brigades, Russian forces, and North Korean forces. The article also mentions the number of casualties and equipment losses. The article includes a timeline of the campaign and mentions the capture of settlements and the destruction of bridges. The article also mentions the involvement of the 80th and 82nd Air Assault Brigades. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kursk_campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kursk_campaign))

Reuters reports on August 26, 2024, that Russia said Ukraine had lost 73 tanks, 61 armored personnel carriers and 404 armored combat vehicles in the Kursk region. The article also mentions an incursion by Ukraine into the Kursk region. ([https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-says-it-pummelled-ukrainian-forces-along-kursk-front-2024-08-26/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-says-it-pummelled-ukrainian-forces-along-kursk-front-2024-08-26/)) The Al Jazeera article, published on August 29, 2024, discusses Ukraine's ground offensive inside Russian territory, specifically in the Kursk region. <image:k> shows a building on fire in Sudzha, Russia, after a cross-border incursion of Ukrainian troops into the Kursk region on August 7, 2024. The article mentions that Russia was moving its aircraft back from airfields near the Ukrainian border. The article also mentions that the Kursk offensive had greatly reduced Russia’s use of aviation against northeastern Ukraine.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Ukraine launched an incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024, and that there were tank losses on the Ukrainian side. The Reuters article states that Russia claimed Ukraine lost 73 tanks in the Kursk region. The reverse image search shows that the image of destroyed tanks appears in multiple sources. However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that the image depicts destroyed Ukrainian tanks during the Kursk incursion.

To verify the claim, additional information is needed to confirm that the image specifically depicts the events of the Kursk incursion and that the destroyed tanks are Ukrainian.
