Useful result: From [Source](https://www.thejournal.ie/ukraine-hull-daily-mail-debunk-6657051-Mar2025/): 
Content: The search result from The Journal, published on March 26, 2025, debunks a fake Hull Daily Mail front page. The fake front page, which was widely shared on social media, claimed that "70,000 Ukrainian soldiers in the Kursk region died in vain." The article states that the Hull Daily Mail's parent company confirmed the headline was fake. <image:9855>, <image:9856>, <image:9857>.

The claim '<image:1> This image shows a screenshot of an authentic Hull Daily Mail's frontpage from March 13, 2025 saying '70,000 Ukrainian soldiers in the Kursk region died in vain. The UK poured hundreds of millions of pounds into Zelensky's crushing failure'.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. The front page of the Hull Daily Mail, as presented in the image, is fabricated. Fact-checkers, such as mythdetector.com ([https://mythdetector.com/en/british-hull-daily-mail/](https://mythdetector.com/en/british-hull-daily-mail/)), and The Journal ([https://www.thejournal.ie/ukraine-hull-daily-mail-debunk-6657051-Mar2025/](https://www.thejournal.ie/ukraine-hull-daily-mail-debunk-6657051-Mar2025/)), have debunked the image, confirming that the actual front page from March 13, 2025, had a different headline.

So, the overall veracity is: false
