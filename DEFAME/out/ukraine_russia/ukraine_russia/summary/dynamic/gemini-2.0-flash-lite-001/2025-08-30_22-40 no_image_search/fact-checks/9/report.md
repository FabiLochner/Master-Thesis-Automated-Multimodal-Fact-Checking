### Evidence from `web_search`
The BBC News article from November 12, 2024, discusses the ongoing incursion into Russia's Kursk region by Ukraine, with Volodymyr Zelensky stating the operation is holding down 50,000 Russian troops. The Moscow Times reports on the ongoing conflict in the Kursk region, mentioning a shock offensive launched by Kyiv in August 2024, and that Zelensky said Ukraine's army was still fighting in Russia's Kursk. ABC News, published on January 7, 2025, reports that Zelensky stated Ukraine is bringing the war "back to Russia" and that Russia has lost over 38,000 troops in the area since August, with fighting reported near Sudzha, which Ukraine captured in August.

## Elaboration
The claim is partially inaccurate. The image (![image 7](media/9.jpg)

## Final Judgement
The image shows Volodymyr Zelensky visiting troops in the Kharkiv region in May 2022, not in the Kursk region in August 2024. While there is evidence of a Kursk Offensive and Zelensky's involvement, the image's context is misrepresented.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image in the claim, which shows Volodymyr Zelensky, was taken in May 2022 in the Kharkiv region, not in August 2024 in the Kursk region as the claim states, as confirmed by the BBC ([https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-europe-61612803](https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-europe-61612803)). While there is evidence of a Kursk Offensive and Zelensky's involvement, the image's context is misrepresented.
