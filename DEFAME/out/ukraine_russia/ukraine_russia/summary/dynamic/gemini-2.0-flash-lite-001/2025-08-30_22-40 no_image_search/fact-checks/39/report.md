### Evidence from `web_search`
Jamie White, an Infowars reporter, was shot dead in Austin, Texas, according to articles from Yahoo News ([Source](https://www.yahoo.com/news/alex-jones-blames-globalists-infowars-182655321.html)) and The Latin Times ([Source](https://www.latintimes.com/infowars-reporter-assassinated-ukraine-outside-his-home-conspiracy-theorists-claim-578436)). Alex Jones speculated that Ukraine was responsible for the killing, claiming White was on a Ukrainian hit list. The Investigate Earth Conspiracy Podcast ([Source](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68lCuEsLtFn17oEIQBQGEk)) also discussed the murder and mentioned White may have been on a Ukrainian NGO hit list. ![image 782](media/2025-08-06_17-59-1754503177-996984.jpg) ![image 785](media/2025-08-06_17-59-1754503188-956198.jpg) ![image 791](media/2025-08-06_17-59-1754503192-610125.jpg) ![image 792](media/2025-08-06_17-59-1754503192-751914.jpg)


## Elaboration
The claim that Jamie White was on a Ukrainian hit list is supported by Alex Jones's speculation and a podcast discussion. However, the official reports from Fox 7 Austin ([https://www.fox7austin.com/news/infowars-writer-shooting-austin-police-jamie-white](https://www.fox7austin.com/news/infowars-writer-shooting-austin-police-jamie-white)) and ABC News ([https://abcnews.go.com/US/infowars-reporter-shot-dead-apartment-after-possibly-interrupting/story?id=119677965](https://abcnews.go.com/US/infowars-reporter-shot-dead-apartment-after-possibly-interrupting/story?id=119677965)) do not mention any connection to a Ukrainian hit list.

Therefore, the claim's veracity is uncertain, as it relies on speculative sources. More information is needed to confirm the existence of a Ukrainian hit list and White's alleged inclusion on it.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/crime/jamie-white-infowars-murder-alex-jones-b2712630.html): 
Content: The Independent reports that Jamie White's family believes the shooting was not targeted and that the suspects were trying to break into his car. Alex Jones accused Austin's Democratic district attorney and other Democrats of being responsible for White's death. The Austin Police Department stated that White was shot and killed in the parking lot of his apartment complex while possibly interrupting a burglary. The article does not mention any response from the Ukrainian government. ![image 9983](media/2025-08-30_22-48-1756594099-333265.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the claim is not definitively supported. While Alex Jones and a podcast have speculated about a Ukrainian hit list, official reports and the victim's family suggest a different scenario. The Independent article ([https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/crime/jamie-white-infowars-murder-alex-jones-b2712630.html](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/crime/jamie-white-infowars-murder-alex-jones-b2712630.html)) does not mention any response from the Ukrainian government.


## Final Judgement
The claim that Jamie White was on a Ukrainian hit list is not supported by the available evidence. While some sources, such as Alex Jones, have speculated about this, official reports and the victim's family suggest the shooting was related to a car burglary. There is no definitive evidence to confirm the claim.

`false`
