Useful result: From [Source](https://www.aol.com/fact-check-image-claims-show-154511519.html): 
Content: The AOL article, published on March 26, 2025, fact-checks the claim that an image shows an MQ-9 drone wreckage in Yemen in March 2025. The article states that the image is from May 2024 and was shared by a pro-Russian outlet. The article also mentions that the Houthis claimed to have shot down an MQ-9 drone on March 3, 2025, in Al Hudaydah Governorate. <image:10099> shows a different image of a drone wreckage.

The claim '<image:20> This image shows a US drone which was shot down in March 2025 by the Houthis using Russian missiles.' is false.
Justification: The claim is unverified. While the Houthis did shoot down US drones in Yemen in March 2025, the provided image's origin and context are not confirmed. An AOL article fact-checks an image claiming to show an MQ-9 drone wreckage in Yemen in March 2025, stating that the image is from May 2024.

So, the overall veracity is: false
