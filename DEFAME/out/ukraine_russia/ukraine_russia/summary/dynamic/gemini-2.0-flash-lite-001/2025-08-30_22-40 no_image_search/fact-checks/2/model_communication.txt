Trump slams Zelenskyy on Truth Social for saying the end of the Russia war ‘is still very, very far away’
=========================================================================================================

[Politics](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics)
 Mar 3, 2025 1:01 PM EDT

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump slammed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Monday for suggesting that the end of Russia’s war against Ukraine is still likely “very, very far away.”

[**READ MORE:** Fact-checking Trump and Vance’s attacks on Ukrainian President Zelenskyy](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/fact-checking-trump-and-vances-attacks-on-ukrainian-president-zelenskyy)

“This is the worst statement that could have been made by Zelenskyy, and America will not put up with it for much longer!” Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform.

Zelenskyy late Sunday said he believed the war would go on for some time, while trying to offer a positive take about the U.S.-Ukraine relationship in the aftermath of his [contentious White House meeting](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/in-clash-with-zelenskyy-trump-deepens-diplomatic-rift-over-russias-war-in-ukraine)
 with the Republican president and Vice President JD Vance.

“I think our relationship (with the U.S.) will continue, because it’s more than an occasional relationship,” Zelenskyy said, referring to Washington’s support for the past three years of war.

But Trump seemed further irritated by Zelenskyy’s latest comments suggesting it will take time for the three-year conflict to come to a close.

“It is what I was saying, this guy doesn’t want there to be Peace as long as he has America’s backing and, Europe, in the meeting they had with Zelenskyy, stated flatly that they cannot do the job without the U.S. “What are they thinking?”

We're not going anywhere.

A potential deal between the United States and Ukraine intended to pave the way for an end to the war with Russia was up in the air Friday, after a meeting between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office on Friday grew contentious.

Trump told Zelenskyy, "You're not acting at all thankful" for the support Zelenskyy's country had received from the United States, adding that the Ukrainian leader had been disrespectful and telling him, "You're gambling with World War III."

[!President Trump looks on during a joint press conference with U.K. <image:1569>](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5310647/trump-week-ukraine-russia)

### [Trump, Zelenskyy shouting match underscores change in U.S. foreign policy](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5310647/trump-week-ukraine-russia)

Zelenskyy tried to object, saying he has "all the respect for your country" and saying, "I said thanks," as Trump raised his voice to speak over him.

A scheduled news conference between the two men was subsequently canceled. Zelenskyy left the White House but didn't take questions.

Zelenskyy came to Washington and was expected to [sign a deal](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5312880/trump-zelenskyy-minerals-ukraine-russia)
 that would give the United States access to [Ukrainian rare earth and critical minerals](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/26/nx-s1-5309996/ukraine-rare-earth-minerals-metals-deal)
. But the heated session — with raised voices and cross talk playing out in front of TV cameras — left the future of the negotiations uncertain.

The argument came at the end of a lengthy question-and-answer session with reporters, after Trump defended his [approach with Russian President Vladimir Putin](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/18/nx-s1-5300669/us-russia-ukraine-saudi-arabia-summit)

    5:02 PM UTC President Donald Trump denounced Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy as a "dictator" on Wednesday and warned he had to move quickly to secure peace or risk losing his country, deepening a feud between the two leaders that has alarmed European officials.

The extraordinary attacks - a day after Trump claimed Ukraine was to blame for Russia's 2022 invasion - heightened concerns among U.S. and Russian officials that have sidelined Ukraine.

"A Dictator without Elections, Zelenskyy better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left," Trump wrote on social media, using an alternate spelling for the Ukrainian president's name.

In response, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said no one could force his country to give in.

"We will defend our right to exist," Sybiha said on X.

Later in the day while speaking to investors and executives in Miami, Trump doubled down on his comments, again calling Zelenskiy a "dictator" and suggesting the Ukrainian president wanted to prolong the war to "keep the gravy train going," a reference to U.S. security ally Australia, which has provided A$1.5 billion in support to Ukraine in its war with Russia, rejected Trump's assertions about Ukraine.

Less than a month into his presidency, Trump has [upended U.S. military aid.

Zelenskiy's five-year term was supposed to end in 2024, but elections cannot be held under martial law, which Ukraine imposed in February 2022 in response to Russia's invasion.

Content: "<image:1595>

A Dutch journalist's claim that a Russian strike allegedly killed 18 British special forces soldiers and injured another 25 has sparked a wildfire online, drawing over 2.5 million readers.

Sonja van den Ende, a Dutch journalist barred from entering Ukraine, has spread false information claiming the death of a British military unit during a Russian missile strike in Odesa, [reported](https://www.facebook.com/100002112339132/posts/7875505409196459/?rdid=O497WKy9ZWbwIThj)
 Southern Defense Forces spokesperson Dmytro Pletenchuk.

"Sometimes, it happens that you're so discredited that you're banned from entering Ukraine for many years, but that doesn't stop you from creating sensational fake news about the war in Ukraine," Pletenchuk said, commenting on the Dutch journalist's post.

He pointed out that French journalist ‘buried an entire unit of foreign soldiers’ who were allegedly in Odesa.

"In her note, Sonja van den Ende 'killed' an entire British SAS unit in Odesa. She reached over 2.5 million readers on her X page, claiming that 'the Russian strike killed 18 British special forces soldiers and injured another 25'," Pletenchuk commented.

He noted that the Dutch journalist provided no evidence for her claims.

Sonja van den Ende is a Dutch journalist who, since 2015, has been actively spreading narratives sympathetic to Russia. She has also written about supposed Ukrainian "biolabs," Zelensky's threats to Donbas, and claims that Ukrainian Armed Forces are shelling peaceful cities.

The Dutch journalist loves traveling around Russia and frequently praises the country on her social media.

They verified this information in the press service of the Tavria Operational grouping of troops, where they denied the presence of British special forces in Odesa and the event itself. Speaker of the Ukrainian Navy, Dmytro Pletenchuk, also denied this information.

Propagandists spread such fakes in order to support their information campaign about “foreign mercenaries” in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. However, this information is not true.

One claim, originating from a Dutch journalist, alleges that a Russian strike killed 18 British special forces soldiers in Odesa, but this has been debunked by Ukrainian military officials. Another article reports that Russian special forces captured two British officers in Ukraine.

The first claim is discussed in articles from [UA Wire](https://www.uawire.org/false-allegations-of-british-sas-casualties-in-odesa-dutch-journalist-s-controversial-claims-debunked-by-ukrainian-military) and [Detector Media](https://disinfo.detector.media/en/post/russian-aircraft-allegedly-destroyed-a-british-special-forces-group-in-odesa). The second claim is discussed in an article from [EADaily](https://eadaily.com/en/news/2025/08/04/these-are-not-tourists-two-british-colonels-were-captured-by-russian-special-forces). <image:1595>


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the claim about 18 British Special Forces being killed in the Odessa region in November 2024 is false. The search results reveal that Ukrainian military officials debunked this claim, which originated from a Dutch journalist. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the available evidence.


## Final Judgement
The claim is demonstrably false. The search results show that the claim about the death of 18 British Special Forces in Odessa, Ukraine, was debunked by Ukrainian military officials.

`false`

**A Fake Story And A Fake News Site**

To further bolster the disinformation campaign, the Seattle Times was filled with other news articles, although those appear to rely heavily on AI-generated content culled from other local news sites.

[BBC Verify's Shayan Sardarizadeh reported](https://x.com/Shayan86/status/1843706641000345981 "https://x.com/Shayan86/status/1843706641000345981")
 that not only is there no such news outlet based in Seattle, but that the website was only set up in the past week "specifically to post this fake story."

The effort was almost certainly implemented to raise questions regarding any future support for Zelensky, but also to bolster the Kremlin's claim that its "special military operation" was directed at "de-Nazifying" Ukraine.

**Mixing Truth Into The Fiction**
---------------------------------

What makes this story about Hitler's automobile ending up in Ukraine seem all the more believable is that the fake news site included key facts about the car's history.

The Nazi dictator's Mercedes-Benz 770 Grosser Offener Tourenwagen was indeed used in the victory parade after Germany defeated France, and it was previously listed by Worldwide Auctioneers in 2018 as the faux news piece reported. [](https://www.forbes.com/)

Misinformation and disinformation campaigns on social media could be increasingly difficult to identify, as new tools and efforts attempt to make the stories seem legitimate. It was reportedly the same car that the German despot rode in during his victory parade after the defeat of France in June 1940. Photos of the car in that news article and on social media appeared to be from the auction house.

This story evokes memories of the infamous "Hitler diaries," which turned out to be forgeries.

**Hitler's Ride Is Now In A Private Collection**
------------------------------------------------

Despite the efforts that were taken, the disinformation campaign was still easy enough to debunk with a few searches. They are rarely driven, period."

Sending a car this expensive a long distance would certainly bring on its own set of challenges.

"It would have to be closely guarded, lots of security, and would probably wind up on a private cargo plane somehow, with a security escort," Earnest continued.

**Details, Details, Details**
-----------------------------

The reporting from the "Seattle Tribune" didn't go into when Zelensky bought the car, but enough truths were mixed in that the story sounded credible.

Those with commonsense might question why Zelensky would spend millions of dollars on the car and bring it to Kyiv, which regularly comes under attack from Russian drones and missiles—but disinformation typically relies on people believing the claim without doing further research or asking such questions.

"The Hitler's car story is an obvious piece of propaganda by those seeking to undermine Ukraine," explained social media analyst Greg Sterling, co-founder of Near Media. A recent fake news story has been making the rounds this week, citing a report from a seemingly mainstream news outlet.

The story in question suggested that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky recently spent $15 million to buy a Mercedes 770 automobile that was previously owned by Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler. In the past, however, the supporting evidence of the dubious claims was little more than photos and anonymous sources.

In July, a post went so far as to show a "sales receipt" for a Bugatti sportscar purportedly bought by Olena Zelenska, wife of President Zelensky. Notably, AutoEvolution.com reported in 2022 that the car is now in the car collection of Australian billionaire Clive Palmer.

"The auction prompted a $7 million bid but the reserve was not met. No word on how much Palmer ended up paying for it, but he did put in two years' worth of negotiations," [the auto website stated](https://www.autoevolution.com/news/hitlers-armored-mercedes-770k-limo-is-now-part-of-billionaires-private-collection-182835.html "https://www.autoevolution.com/news/hitlers-armored-mercedes-770k-limo-is-now-part-of-billionaires-private-collection-182835.html")
. There is no indication that Palmer has sold it.

An attempt to reach out to Palmer was not answered.

However, it would be unclear that Palmer could have sold such a vehicle without it gaining considerable attention.

"It's certainly not unheard of for very high-profile and über-valuable cars to change hands privately, but it typically isn't the norm," explained Brian Earnest, editorial director of _Old Cars Magazine._ "If a seller is looking for the best price, they will usually have their best luck publicizing the sale well ahead of time and turning it over to one of the big auction houses, who attract the wealthy buyers, know who the 'whales' are, and have experience handling and selling 'star' cars and investment grade vehicles."

Earnest said there are "plenty" of high-end exotic cars that have changed hands privately over the years, but it would be doubtful Zelensky could rent a car without it gaining much media attention.

"The car in question didn't sell for a reported bid of $7 million fairly recently, but it's not out of the question it could sell for $15 million," added Earnest."

Russian propagandists push fake story that Zelenskyy bought Hitler's car

Russian propagandists push fake story that Zelenskyy bought Hitler's car

Print

washington — 

The article in the Seattle Tribune had everything: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Adolf Hitler and a $15 million classic car. Unsurprisingly, it spread like wildfire across Russia's state and pro-Kremlin media.

But the subject was a strange one for a news site about a U.S. city; such outlets usually cover only local stories.

In fact, the article with headline "Hitler's parade car bought by Ukraine's Zelensky" was another fake spread by Russian propaganda.

There is no such media outlet as the Seattle Tribune, just a website masquerading as a full-fledged publication. And the article itself was a compilation of Russia's disinformation "greatest hits" about Ukraine — "Nazism," "unrestrained corruption" and "wasting American aid."

According to the phony news article, Zelenskyy was spotted in Kyiv exiting a Mercedes-Benz 770K Grosser Offener Tourenwagen, Adolf Hitler's parade car. The sighting supposedly occurred just days after the Ukrainian leader returned from Washington, where the U.S. government had allocated an $8 billion aid package to his country.

The article featured a screenshot of a post by the Ukrainian Telegram messenger channel Realna Viyna ("Real War" in Ukrainian) featuring a photo of the vehicle parked in front of the Ukrainian presidential administration building in Kyiv.

![A screenshot of a fake Ukrainian Telegram messenger channel post includes a doctored photo of "Hitler's car" parked in front of the Ukrainian presidential administration.](https://gdb.voanews.com/e4bf172f-29ce-4381-8cfd-b641a37657e1_w250_r0_s.png)

A screenshot of a fake Ukrainian Telegram messenger channel post includes a doctored photo of "Hitler's car" parked in front of the Ukrainian presidential administration.

However, beyond the Seattle Tribune news site not actually existing, the article had several other glaring problems.

First, Realna Viyna did not publish the post in the screenshot. Second, the image of "Hitler's car" was stolen from a photo widely available on the internet that was digitally edited into an image of the Ukrainian presidential administration building.

!A post on Pinterest shows an image that was used to create a doctored photo of "Hitler's car" parked in front of the Ukrainian presidential administration. <image:164>

A post on Pinterest shows an image that was used to create a doctored photo of "Hitler's car" parked in front of the Ukrainian presidential administration.

VOA found that the angle of photo in the screenshot, a black spot on the asphalt under the car's running board, and the reflection on the front windshield completely match the image of the Mercedes-Benz 770K found across the internet.

Third, the Seattle Tribune website was registered on October 3, 2024, just six days before the fake article was published. And the registration was set for only one year.

The Seattle Tribune appears to belong to a network of disinformation websites controlled by John Mark Dougan, an American living in Russia, according to Shayan Sardarizadeh, a journalist who fact checks and debunks disinformation at the BBC.

He noted on social network X that creating fake local American news sites is Dougan's standard approach. That conclusion matches VOA's observations about Dougan's network.

A former deputy sheriff in Florida, Dougan was charged with extortion and wiretapping in the United States. In 2016, he fled to Russia and later received political asylum there.

He now operates at least 167 disinformation sites that often publish narratives serving Russian interests, according to a May 2024 investigation by [NewsGuard.](https://www.newsguardtech.com/press/special-report-newsguard-and-new-book-expose-global-disinformation-reach-of-moscow-based-former-florida-sheriffs-deputy/)

[Dougan's sites](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c72ver6172do)
 previously attracted widespread attention for spreading a fake story claiming that Ukraine's first lady, Olena Zelenska, had purchased a $4.8 million Bugatti supercar during a visit to France for commemorations of the D-Day landing.

That story seemed to be aimed at a Western audience. The fake "Hitler car" story, however, is mostly spreading in the Russian information space. In a message on the Telegram messenger, Dougan told VOA that he was unaware of the Seattle Tribune_._

"Never heard of it. But I looked it up \[and\] heard there's lots of great information on there. A real pillar of journalistic integrity, on par with the NYT, CNN and MSNBC," he wrote, referring to _The New York Times_ and two major U.S. TV news channels.

As is often the case with higher-quality fakes, the phony story about Hitler's parade car combines a fictitious narrative about Zelenskyy with real facts about the sale of a former Nazi parade car in the United States.

The factual information comes from an article in a real American newspaper: _The Seattle Times,_ which reported in February 2018 that [the Mercedes-Benz 770K had briefly appeared in the Seattle area](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/how-hitlers-car-ended-up-parked-in-medina/)
 after having been put up for auction in Scottsdale, Arizona, a month earlier.

While the vehicle did not sell at the auction, it soon found a buyer. After that, the "Hitler car" was briefly unloaded from a truck in the wealthy Seattle suburb of Medina, where it attracted the attention of a local resident, who told _The Seattle Times_ about it. Later, the car was likely reloaded onto the truck and taken way.

The director of the auction company Worldwide Auctioneers, Rod Egan (his name was also mentioned in the fake Seattle Tribune story), refused to tell _The Seattle Time_s the buyer of the car, citing a non-disclosure agreement.

However, Egan said the car's ultimate destination was "very, very far away" outside the United States.

_The Seattle Times_ article also cited a German media report that six such cars were bought by a Russian billionaire in 2009. Among them was the vehicle mentioned in the fake article.

The fake story about Zelenskyy and the "Hitler car" also recalled a scene from the 2001 American comedy film "Rat Race," in which actor Jon Lovitz steals Hitler's parade car from a fictional museum of Nazi SS officer Klaus Barbie and then crashes it into a gathering of American World War II veterans.

Asked whether he was familiar with the film and scene, Dougan replied, "Comedy gold right there."

Russian media spread hoax about Zelensky buying Hitler’s car for $15 million
============================================================================

11 October 2024

[](/en/authors/the-insider)

[##### The Insider](/en/authors/the-insider)

[**_RU_**](https://theins.press/antifake/275180)

A series of fake publications about President Volodymyr Zelensky's alleged multi-million dollar purchases — including a hotel with a casino in Northern Cyprus, a winery in Tuscany that belonged to a famous British musician, and a brand new Bugatti for Ukraine’s First Lady — has been updated with an unbelievable new addition: the story that Zelensky has ostensibly purchased Adolf Hitler's parade car and drives it around Kyiv. The Russian tabloid _Moskovsky Komsomolets_ ”[reports](https://www.mk.ru/politics/2024/10/08/zelenskiy-kupil-mersedes-gitlera-za-astronomicheskuyu-summu.html)
”:

> “Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky has purchased a car that belonged to Adolf Hitler. The Nazi Fuhrer rode in this Mercedes at the parade in Berlin after the surrender of France in 1940. The purchase was reported by _Seattle Tribune_.

> “As the publication writes, the car was noticed in the center of Kyiv in early October. It had brought Zelensky to the administration building on Bankova Street. This happened shortly after Zelensky returned from his American tour.

> “The article says that the amount Zelensky paid for the Mercedes-Benz 770k is unknown, but experts estimate its value as approximately $15 million. The Nazi dictator's car was confiscated by the U.S. Army after the war ended.”

_Argumenty i Fakty_ throws in some [details](https://aif.ru/politics/world/seattle-tribune-zelenskiy-kupil-paradnyy-limuzin-gitlera)
:

> “The United States attempted to auction the car in 2018. The endeavor failed because the $7 million bid fell short of the expected value. Subsequently, representatives stated they were negotiating the sale of the car with a client outside the U.S.”

![](/images/PJA9qLuVPnDCVQFT36GVoRhJDpYG41YEEmwqC8KGZzk/rs:fill:433:562:0:0/dpr:2/q:80/bG9jYWw6L3B1Ymxp/Yy9zdG9yYWdlL2Nv/bnRlbnRfYmxvY2sv/aW1hZ2UvMjg5NzYv/ZmlsZS00NzdjMDlh/MGQ3NGVlMjEyNTRl/NmU4NDI0ZjU5Mjdl/Zi5qcGc.jpg)

The failed 2018 auction story is true — except that the negotiations did in fact end in February 2022, with the car being [purchased](https://www.thetimes.com/world/article/australian-politician-clive-palmer-buys-hitlers-mercedes-from-russian-tycoon-hlzpn20vf)
 by Australian national Clive Palmer for his future car museum. According to _The Times_, its previous owner was a Russian tycoon who had bought the car for more than $7 million. However, after Palmer was suspected in Australia of violating the anti-Russian sanctions regime and glorifying Nazism, he [denied](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-03-02/clive-palmer-reportedly-buys-hitlers-car/100874720)
 the purchase.

_Seattle Tribune_, which first wrote about Zelensky's purchase of the car, is one of many fake publications created to plant dirt against Putin’s enemies. Olena Zelenska's fictional purchase of a Bugatti was reported by the non-existent French publication _Vérité Cachée_ in July 2024 using a similar method. The website of _Seattle Tribune_ was registered just a few days ago, and the Internet Archive [shows](https://web.archive.org/web/20241003162854/https:/seattle-tribune.com/)
 that on Oct. 3, 2024, it was completely empty.

![](/images/n_infmIDLGIc64dpaqUUZFl0ar-9-4ysK9mh30_K6v0/rs:fit:866:0:0:0/dpr:2/q:80/bG9jYWw6L3B1Ymxp/Yy9zdG9yYWdlL2Nv/bnRlbnRfYmxvY2sv/aW1hZ2UvMjg5Nzcv/ZmlsZS0yNzVhNzRh/MTg4MzVlYWZlZmZl/MDRmMDk2MDdlNGM0/YS5qcGc.jpg)

The pseudo-American publication [presents](https://seattle-tribune.com/hitlers-parade-car-bought-by-ukraines-zelensky/)
 a screenshot ostensibly captured from the Ukrainian Telegram channel “Real War | Ukraine | News” with a photo of a car outside the Ukrainian president's office building.

![](/images/BKCFlFjgqajb2a869v73hlrvaWyQRlD2DYAySfdwh9A/rs:fit:866:0:0:0/dpr:2/q:80/bG9jYWw6L3B1Ymxp/Yy9zdG9yYWdlL2Nv/bnRlbnRfYmxvY2sv/aW1hZ2UvMjg5Nzgv/ZmlsZS01ZTgzNWU0/OTliZGNhMzc5NjQz/MjQ3YzIzNGNmYzcx/OC5qcGc.jpg)

Of course, the channel published no such post, and the image itself was doctored. The car was cut from a photo that [illustrated](https://ru.axar.az/news/vmire/235827.html)
 the auction announcements on various websites in 2017.

![](/images/jImvSXip56iyK9-6Y6tFeFIZ5IH0sg4LmaY1Wiy8Xwg/rs:fit:866:0:0:0/dpr:2/q:80/bG9jYWw6L3B1Ymxp/Yy9zdG9yYWdlL2Nv/bnRlbnRfYmxvY2sv/aW1hZ2UvMjg5Nzkv/ZmlsZS02NDA5ZWM2/OTM2YmJhYzJjZTc4/ZDdjMjExN2E2M2Q3/Yy5qcGc.jpg)

As we can see, tree reflections in the fenders of the car in the two images match — and there are no trees this big anywhere near the building on Bankova Street. The authors of the hoax only tried to blur the reflection of the American police car in the door, and they weren't too thorough about it, leaving visible traces of the partially erased reflection. The license plates are blurred too — an understandable move for the original 2017 photo, when the car belonged to a private owner — but why would one care to hide the license plates of a presidential car that Zelensky purportedly uses to get to his office and drive around Kyiv?

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is once again the target of disinformation for allegedly spending money intended for the Ukrainian Army. This time, it is claimed he bought the famous Mercedes-Benz 770, whose most famous owner was Hitler. The claims come from the “news portal” Seattle Tribune, created a few days before the breaking news, while the main source is a manipulated screenshot from Telegram. Not only such a photo does not exist on the Telegram group that is quoted, the illustration is also a montage of two different pictures.

Disinformation attacks on Ukrainian President **Volodymyr** **Zelensky** have been a constant since the war in Ukraine started. This time, it is claimed he allegedly bought the “Mercedes-Benz 770” car or the “Großer Mercedes” (the “Grand Mercedes”) of the infamous dictator of Nazi Germany, **Adolf Hitler,** for 15 million dollars**.** It is true the “Mercedes-Benz 770” was one of the most famous and most used models in the ranks of the Nazi Party in Germany and that it was this car which Hitler used for the [victory parade in France](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/16/hitlers-wartime-mercedes-car-to-be-sold-in-scottsdale-arizona.html#:~:text=Hitler%20used%20it%20for%20a%20victory%20parade%20after%20the%20Nazis%E2%80%99%20swift%20defeat%20of%20France)
. However, as early as 2018, the car was auctioned in [Arizona, USA](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/16/hitlers-wartime-mercedes-car-to-be-sold-in-scottsdale-arizona.html)
. This disinformation was also fact-checked by numerous colleagues from Lithuania ([15min](https://www.15min.lt/naujiena/aktualu/pasaulis/ar-tiesa-kad-v-zelenskis-isigijo-a-hitlerio-automobili-57-2323218)
 and [Delfi](https://www.delfi.lt/news/melo-detektorius/klastote/ka-zinome-apie-netanyahu-sulaikymo-atvaizda-120022860)

 and [Center for Countering Disinformation](https://cpd.gov.ua/en/international-threats-en/fake-about-zelenskyys-purchase-of-hitlers-parade-car/)

, [Australia](https://www.aap.com.au/factcheck/russian-disinformation-campaign-accuses-zelensky-of-spending-millions-on-cars/)
, as well as the diplomatic service of the EU, [EUvsDisinfo](https://euvsdisinfo.eu/report/zelenskyy-buys-hitlers-mercedes/)

“The news” has started to spread relatively quickly in the Baltic states and Ukraine, with a picture or [video](https://www.facebook.com/psimeonoff/videos/570591355306096)
 being shared, as well as a direct link from the website [Seattle Tribune](https://seattle-tribune.com/hitlers-parade-car-bought-by-ukraines-zelensky/)
, which at first sight resembles a real news portal.

**Photo: Screenshot from [Seattle Tribune](https://seattle-tribune.com/hitlers-parade-car-bought-by-ukraines-zelensky/)
**

However, numerous problematic moments surrounding the portal can be recognized immediately. Firstly, according to the [US Library of Congress](https://www.loc.gov/item/sn87093403/)
, the weekly newspaper “Seattle Tribune” was founded in 1931 and it is not known exactly when in the last century it was shut down. Consequently, no data can be found on whether the portal with the same name, created later on, has anything to do with the original.

Secondly, since the site is first registered [on the 3rd of October, 2024](https://who.is/whois/seattle-tribune.com)
, a few days before the breaking news about Zelensky was published, it is very suspicious. There is no Impressum on the website, nor are there links to the journalists who write the news, the date the news was published or any other information about the portal itself. This is clear indication that this site impersonates a real news portal through which vectors of disinformation attacks are created, which is [a well-known tactic.](https://vistinomer.mk/proveruvachi-na-fakti-go-iscrtaa-patot-na-ruskite-dezinformacii-za-zelenski-i-najbliskite/)

It is also suspicious how the main source of this news is actually a screenshot from a channel on the Telegram platform, called [“Реальна Війна”](https://t.me/s/voynareal)
 or Real War (there is no link to the Telegram post).

**Photo: manipulated picture from Seattle Tribune, allegedly sourced from the Telegram group “Real War”** 

The picture itself, portraying the “Mercedes”, allegedly parked in front of the Presidential Palace of Ukraine, is obvious to be altered with at least two pictures.

One of the pictures, from the Presidential Palace in Kyiv, can be found on [Adobe Stock](https://stock.adobe.com/images/kiev-ukraine-august-04-2021-office-building-of-the-president-of-ukraine-city-of-kyiv/482821474?prev_url=detail)
 — a site for downloading photos for commercial use. The other, can be found on the [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/859132066386149502/)
 platform. The photo manipulation is done so that the photo of the car is superimposed over the other photo of the palace. The same reflections can be seen from the fenders of the “Mercedes” and the hood. Moreover, the picture shows the weather was sunny, or at least clear. Meanwhile, on the 6th of October, when this disinformation actually began to be spread, the weather forecast for Kyiv indicated [record rainfall.](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-regions/3913586-u-kievi-6-zovtna-zafiksuvali-rekordnu-kilkist-opadiv.html)

#### **Inspiration behind the disinformation**  

As in all previous cases when Zelensky and his family members were the [target of disinformation](https://vistinomer.mk/proveruvachi-na-fakti-go-iscrtaa-patot-na-ruskite-dezinformacii-za-zelenski-i-najbliskite/)
, it was usually preceded by an important event that will wake up the Russian propagandists in order to distract attention elsewhere. More specifically, to undermine the trust not only of the citizens of Ukraine, but also of politicians and allies from the USA and the West who supply them with financial and military aid. And with that, prolong or block the help they are receiving, as was the case during the winter with the [US Congress.](https://vistinomer.mk/ruski-razorni-dezinformacii-ja-potpaluvaat-amerikanskata-politichka-scena/)

This time, the possible reason might be that one week before the website Seattle Tribune was created, Zelensky was in the United States. More specifically, on the 23rd of September he was in the state of [Pennsylvania](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/23/europe/ukraine-zelensky-pennsylvania-us-visit-intl-hnk/index.html)
, where he visited an ammunition factory, while a few days later, on the 26th of September, he presented his [“Victory Plan”](https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20240926-ukraine-will-prevail-joe-biden-tells-volodymyr-zelensky-after-pledging-8-billion-in-military-aid-to-kyiv)
 in the Oval Office in the White House.

On another note, six times just this year, Truthmeter.mk has fact-checked different disinformation surrounding the alleged luxuries of Zelensky, according to which, it turns out he has allegedly spent over one billion dollars intended as aid for the Ukrainian Army.

Dafina Kandova, a journalist with the Bulgarian checking organization factcheck.bg, told AFCL that her organization had [checked](https://factcheck.bg/ne-e-vyarno-che-amerikanskata-kompaniya-blackrock-zabranyava-na-ukrajna-da-pogrebva-ubitite-si-vojnici-si-v-grobishta/)

 similar rumors circulating in Bulgaria at the end of 2023.

Dafina added that while Plamen Paskov often appears as a commentator for the Bulgarian nationalist Ataka party, he is not actually an official member of the party and has not been elected to public office.

Paskov’s popularity is largely built on social media, gaining followers by spreading conspiracy theories related to hot topics such as COVID-19 and the war in Ukraine, she added. 6, 2024.

“BlackRock purchased 47% of Ukraine’s arable lands … BlackRock has asked the Ukrainian government to stop burying deceased Ukrainian soldiers and look for other ways to take care of them because it wants to use the lands in a different way,” reads the claim in part.

Zhao cited a Bulgarian politician named Plamen Paskov whose claim about BlackRock's land ownership in Ukraine was previously [shared](https://big5.sputniknews.cn/20240802/1060759436.html)
 by Russia's state-run Sputnik news agency.

‘In an article published in early August, Russian and Chinese media quoted a purported Bulgarian politician as saying that U.S. The New York-based multinational asset manager has a big enough stake in many influential companies worldwide to push them to change decisions and priorities.

According to a Ukrainian government [press release](https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/prezident-obgovoriv-z-generalnim-direktorom-blackrock-koordi-80105)
, President Volodymyr Zelensky met BlackRock CEO Larry Fink to discuss how Ukraine could raise national reconstruction funds at the end of 2022.

But the claim about BlackRock’s land ownership in Ukraine and its request to the government regarding deceased soldiers is false.

Under Ukrainian law, foreign companies and individuals are [prohibited](https://www.fao.org/faolex/results/details/en/c/LEX-FAOC043459/)

On June 23-24, Russian-language Facebook accounts ([1](https://www.facebook.com/olga.petkevich.1/posts/pfbid0zFb8scpYzp1pemiXc82TUkYLAcd6MCyL35uNww8jr6aRcY5vT25dNUPtRSsfLR1Dl)
,[2](https://www.facebook.com/anastasiya.nogovicyna/posts/pfbid02dJ5anhinp72uF6vdapbShugY5SiL4EYhXDakgN9YRjCwK21HDVj6cWmWsJhLfpnJl)
) reported that 17 million hectares of Ukrainian agricultural land were already transferred to international corporations within the framework of the “Ukraine Development Fund” created in 2023. The posts state that the creator of this fund, Larry Fink, who is the head of the American corporation BlackRock, banned the burial of dead Ukrainian soldiers on this land, because “unsustainable waste of valuable arable land” is inappropriate.

Identical posts were published by Russian-language users ([1](https://www.facebook.com/100050002686731/videos/2243608662643791)
,[2](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid02436rJyqZ29mLzwfwB6749KG1EHHknwMEJT6WMSA7RBLxSBq7fShqoN7viQzb4YWUl&id=100006870016043)
) on May 12. Ukrainian legislation prohibits foreign companies from purchasing agricultural land.**

Russian director, actor, and propagandist Nikita Mikhalkov also voiced the claim that Larry Fink, the co-founder and CEO of the American company BlackRock, forbade the burial of Ukrainian soldiers killed in the Russian-Ukrainian war on Ukrainian soil. The claim that Ukraine was sold to the mentioned company is a Russian propaganda narrative, which is also [voiced](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/kyiv-has-sold-ukraine-to-blackrock-russia-lambasts-ukraine-for-taking-support-from-us/videoshow/106731755.cms?from=mdr)
 by Russian high-ranking officials.

It is also false to claim that international corporations have bought 17 million hectares of Ukrainian land. For more details, see:

Russian-language Facebook accounts Olga Petkevich, Anastasiya Nogovicyna, Архангел Михаил and Robindranat Tagor regularly disseminate disinformation of anti-Western and anti-Ukrainian content.

### War and Theft: The Takeover of Ukraine’s Agricultural Land exposes the financial interests and the dynamics at play leading to further concentration of land and finance.

The total amount of land controlled by oligarchs, corrupt individuals, and large agribusinesses is over nine million hectares — exceeding 28 percent of Ukraine’s arable land. <image:2886>](https://www.oaklandinstitute.org/war-theft-takeover-ukraine-agricultural-land)
Western financing to Ukraine in recent years has been tied to a drastic structural adjustment program that has required austerity and privatization measures, including the creation of a land market for the sale of agricultural land. With the land market in place, amidst high economic stress and war, this difference of treatment will lead to more land consolidation by large agribusinesses.

The report also sounds the alarm that Ukraine’s crippling debt is being used as a leverage by the financial institutions to drive post-war reconstruction towards further privatization and liberalization reforms in several sectors, including agriculture.

War And Theft: The Takeover of Ukraine’s Agricultural Land
==========================================================

by Frédéric Mousseau and Eve Devillers. <image:2887>](https://www.oaklandinstitute.org/war-theft-takeover-ukraine-agricultural-land)
This report addresses this gap – identifying the interests controlling Ukraine’s agricultural land and presenting an analysis of the dynamics at play around land tenure in the country. This includes the highly controversial land reform that took place in 2021 as part of the structural adjustment program initiated under the auspices of Western financial institutions, after the installation of a pro-European Union (EU) government following the Maidan Revolution in 2014.

With 33 million hectares of arable land, Ukraine has large swaths of the most fertile farmland in the world. <image:2888>](https://www.oaklandinstitute.org/war-theft-takeover-ukraine-agricultural-land)
In addition, according to the government, about five million hectares – the size of two Crimea – have been “stolen” by private interests from the state of Ukraine."

The article mentions that foreign companies are prohibited from purchasing arable land in Ukraine and includes an image <image:2869>. Myth Detector ([https://mythdetector.com/en/ukrainian-lands-and-banned-the-burial-of-military-personnel/](https://mythdetector.com/en/ukrainian-lands-and-banned-the-burial-of-military-personnel/)) also fact-checks the claim as false, stating it originated from a satirical Telegram channel. BlackRock co-founder and CEO Larry Fink announced the creation of the Ukraine Reconstruction Fund in January 2023.

The Oakland Institute's report ([https://tlio.org.uk/war-and-theft-the-hostile-takeover-of-ukraines-agricultural-land-private-equitys-21st-century-war-for-global-enclosure-and-slavery/](https://tlio.org.uk/war-and-theft-the-hostile-takeover-of-ukraines-agricultural-land-private-equitys-21st-century-war-for-global-enclosure-and-slavery/)) discusses land ownership in Ukraine but does not mention BlackRock's policy on the burial of Ukrainian soldiers. The report includes multiple images <image:2885>, <image:2886>, <image:2887>, <image:2888>.


## Elaboration
The claim is false. Multiple sources, including The Asia Fact Check Lab ([https://www.rfa.org/english/news/afcl/afcl-blackrock-ukraine-land-08262024030948.html](https://www.rfa.org/english/news/afcl/afcl-blackrock-ukraine-land-08262024030948.html)) and Myth Detector ([https://mythdetector.com/en/ukrainian-lands-and-banned-the-burial-of-military-personnel/](https://mythdetector.com/en/ukrainian-lands-and-banned-the-burial-of-military-personnel/)), have fact-checked the claim and found it to be untrue. The claim originated from a Bulgarian politician and a satirical Telegram channel.

The evidence also indicates that foreign companies are prohibited from purchasing arable land in Ukraine. BlackRock's involvement in Ukraine is related to the Ukraine Reconstruction Fund, as announced by Larry Fink.


## Final Judgement
The claim that BlackRock has asked that Ukrainian soldiers not be buried on land it owns in Ukraine is demonstrably false. Multiple fact-checking sources have debunked the claim, citing its origin from a Bulgarian politician and a satirical Telegram channel.

CNN  — 

Putting prisoners of war in front of reporters and news cameras is almost certainly a violation of international humanitarian law.

But Ukraine clearly felt any reputational damage it might suffer by doing so in a news conference this week would be outweighed by the fact that it featured two alleged captured fighters from China.

There was more value in giving them a platform to speak, the argument presumably ran, than protecting them “against insult and public curiosity” – something the International Committee of the Red Cross says includes protection from the media.

China has always claimed neutrality in [Russia’s war on Ukraine](https://www.cnn.com/world/europe/ukraine)
 and repeatedly tells its citizens not to get involved in foreign conflicts. They had been fighting for only three days.

The role of foreign fighters
----------------------------

Foreign fighters have been a part of this war – on both sides – since the beginning.

A list seen by CNN showing non-Russian POWs held by Ukraine as of the end of 2024 showed six Sri Lankan nationals, seven from Nepal, plus individuals from Somalia, Republic of Congo, Sierra Leone, Egypt and Syria, as well as about a dozen from former Soviet republics.

In January, Ukraine also captured two North Koreans, part of an estimated force of about 14,000 troops sent by Pyongyang to help Moscow’s war effort.

A source at Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence told CNN that Russia needed its foreign fighters because it was now locked into a war of attrition.

“It is unable to maintain the long front line with its own soldiers alone and is taking every opportunity to recruit whoever it can,” the source said.

Since the announcement of the Chinese men’s capture last week – which was followed by Ukraine declaring it had information on a further 155 Chinese citizens fighting for Russia – considerable interest has focused on how they were recruited and whether China’s government had played an active role in some way.

Certainly, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky did nothing to tamp down such speculation when asked by reporters whether he thought the presence of Chinese nationals in Ukraine was the result of official Beijing policy.

“I don’t have an answer to this question yet. [](#maincontent)

CNN has seen a Russian military contract signed by a separate Chinese fighter which gives a possible indication of what the two POWs had agreed to.

The contract, which was shown to CNN by a Ukrainian intelligence source, is written in Russian. The Security Service of Ukraine will work on it,” he said last week, adding, “We are not saying that someone gave any command, we do not have such information.”

But Zelensky went on to say that Kyiv believed that Beijing was aware of what was happening.

![A man rides his bicycle past the building of the Chinese embassy in Kyiv on April 8, 2025.](https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2208587347.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill)

The POWs were at pains to indicate otherwise, both saying that they were acting as individuals, pointing to slick recruitment videos posted to TikTok as the source of their inspiration.

One such clip has been circulating on Chinese social media networks for more than a year and appears to have originally been created for a domestic Russian audience, with Chinese subtitles added later.

It shows what appear to be Russian soldiers training and dressed in combat fatigues in the field. “You’re a man, be a man,” it says in Russian, alongside Chinese subtitles, which also explain the payments on offer for signing up.

It is impossible to say if the subtitles were added by an official entity or by social media users, but one of the men said the videos resonated in China, where military prowess is highly prized, but opportunities for direct combat experience are rare.

Why the timing matters
----------------------

Though Ukraine has hosted news conferences with POWs previously, including one involving combatants from Nepal and several African countries, its decision to platform its Chinese POWs is still unusual.

The timing is important.

It comes amid Kyiv’s attempts to get the upper hand in its battle with Moscow for the ear of US President [Donald Trump](https://www.cnn.com/politics/president-donald-trump-47)
, whose administration appears to be making little headway in its efforts to convince the Kremlin to agree to a full ceasefire.

Washington has also been heavily focused on China, which some in the White House see as the United States’ main global adversary, and which the administration has been hitting with progressively larger import tariffs.

From Zelensky’s perspective, there is a clear interest in amplifying anything that suggests China’s support for Russia might be more than diplomatic and economic.

But it might not just be the US that Ukraine’s leader is sending a message to.

Anders Puck Nielsen of the Royal Danish Defence College believes Kyiv is also anxious about recent European Union overtures to China, as the two economic powerhouses look for possible joint solutions in the face of Trump’s trade wars.

“Suddenly it seems there might be potential for the Europeans and the Chinese to find common ground on other questions as well,” Nielsen told CNN.

“It has clearly been a political move to really emphasize this aspect (of Chinese fighters in the Russian army),” he added.

Beijing certainly saw it like that.

“We urge the relevant parties concerned to correctly and soberly understand the role of China and to not release irresponsible remarks,” foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian said, without mentioning names.

“When we reached a forest, my captain told me, ‘Da, da, da’ (“Yes, yes, yes” in Russian), signaling me to start the attack. Then I saw the captain of (another Russian unit) throw in a grenade, and suddenly there were (Ukrainian) drones everywhere.”

The men surrendered. The prospect of 250,000 rubles (around $3,000) per month in Russia was more than double what he could expect to earn at home.

As someone with experience in medical rehabilitation, he said he told the recruiter he wanted to do the same with the Russian military. But when he got to Moscow, he was forced into training for a combat role.

Documents were only in Russian, which neither man said they understood."

Moscow stages largest Victory Day parade since start of Ukraine war with Putin using celebrations to justify invasion

Russian troops fighting in [Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine)
 have marched with Chinese forces on Moscow’s Red Square to mark the 80th anniversary of Nazi Germany’s defeat in a Victory Day celebration marked by greater spectacle than in recent years.

After several scaled-back Victory Days – with reduced military displays and few foreign guests – [Vladimir Putin](https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin)
 on Friday addressed the largest parade since his 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

“The Soviet Union took upon itself the most ferocious, merciless blows of the enemy,” the Russian president said of the victory over Nazi Germany, before turning to his invasion of Ukraine. “For now, he is stalling for time,” he said.

Chinese troops march through Moscow’s Red Square during the Victory Day parade in on Friday. The entire country, society and people support the participants of the special military operation,” Putin said, using the Kremlin’s preferred term to describe the war.

While Putin was presiding over the parade, EU foreign ministers and Britain’s David Lammy travelled to Lviv in Ukraine where they announced the establishment of a tribunal for Russian war crimes. The Kremlin presented the turnout as proof that it is not isolated, even four years into its war in Ukraine.

Other guests included leaders from fellow autocracies and pariah regimes, such as the military juntas from Myanmar and Burkina Faso.

Putin also thanked a visiting North Korean military delegation – a sign of deepening ties and new geopolitical realities after recent [admissions from both sides](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/28/north-korea-troops-fighting-for-russia-ukraine-confirmed-kim-jong-un)
 that North Korean troops have been fighting alongside Russian forces in Ukraine.

!Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin sitting side by side <image:3185>[View image in fullscreen](#img-2)

Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin at the Victory Day parade in Moscow. “We have the chance at this historic moment to make our commercial relationship grow a lot,” he said.

This year’s parade featured an expanded military presence, with a fleet of tanks rolling across Red Square alongside rocket launchers, TOS-2 Tosochka heavy flamethrower systems and Iskander ballistic missiles – all weapons used in the war in Ukraine. But since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion, the Kremlin’s mass propaganda machine has given it new meaning, with Putin using the celebrations to justify the current war.

Seated not far from Putin were several high-profile veterans of the war in Ukraine, while Russian media reported that more than 1,500 troops who took part in the invasion participated in the march.

Putin has weaponised the legacy of the second world war to mobilise support for his invasion, falsely portraying Zelenskyy, who is Jewish, as a leader resurrecting nazism in Ukraine.

Andrei Kolesnikov, a Moscow-based political analyst, said: “Victory Day is by far the most important celebration for Putin – it’s an ideological event designed to rally the nation around him. Zelenskyy dismissed the offer as self-serving and meaningless unless it was extended to 30 days, in line with a US-backed proposal that Putin has so far rejected.

In the lead-up to Victory Day, Ukraine significantly increased its drone attacks on Moscow and surrounding regions, causing airport closures and logistical chaos.

!Russian soldiers march in columns during a parade on Victory Day <image:3188>[View image in fullscreen](#img-5)

Russian troops who were involved in the war in Ukraine march in columns during a Victory Day parade. As many observers had predicted, Kyiv appeared to refrain from targeting Moscow on the day of the parade, probably owing to the presence of high-profile international dignitaries.

Still, fighting continued near the frontlines, with Moscow accusing Ukrainian forces of attempting to breach the border in Russia’s Kursk and Belgorod regions.

This year’s parade comes at what many see as a crossroads moment for Moscow, as the Trump administration steps up its efforts to persuade Putin to end the war."

An **airliner** is a type of [airplane](/wiki/Airplane "Airplane")
 for transporting [passengers](/wiki/Passenger "Passenger")
 and [air cargo](/wiki/Air_cargo "Air cargo")
. Such aircraft are most often operated by [airlines](/wiki/Airline "Airline")
. The modern and most common variant of the airliner is a long, tube shaped, and [jet powered aircraft](/wiki/Jetliner "Jetliner")
. The largest of them are [wide-body](/wiki/Wide-body_aircraft "Wide-body aircraft")
 jets which are also called twin-aisle because they generally have two separate aisles running from the front to the back of the passenger cabin. These are usually used for [long-haul flights](/wiki/Flight_length#Short-haul_and_long-haul "Flight length")
 between [airline hubs](/wiki/Airline_hub "Airline hub")
 and major cities. A smaller, more common class of airliners is the [narrow-body](/wiki/Narrow-body_aircraft "Narrow-body aircraft")
 or single-aisle. These are generally used for short to medium-distance flights with fewer passengers than their wide-body counterparts.

[Regional airliners](/wiki/Regional_airliner "Regional airliner")
 typically seat fewer than 100 passengers and may be powered by [turbofans](/wiki/Turbofan "Turbofan")
 or [turboprops](/wiki/Turboprop "Turboprop")
. These airliners are the non-[mainline](/wiki/Mainline_(flight) "Mainline (flight)")
 counterparts to the larger aircraft operated by the major carriers, [legacy carriers](/wiki/Legacy_carrier "Legacy carrier")
, and [flag carriers](/wiki/Flag_carrier "Flag carrier")
, and are used to feed traffic into the large airline hubs. These regional routes then form the spokes of a hub-and-spoke air transport model.

The lightest aircraft are short-haul regional feeder airliner type aircraft that carry a small number of passengers are called commuter aircraft, commuterliners, feederliners, and [air taxis](/wiki/Air_taxi "Air taxi")
, depending on their size, engines, how they are marketed, region of the world, and seating configurations. The [Beechcraft 1900](/wiki/Beechcraft_1900 "Beechcraft 1900")
, for example, has only 19 seats.

### Emergence

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Emergence")\
\]

When the [Wright brothers](/wiki/Wright_brothers "Wright brothers")
 made the world's first sustained [heavier-than-air flight](/wiki/Heavier-than-air_flight "Heavier-than-air flight")
, they laid the foundation for what would become a major transport industry. Their flight, performed in the [Wright Flyer](/wiki/Wright_Flyer "Wright Flyer")
 during 1903,[\[1\]](#cite_note-NewarkDailyAdvocate_19031228-1)
 was just 11 years before what is often defined as the world's first airliner.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Tise-2)
 By the 1960s, airliners had expanded capabilities, making a significant impact on global society, economics, and politics.[\[3\]](#cite_note-Bernardo-3)

[Sikorsky Ilya Muromets](/wiki/Sikorsky_Ilya_Muromets "Sikorsky Ilya Muromets")

During 1913, [Igor Sikorsky](/wiki/Igor_Sikorsky "Igor Sikorsky")
 developed the first large multi-engine airplane, the [Russky Vityaz](/wiki/Sikorsky_Russky_Vityaz "Sikorsky Russky Vityaz")
.[\[4\]](#cite_note-4)
[\[5\]](#cite_note-5)
 This aircraft was subsequently refined into the more practical [Ilya Muromets](/wiki/Sikorsky_Ilya_Muromets "Sikorsky Ilya Muromets")
, being furnished with dual controls for a pilot and copilot and a comfortable [cabin](/wiki/Aircraft_cabin "Aircraft cabin")
 with a lavatory, cabin heating and lighting.[\[6\]](#cite_note-ASM0807-6)
 This large four-engine biplane was further adapted into an early [bomber aircraft](/wiki/Bomber_aircraft "Bomber aircraft")
, preceding subsequent transport and bomber aircraft.[\[6\]](#cite_note-ASM0807-6)
 It first flew on 10 December 1913 and took off for its first demonstration flight with 16 passengers aboard on 25 February 1914. However, it was never used as a commercial airliner due to the onset of the [First World War](/wiki/First_World_War "First World War")
 which led to military applications being prioritised.[\[7\]](#cite_note-7)
[\[8\]](#cite_note-igo40-8)

### Interwar period

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Interwar period")\
\]

In 1919, shortly after the end of the First World War, large numbers of ex-military aircraft flooded the market. One such aircraft was the French [Farman F.60 Goliath](/wiki/Farman_F.60_Goliath "Farman F.60 Goliath")
, which had originally been designed as a long-range [heavy bomber](/wiki/Heavy_bomber "Heavy bomber")
; a number were converted for commercial use into passenger airliners starting in 1919, being able to accommodate a maximum of 14 seated passengers. and around 60 were built. Initially, several publicity flights were made, including one on 8 February 1919, when the Goliath flew 12 passengers from [Toussus-le-Noble](/wiki/Toussus-le-Noble "Toussus-le-Noble")
 to [RAF Kenley](/wiki/RAF_Kenley "RAF Kenley")
, near [Croydon](/wiki/Croydon "Croydon")
, despite having no permission from the British authorities to land. Dozens of early airlines subsequently procured the type.[\[9\]](#cite_note-aeroplane1015-9)
 One high-profile flight, made on 11 August 1919, involved an F.60 flying eight passengers and a ton of supplies from Paris via [Casablanca](/wiki/Casablanca "Casablanca")
 and [Mogador](/wiki/Mogador "Mogador")
 to Koufa, 180 km (110 mi) north of [Saint-Louis, Senegal](/wiki/Saint-Louis,_Senegal "Saint-Louis, Senegal")
, flying more than 4,500 km (2,800 mi).[\[10\]](#cite_note-10)

Another important airliner built in 1919 was the [Airco DH.16](/wiki/Airco_DH.16 "Airco DH.16")
; a redesigned [Airco DH.9A](/wiki/Airco_DH.9A "Airco DH.9A")
 with a wider [fuselage](/wiki/Fuselage "Fuselage")
 to accommodate an enclosed cabin seating four passengers, plus pilot in an open cockpit. In March 1919, the prototype first flew at [Hendon Aerodrome](/wiki/Hendon_Aerodrome "Hendon Aerodrome")
. Nine aircraft were built, all but one being delivered to the nascent airline, [Aircraft Transport and Travel](/wiki/Aircraft_Transport_and_Travel "Aircraft Transport and Travel")
, which used the first aircraft for pleasure flying, and on 25 August 1919, it inaugurated the first scheduled international airline service from London to Paris.[\[11\]](#cite_note-Jackson_Civil_V2_p62-11)
 One aircraft was sold to the River Plate Aviation Company in [Argentina](/wiki/Argentina "Argentina")
, to operate a cross-river service between [Buenos Aires](/wiki/Buenos_Aires "Buenos Aires")
 and [Montevideo](/wiki/Montevideo "Montevideo")
.[\[11\]](#cite_note-Jackson_Civil_V2_p62-11)
 Meanwhile, the competing [Vickers](/wiki/Vickers "Vickers")
 converted its successful First World War era bomber, the [Vickers Vimy](/wiki/Vickers_Vimy "Vickers Vimy")
, into a civilian version, the Vimy Commercial. It was redesigned with a larger-diameter fuselage (largely of [spruce](/wiki/Spruce "Spruce")
 plywood), and first flew from the Joyce Green airfield in [Kent](/wiki/Kent "Kent")
 on 13 April 1919.[\[12\]](#cite_note-Andrews_Vickersp95-12)
[\[13\]](#cite_note-Jackson_v3_p202-13)

The world's first all-metal transport aircraft was the [Junkers F.13](/wiki/Junkers_F.13 "Junkers F.13")
, which also made its first flight in 1919.[\[14\]](#cite_note-14)
 Junkers marketed the aircraft towards business travellers and commercial operators, and European entrepreneurs bought examples for their private use and business trips. Over 300 Junkers F 13s were built between 1919 and 1932.[\[15\]](#cite_note-15)
 The Dutch [Fokker](/wiki/Fokker "Fokker")
 company produced the [Fokker F.II](/wiki/Fokker_F.II "Fokker F.II")
, then the enlarged [F.III](/wiki/Fokker_F.III "Fokker F.III")
.[\[16\]](#cite_note-Flight260521p355-16)
 These were used by the Dutch airline [KLM](/wiki/KLM "KLM")
, including on its Amsterdam-London service in 1921. A relatively reliable aircraft for the era, the Fokkers were flying to destinations across Europe, including Bremen, Brussels, Hamburg, and Paris.[\[17\]](#cite_note-deLeeuw-17)

The [Handley Page](/wiki/Handley_Page "Handley Page")
 company in Britain produced the [Handley Page Type W](/wiki/Handley_Page_Type_W "Handley Page Type W")
, its first civil transport aircraft. It housed two crew in an open [cockpit](/wiki/Cockpit "Cockpit")
 and 15 passengers in an enclosed cabin. Powered by two 450 hp (340 kW) [Napier Lion](/wiki/Napier_Lion "Napier Lion")
 engines, the prototype first flew on 4 December 1919, shortly after it was displayed at the 1919 [Paris Air Show](/wiki/Paris_Air_Show "Paris Air Show")
 at [Le Bourget](/wiki/Le_Bourget "Le Bourget")
. It was ordered by the Belgian firm [Sabena](/wiki/Sabena "Sabena")
, a further ten Type Ws were [produced under license](/wiki/Licensed_production "Licensed production")
 in Belgium by [SABCA](/wiki/SABCA "SABCA")
.[\[18\]](#cite_note-18)
 In 1921 the [Air Ministry](/wiki/Air_Ministry "Air Ministry")
 ordered three aircraft, built as the W.8b, for use by [Handley Page Transport](/wiki/Handley_Page_Transport "Handley Page Transport")
, and later by [Imperial Airways](/wiki/Imperial_Airways "Imperial Airways")
, on services to [Paris](/wiki/Paris "Paris")
 and [Brussels](/wiki/Brussels "Brussels")
.[\[19\]](#cite_note-19)

In France, the [Bleriot-SPAD S.33](/wiki/Bleriot-SPAD_S.33 "Bleriot-SPAD S.33")
 was introduced during the early 1920s.[\[20\]](#cite_note-Flight070721p460-20)
 It was commercially successful, initially serving the Paris-[London](/wiki/London "London")
 route, and later on [continental](/wiki/Europe "Europe")
 routes. The enclosed cabin could carry four passengers with an extra seat in the cockpit. It was further developed into the [Blériot-SPAD S.46](/wiki/Bl%C3%A9riot-SPAD_S.46 "Blériot-SPAD S.46")
. Throughout the 1920s, companies in Britain and France were at the forefront of the civil airliner industry.[\[21\]](#cite_note-21)

By 1921, the capacity of airliners needed to be increased to achieve more favourable economics. The English company [de Havilland](/wiki/De_Havilland "De Havilland")
, built the 10-passenger [DH.29](/wiki/De_Havilland_Doncaster "De Havilland Doncaster")
 monoplane,[\[22\]](#cite_note-Jackson_Civil_V2_pageneeded-22)
 while starting work on the design of the DH.32, an eight-seater [biplane](/wiki/Biplane "Biplane")
 with a more economical but less powerful [Rolls-Royce Eagle](/wiki/Rolls-Royce_Eagle "Rolls-Royce Eagle")
 engine.[\[23\]](#cite_note-Jackson_Civil_V3_508525-23)
 For more capacity, DH.32 development was replaced by the [DH.34](/wiki/De_Havilland_DH.34 "De Havilland DH.34")
 biplane, accommodating 10 passengers.[\[24\]](#cite_note-Flight180823-24)
 A commercially successful aircraft, [Daimler Airway](/wiki/Daimler_Airway "Daimler Airway")
 ordered a batch of nine.[\[22\]](#cite_note-Jackson_Civil_V2_pageneeded-22)

The [Ford Trimotor](/wiki/Ford_Trimotor "Ford Trimotor")
 had two engines mounted on the wings and one in the nose, and a slabsided body, it carried eight passengers and was produced from 1925 to 1933.[\[25\]](#cite_note-Herrick_2004-25)
 It was an important early airliner in America. It was used by the predecessor to [Trans World Airlines](/wiki/Trans_World_Airlines "Trans World Airlines")
, and by other airlines long after production ceased. The Trimotor helped to popularise numerous aspects of modern aviation infrastructure, including paved [runways](/wiki/Runway "Runway")
, [passenger terminals](/wiki/Airport_terminal "Airport terminal")
, [hangars](/wiki/Hangar "Hangar")
, [airmail](/wiki/Airmail "Airmail")
, and [radio navigation](/wiki/Radio_navigation "Radio navigation")
.[\[25\]](#cite_note-Herrick_2004-25)
[\[26\]](#cite_note-26)
 [Pan Am](/wiki/Pan_Am "Pan Am")
 opened up transoceanic service in the late 1920s and early 1930s, based on a series of large seaplanes – the [Sikorsky S-38](/wiki/Sikorsky_S-38 "Sikorsky S-38")
 through [Sikorsky S-42](/wiki/Sikorsky_S-42 "Sikorsky S-42")
.[\[27\]](#cite_note-Johnson-27)
[\[28\]](#cite_note-Daley,_Robert_1980,_page_103-28)

By the 1930s, the airliner industry had matured and large consolidated national airlines were established with regular international services that spanned the globe, including [Imperial Airways](/wiki/Imperial_Airways "Imperial Airways")
 in Britain, [Lufthansa](/wiki/Lufthansa "Lufthansa")
 in Germany, KLM in the Netherlands, and [United Airlines](/wiki/United_Airlines "United Airlines")
 in America. Multi-engined aircraft were now capable of transporting dozens of passengers in comfort.[\[29\]](#cite_note-29)

During the 1930s, the British [de Havilland Dragon](/wiki/De_Havilland_Dragon "De Havilland Dragon")
 emerged as a short-haul, low-capacity airliner. Its relatively simple design could carry six passengers, each with 45 lb (20 kg) of luggage, on the London-Paris route on a fuel consumption of 13 gal (49 L) per hour.[\[30\]](#cite_note-30)
 The DH.84 Dragon entered worldwide service. During early August 1934, one performed the first non-stop flight between the Canadian mainland and Britain in 30 hours 55 minutes, although the intended destination had originally been [Baghdad](/wiki/Baghdad "Baghdad")
 in [Iraq](/wiki/Iraq "Iraq")
.[\[31\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTERiding1980289-31)
[\[32\]](#cite_note-racing_p265-32)
 British production of the Dragon ended in favour of the [de Havilland Dragon Rapide](/wiki/De_Havilland_Dragon_Rapide "De Havilland Dragon Rapide")
, a faster and more comfortable successor.[\[33\]](#cite_note-moss_3-33)

By November 1934, series production of the Dragon Rapide had commenced.[\[34\]](#cite_note-moss_4-34)
 De Havilland invested into advanced features including elongated rear windows, cabin heating, thickened wing tips, and a strengthened airframe for a higher gross weight of 5,500 lb (2,500 kg).[\[35\]](#cite_note-moss_5-35)
 Later aircraft were amongst the first airliners to be fitted with [flaps](/wiki/Flap_(aeronautics) "Flap (aeronautics)")
 for improved landing performance, along with downwards-facing recognition light and metal propellers, which were often retrofitted to older aircraft.[\[36\]](#cite_note-moss_6-36)
 It was also used in military roles;[\[34\]](#cite_note-moss_4-34)
 civil Dragon Rapides were [impressed](/wiki/Impressment "Impressment")
 into military service during the [Second World War](/wiki/Second_World_War "Second World War")

The [Douglas DC-3](/wiki/Douglas_DC-3 "Douglas DC-3")
 appeared in 1935

Metal airliners came into service in the 1930s. In the United States, the [Boeing 247](/wiki/Boeing_247 "Boeing 247")
,[\[38\]](#cite_note-bhistory-38)
 and the 14-passenger [Douglas DC-2](/wiki/Douglas_DC-2 "Douglas DC-2")
,[\[39\]](#cite_note-39)
 flew during the first half of the decade, while the more powerful, faster, 21–32 passenger [Douglas DC-3](/wiki/Douglas_DC-3 "Douglas DC-3")
 first appeared in 1935. DC-3s were produced in quantity for the [Second World War](/wiki/Second_World_War "Second World War")
 and were sold as surplus afterward, becoming widespread within the commercial sector. It was one of first airliners to be profitable without the support of postal or government subsidies.[\[40\]](#cite_note-Mellberg-40)
[\[41\]](#cite_note-41)

Long-haul flights were expanded during the 1930s as Pan American Airways and Imperial Airways competed on [transatlantic travel](/wiki/Transatlantic_flight "Transatlantic flight")
 using fleets of [flying boats](/wiki/Flying_boat "Flying boat")
, such as the British [Short Empire](/wiki/Short_Empire "Short Empire")
 and the American [Boeing 314](/wiki/Boeing_314 "Boeing 314")
.[\[42\]](#cite_note-bogash-42)
 Imperial Airways' order for 28 Empire flying boats was viewed by some as a bold gamble.[\[43\]](#cite_note-norris_3-43)
 At the time, flying boats were the only practical means of building aircraft of such size and weight as land-based aircraft would have unfeasibly poor field performance.[\[43\]](#cite_note-norris_3-43)
 One Boeing 314, [registration NC18602](/wiki/Extended_flight_of_Pan_American_NC18602 "Extended flight of Pan American NC18602")
, became the first commercial plane to circumnavigate the globe during December 1941 and January 1942.[\[44\]](#cite_note-Bull-44)

The committee final report pushed four designs for the state-owned airlines [British Overseas Airways Corporation](/wiki/British_Overseas_Airways_Corporation "British Overseas Airways Corporation")
 (BOAC) and later [British European Airways](/wiki/British_European_Airways "British European Airways")
 (BEA): three piston-powered aircraft of varying sizes, and a [jet-powered](/wiki/Jet_engine "Jet engine")
 100-seat design at the request of [Geoffrey de Havilland](/wiki/Geoffrey_de_Havilland "Geoffrey de Havilland")

 conventional piston designs,[\[51\]](#cite_note-Phipp75-51)
 and the [Vickers](/wiki/Vickers "Vickers")
 model powered by newly developed [turboprops](/wiki/Turboprop "Turboprop")
: first flown in 1948, the [VC.2 Viceroy](/wiki/Vickers_Viscount "Vickers Viscount")
 was the first turboprop design to enter service;[\[52\]](#cite_note-Phipp81-52)
 a commercial success with 445 Viscounts built.[\[53\]](#cite_note-Andrews_and_Morgan,_p._537-53)
 The Type III requirement led to the conventional [Avro Tudor](/wiki/Avro_Tudor "Avro Tudor")
 and the more ambitious [Bristol Britannia](/wiki/Bristol_Britannia "Bristol Britannia")
, although both aircraft suffered protracted developments,[\[54\]](#cite_note-Barnes347-54)
 with the latter entering service with BOAC in February 1957, over seven years following its order.[\[55\]](#cite_note-Phipp105-55)

The jet-powered Type IV became the [de Havilland Comet](/wiki/De_Havilland_Comet "De Havilland Comet")
 in 1949. It featured an aerodynamically clean design with four [de Havilland Ghost](/wiki/De_Havilland_Ghost "De Havilland Ghost")
 turbojet engines buried in the wings, a pressurised fuselage, and large square windows. On 2 May 1952, the Comet took off on the world's first [jetliner](/wiki/Jetliner "Jetliner")
 flight carrying fare-paying passengers and simultaneously inaugurated scheduled service between London and Johannesburg.[\[56\]](#cite_note-bbc-56)
[\[57\]](#cite_note-cookman195207-57)
 However, roughly one year after introduction, three Comets broke up mid-flight due to airframe [metal fatigue](/wiki/Fatigue_(material) "Fatigue (material)")
, not well understood at the time.[\[58\]](#cite_note-withey_fatigue-58)
[\[59\]](#cite_note-59)
 The Comet was grounded and tested to discover the cause, while rival manufacturers heeded the lessons learned while developing their own aircraft.[\[60\]](#cite_note-60)
 The improved Comet 2 and the prototype Comet 3 culminated in the redesigned Comet 4 series which debuted in 1958 and had a productive career over 30 years, but sales never fully recovered.[\[61\]](#cite_note-Phipp93-61)
[\[62\]](#cite_note-Jackson464-62)

By the 1960s, the UK had lost the airliner market to the US due to the Comet disaster and a smaller domestic market, not regained by later designs like the [BAC 1-11](/wiki/BAC_1-11 "BAC 1-11")
, [Vickers VC10](/wiki/Vickers_VC10 "Vickers VC10")
, and [Hawker Siddeley Trident](/wiki/Hawker_Siddeley_Trident "Hawker Siddeley Trident")
. The STAC committee was formed to consider [supersonic](/wiki/Supersonic "Supersonic")
 designs and worked with Bristol to create the [Bristol 223](/wiki/Bristol_223 "Bristol 223")
, a 100-passenger transatlantic airliner. The effort was later merged with similar efforts in France to create the [Concorde](/wiki/Concorde "Concorde")
 supersonic airliner to share the cost.[\[63\]](#cite_note-Jarrett-63)

[United Airlines](/wiki/United_Airlines "United Airlines")
 [DC-6](/wiki/Douglas_DC-6 "Douglas DC-6")
, Stapleton Airport, Denver, September 1966

The first batch of the [Douglas DC-4s](/wiki/Douglas_DC-4 "Douglas DC-4")
 went to the U.S. Army and Air Forces,\[_[when?](/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers#Chronological_items "Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers")\
_\] and was named the [C-54 Skymaster](/wiki/Douglas_C-54_Skymaster "Douglas C-54 Skymaster")
. Some ex-military DC-6s were later converted into airliners, with both passenger and cargo versions flooding the market shortly after the war's end. Douglas also developed a pressurized version of the DC-4, which it designated the [Douglas DC-6](/wiki/Douglas_DC-6 "Douglas DC-6")
. Rival company Lockheed produced the [Constellation](/wiki/Lockheed_Constellation "Lockheed Constellation")
, a triple-tailed aircraft with a wider fuselage than the DC-4.

The [Boeing 377 Stratocruiser](/wiki/Boeing_377_Stratocruiser "Boeing 377 Stratocruiser")
 was based on the [C-97 Stratofreighter](/wiki/Boeing_C-97_Stratofreighter "Boeing C-97 Stratofreighter")
 military transport, it had a double deck and a pressurized fuselage.

Convair produced the [Convair 240](/wiki/Convair_CV-240_family "Convair CV-240 family")
, a 40-person pressurized airplane; 566 examples flew. Convair later developed the [Convair 340](/wiki/Convair_CV-240_family "Convair CV-240 family")
, which was slightly larger and could accommodate between 44 and 52 passengers, of which 311 were produced. The firm also commenced work on the [Convair 37](/wiki/Convair_Model_37 "Convair Model 37")
, a relatively large double-deck airliner that would have served trans[continental](/wiki/Continent "Continent")
 routes; however, the project was abandoned due to a lack of customer demand and its high development costs.\[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")\

Rival planes include the [Martin 2-0-2](/wiki/Martin_2-0-2 "Martin 2-0-2")
 and [Martin 4-0-4](/wiki/Martin_4-0-4 "Martin 4-0-4")
, but the 2-0-2 had safety concerns and was unpressurized, while the 4-0-4 only sold around 100 units.[\[63\]](#cite_note-Jarrett-63)

During the postwar years, engines became much larger and more powerful, and safety features such as deicing, navigation, and weather information were added to the planes. American planes were allegedly more comfortable and had superior flight decks than those produced in Europe.[\[63\]](#cite_note-Jarrett-63)

In 1936, the French Air Ministry requested transatlantic flying boats that could hold at least 40 passengers, leading to three [Latécoère 631s](/wiki/Lat%C3%A9co%C3%A8re_631 "Latécoère 631")
 introduced by [Air France](/wiki/Air_France "Air France")
 in July 1947.[\[65\]](#cite_note-Aeroplane0114-65)
 However, two crashed and the third was removed from service over safety concerns. The [SNCASE Languedoc](/wiki/SNCASE_Languedoc "SNCASE Languedoc")
 was the first French post-war airliner.[\[66\]](#cite_note-Aeroplane0414-66)
 Accommodating up to 44 seats, 40 aircraft were completed for Air France between October 1945 and April 1948.[\[67\]](#cite_note-67)
[\[63\]](#cite_note-Jarrett-63)
 Air France withdrew the last Languedoc from its domestic routes in 1954, being replaced by later designs.[\[66\]](#cite_note-Aeroplane0414-66)
 First flying in February 1949, the four-engined [Breguet Deux-Ponts](/wiki/Breguet_Deux-Ponts "Breguet Deux-Ponts")

A [Sud-Aviation Caravelle](/wiki/Sud-Aviation_Caravelle "Sud-Aviation Caravelle")

The [Sud-Aviation Caravelle](/wiki/Sud-Aviation_Caravelle "Sud-Aviation Caravelle")
 was developed during the late 1950s as the first short range jet airliner. The nose and cockpit layout were licensed from the [de Havilland Comet](/wiki/De_Havilland_Comet "De Havilland Comet")
, along with some fuselage elements.[\[69\]](#cite_note-López1-69)
 Entering service in mid 1959, 172 Caravelles had been sold within four years and six versions were in production by 1963.[\[70\]](#cite_note-70)
 Sud Aviation then focused its design team on a Caravelle successor.[\[69\]](#cite_note-López1-69)

The [Super-Caravelle](/wiki/Sud_Aviation_Super-Caravelle "Sud Aviation Super-Caravelle")
 was a [supersonic transport](/wiki/Supersonic_transport "Supersonic transport")
 project of similar size and range to the Caravelle. It was merged with the similar [Bristol Aeroplane Company](/wiki/Bristol_Aeroplane_Company "Bristol Aeroplane Company")
 project into the Anglo-French [Concorde](/wiki/Concorde "Concorde")
.[\[69\]](#cite_note-López1-69)
 The Concorde entered service in January 1967 as the second and last commercial [supersonic transport](/wiki/Supersonic_transport "Supersonic transport")
,[\[71\]](#cite_note-Gordon_Tu-144-71)
[\[72\]](#cite_note-Melik-Karamov_2000-72)

#### USSR

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: USSR")\

Soon after the war, most of the Soviet fleet of airliners consisted of DC-3s or [Lisunov Li-2s](/wiki/Lisunov_Li-2 "Lisunov Li-2")
. These planes were in desperate need of replacement, and in 1946, the [Ilyushin Il-12](/wiki/Ilyushin_Il-12 "Ilyushin Il-12")
 made its first flight. The Il-12 was very similar in design to American Convair 240, except was unpressurized. In 1953, the [Ilyushin Il-14](/wiki/Ilyushin_Il-14 "Ilyushin Il-14")
 made its first flight, and this version was equipped with much more powerful engines. The main contribution that the Soviets made in regards to airliners was the [Antonov An-2](/wiki/Antonov_An-2 "Antonov An-2")
. This plane is a biplane, unlike most of the other airliners, and sold more units than any other transport plane.[\[63\]](#cite_note-Jarrett-63)

Engines
-------

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Engines")\
\]

Until the beginning of the [Jet Age](/wiki/Jet_Age "Jet Age")
, [piston engines](/wiki/Piston_engine "Piston engine")
 were common on [propliners](/wiki/Propliner "Propliner")
 such as the Douglas DC-3. Nearly all modern airliners are now powered by [turbine](/wiki/Gas_turbine "Gas turbine")
 engines, either [turbofans](/wiki/Turbofan "Turbofan")
 or [turboprops](/wiki/Turboprop "Turboprop")
. Gas turbine engines operate efficiently at much higher altitudes, are more reliable than piston engines, and produce less vibration and noise. The use of a common fuel type – kerosene-based jet fuel – is another advantage.

Airliner variants
-----------------

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Airliner variants")\
\]

Some variants of airliners have been developed for carrying freight or for luxury [corporate use](/wiki/Business_jet "Business jet")
. Many airliners have also been modified for government use as [VIP](/wiki/Very_Important_Person "Very Important Person")
 transports and for military functions such as airborne tankers (for example, the [Vickers VC10](/wiki/Vickers_VC10 "Vickers VC10")
, [Lockheed L-1011](/wiki/Lockheed_L-1011 "Lockheed L-1011")
, [Boeing 707](/wiki/Boeing_707 "Boeing 707")
), air ambulance ([USAF](/wiki/United_States_Air_Force "United States Air Force")
/[USN](/wiki/United_States_Navy "United States Navy")
 [McDonnell Douglas DC-9](/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_DC-9 "McDonnell Douglas DC-9")
), [reconnaissance](/wiki/Aerial_reconnaissance "Aerial reconnaissance")
 ([Embraer ERJ 145](/wiki/Embraer_ERJ_145_family "Embraer ERJ 145 family")
, [Saab 340](/wiki/Saab_340 "Saab 340")
, and [Boeing 737](/wiki/Boeing_737 "Boeing 737")
), as well as for troop-carrying roles.

Configuration
-------------

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Configuration")\
\]

Modern jetliners are usually low-wing designs with two engines mounted underneath the [swept wings](/wiki/Swept_wing "Swept wing")
, while [turboprop](/wiki/Turboprop "Turboprop")
 aircraft are slow enough to use straight wings. Smaller airliners sometimes have their engines mounted on either side of the rear fuselage. Numerous advantages and disadvantages exist due to this arrangement.[\[74\]](#cite_note-74)
 Perhaps the most important advantage to mounting the engines under the wings is that the total aircraft weight is more evenly distributed across the wingspan, which imposes less [bending moment](/wiki/Bending_moment "Bending moment")
 on the wings and allows for a lighter wing structure. This factor becomes more important as aircraft weight increases, and no in-production airliners have both a maximum takeoff weight more than 50 tons and engines mounted on the fuselage. The [Antonov An-148](/wiki/Antonov_An-148 "Antonov An-148")
 is the only in-production jetliner with high-mounted wings (usually seen in [military transport aircraft](/wiki/Military_transport_aircraft "Military transport aircraft")
), which reduces the risk of damage from unpaved runways.

Except for a few experimental or military designs, all aircraft built to date have had all of their weight [lifted](/wiki/Lift_(force) "Lift (force)")
 off the ground by airflow across the wings. In terms of [aerodynamics](/wiki/Aerodynamics "Aerodynamics")
, the fuselage has been a mere burden. [NASA](/wiki/NASA "NASA")
 and [Boeing](/wiki/Boeing "Boeing")
 are currently developing a [blended wing body](/wiki/Blended_wing_body "Blended wing body")
 design in which the entire airframe, from wingtip to wingtip, contributes lift. This promises a significant gain in [fuel efficiency](/wiki/Fuel_efficiency_in_transportation "Fuel efficiency in transportation")
.[\[75\]](#cite_note-75)

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=21 "Edit section: Market")\
\]

Since it began, the [jet airliner](/wiki/Jet_airliner "Jet airliner")
 market had a recurring pattern of seven years of growth followed by three years of deliveries falling 30–40%, except a steady growth from 2004 due to the [economic rise of China](/wiki/Economic_history_of_China_(1949%E2%80%93present)#From_2001 "Economic history of China (1949–present)")
 going from 3% of world market in 2001 to 22% in 2015, expensive [jet fuel](/wiki/Jet_fuel "Jet fuel")
 till 2014 stimulating old jets replacement allowed by low [interest rates](/wiki/Interest_rate "Interest rate")
 since 2008, and strong [airline](/wiki/Airline "Airline")
 passenger demand since.[\[84\]](#cite_note-84)
 In 2004, 718 Airbus and Boeings were delivered, worth $39.3 billion; 1,466 are expected in 2017, worth $104.4 billion: a growth by 3.5 from 2004 to 2020 is unprecedented and highly unusual for any mature market.[\[85\]](#cite_note-85)

| Manufacturer | 2016 orders and deliveries[\[86\]](#cite_note-FGfleetwatch-86) |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| deliveries | values ($bn) | net orders | backlog |
| Boeing | 726 | 57.8 | 563 | 5,660 |

| Other | 31  | 0.5 | 72  | 1,080 |
| Total | 1,704 | 110.1 | 1,583 | 14,702 |

In 2016, the deliveries went for 38% in Asia-Pacific, 25% in Europe, 22% in North America, 7% in Middle East, 6% in South America and 2% in Africa. 1,020 narrowbodies were delivered and their backlog reach 10891: 4,991 A320neo, 644 A320ceo; 3,593 737 Max, 835 737NG, 348 CSeries, 305 C919 and 175 MC-21; while 398 widebodies were delivered : 137 Dreamliners and 99 B777 for Boeing (65%) against 63 A330 and 49 A350 for Airbus, more than 2,400 widebodies were in backlog, led by the A350 with 753 (31%) then the Boeing 787 with 694 (28%).[\[86\]](#cite_note-FGfleetwatch-86)

The most important driver of orders is airline [profitability](/wiki/Profitability "Profitability")
, itself driven mainly by world [GDP growth](/wiki/GDP_growth "GDP growth")
 but also [supply and demand](/wiki/Supply_and_demand "Supply and demand")
 balance and [oil prices](/wiki/Oil_price "Oil price")
, while new programmes by [Airbus and Boeing](/wiki/Airbus_and_Boeing "Airbus and Boeing")
 help to stimulate aircraft demand. In 2016, 38% of the 25 years old airliners had been retired, 50% of the 28 years old : there will be 523 aircraft reaching 25 years old in 2017, 1,127 in 2026 and 1,628 in 2041. Deliveries rose by 80% from 2004 to 2016, they represented 4.9% of the fleet in 2004 and 5.9% in 2016, down from 8% previously.[\[87\]](#cite_note-CAPA20June2017-87)
 Oil prices and [airshow](/wiki/Airshow "Airshow")
 orders are trending together.[\[88\]](#cite_note-88)

In 2020, deliveries were down by more than 50% compared to 2019 due to the [impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on aviation](/wiki/Impact_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic_on_aviation "Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on aviation")
, after 10 years of growth.[\[89\]](#cite_note-Flight23dec2020-89)

Main article: [Aircraft cabin](/wiki/Aircraft_cabin "Aircraft cabin")

An airliner will usually have several classes of seating: [first class](/wiki/First_class_travel "First class travel")
, [business class](/wiki/Business_class "Business class")
, and/or [economy class](/wiki/Economy_class "Economy class")
 (which may be referred to as coach class or tourist class, and sometimes has a separate "premium" economy section with more legroom and amenities). The seats in more expensive classes are wider, more comfortable, and have more amenities such as "lie flat" seats for more comfortable sleeping on long flights. Generally, the more expensive the class, the better the beverage and meal service.

Domestic flights generally have a two-class configuration, usually first or business class and coach class, although many airlines instead offer all-economy seating. International flights generally have either a two-class configuration or a three-class configuration, depending on the airline, route and aircraft type. Many airliners offer [movies or audio/video](/wiki/In-flight_entertainment "In-flight entertainment")
 on demand (this is standard in first and business class on many international flights and may be available on economy). Cabins of all classes have [lavatory](/wiki/Aircraft_lavatory "Aircraft lavatory")
 facilities, reading lights, and [air vents](/wiki/Environmental_control_system#Air_distribution "Environmental control system")
. Some larger airliners have a [rest compartment](/wiki/Crew_rest_compartment "Crew rest compartment")
 reserved for crew use during breaks.

### Seats

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=24 "Edit section: Seats")\
\]

Main article: [Airline seat](/wiki/Airline_seat "Airline seat")

The types of seats that are provided and how much legroom is given to each passenger are decisions made by the individual airlines, not the aircraft manufacturers. Seats are mounted in "tracks" on the floor of the cabin and can be moved back and forth by the maintenance staff or removed altogether. One driver of airline profitability is how many passengers can be seated in economy class cabins, meaning that airline companies have an incentive to place seats close together to fit as many passengers in as possible.[\[91\]](#cite_note-91)
 In contrast, ‘premium class’ seat configurations provide more space for travelers.[\[92\]](#cite_note-92)

Passengers seated in an **exit row** (the row of seats adjacent to an [emergency exit](/wiki/Emergency_exit "Emergency exit")
) usually have substantially more legroom than those seated in the remainder of the cabin, while the seats directly in front of the exit row may have less legroom and may not even recline (for evacuation safety reasons). However, passengers seated in an exit row may be required to assist cabin crew during an [emergency evacuation](/wiki/Emergency_evacuation "Emergency evacuation")
 of the aircraft opening the emergency exit and assisting fellow passengers to the exit. As a precaution, many airlines prohibit young people under the age of 15 from being seated in the exit row.[\[93\]](#cite_note-93)

The seats are designed to withstand strong forces so as not to break or come loose from their floor tracks during [turbulence](/wiki/Turbulence "Turbulence")
 or accidents. The backs of seats are often equipped with a fold-down tray for eating, writing, or as a place to set up a portable computer, or a music or video player. Seats without another row of seats in front of them have a tray that is either folded into the armrest or that clips into brackets on the underside of the armrests. However, seats in premium cabins generally have trays in the armrests or clip-on trays, regardless of whether there is another row of seats in front of them. Seatbacks now often feature small colour [LCD](/wiki/LCD "LCD")
 screens for videos, television and video games. Controls for this display as well as an outlet to plug in audio headsets are normally found in the armrest of each seat.

### Overhead bins

Overhead bins aboard a [Sukhoi Superjet 100](/wiki/Sukhoi_Superjet_100 "Sukhoi Superjet 100")

The overhead bins, also known as overhead lockers or pivot bins, are used for stowing carry-on baggage and other items. While the airliner manufacturer will normally specify a standard version of the product to supply, airlines can choose to have bins of differing size, shape, or color installed. Over time, overhead bins evolved out of what were originally overhead shelves that were used for little more than coat and briefcase storage. As concerns about falling debris during turbulence or in accidents increased, enclosed bins became\[_[when?](/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers#Chronological_items "Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers")\
_\] the norm. Bins have increased in size to accommodate the larger carry-on baggage passengers can bring onto the aircraft. Newer bin designs have included a handrail, useful when moving through the cabin.[\[94\]](#cite_note-94)

### Passenger service units

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=26 "Edit section: Passenger service units")\
\]

Above the passenger seats are [Passenger Service Units](/wiki/Passenger_Service_Unit "Passenger Service Unit")
 (PSU). These typically contain reading lights, air vents, and a flight attendant call light. On most narrowbody aircraft (and some [Airbus A300s](/wiki/Airbus_A300 "Airbus A300")
 and [A310s](/wiki/Airbus_A310 "Airbus A310")
), the flight attendant call button and the buttons to control the reading lights are located directly on the PSU, while on most widebody aircraft, the flight attendant call button and the reading light control buttons are usually part of the [in-flight entertainment](/wiki/In-flight_entertainment "In-flight entertainment")
 system. The units frequently have small "Fasten Seat Belt" and "No Smoking" illuminated signage and may also contain a speaker for the cabin public address system. On some newer aircraft, a "Turn off electronic devices" sign is used instead of the "No Smoking" sign, as smoking isn't permitted on board the aircraft anyway.

The PSU will also normally contain the drop-down [oxygen masks](/wiki/Oxygen_mask "Oxygen mask")
 which are activated if there is a sudden drop in cabin pressure. These are supplied with oxygen by means of a [chemical oxygen generator](/wiki/Chemical_oxygen_generator "Chemical oxygen generator")
. By using a chemical reaction rather than a connection to an oxygen tank, these devices supply breathing oxygen for long enough for the airliner to descend to thicker, more breathable air. Oxygen generators do generate considerable heat in the process. Because of this, the oxygen generators are thermally shielded and are only allowed in commercial airliners when properly installed – they are not permitted to be loaded as freight on passenger-carrying flights. [ValuJet Flight 592](/wiki/ValuJet_Flight_592 "ValuJet Flight 592")
 crashed on May 11, 1996, as a result of improperly loaded chemical oxygen generators.

### Cabin pressurization

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=27 "Edit section: Cabin pressurization")\
\]

Main article: [Cabin pressurization](/wiki/Cabin_pressurization "Cabin pressurization")

Airliners developed since the 1940s have had pressurized cabins (or, more accurately, pressurized hulls including baggage holds) to enable them to carry passengers safely at high altitudes where low oxygen levels and air pressure would otherwise cause sickness or death. High altitude flight enabled airliners to fly above most weather systems that cause turbulent or dangerous flying conditions, and also to fly faster and further as there is less drag due to the lower air density. Pressurization is applied using compressed air, in most cases bled from the engines, and is managed by an [environmental control system](/wiki/Environmental_control_system "Environmental control system")
 which draws in clean air, and vents stale air out through a valve.

Pressurization presents design and construction challenges to maintain the structural integrity and sealing of the cabin and hull and to prevent [rapid decompression](/wiki/Rapid_decompression "Rapid decompression")
. Some of the consequences include small round windows, [doors that open inwards and are larger than the door hole](/wiki/Plug_door "Plug door")
, and an [emergency oxygen system](/wiki/Emergency_oxygen_system "Emergency oxygen system")
.

To maintain a pressure in the cabin equivalent to an altitude close to sea level would, at a cruising altitude around 10,000 m (33,000 ft), create a pressure difference between inside the aircraft and outside the aircraft that would require greater hull strength and weight. Most people do not suffer ill effects up to an altitude of 1,800–2,500 m (5,900–8,200 ft), and maintaining cabin pressure at this equivalent altitude significantly reduces the pressure difference and therefore the required hull strength and weight. A side effect is that passengers experience some discomfort as the cabin pressure changes during ascent and descent to the majority of airports, which are at low altitudes.

### Cabin climate control

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=28 "Edit section: Cabin climate control")\
\]

The air bled from the engines is hot and requires cooling by [air conditioning](/wiki/Air_conditioning "Air conditioning")
 units. It is also extremely dry at cruising altitude, and this causes sore eyes, dry skin and [mucosa](/wiki/Mucosa "Mucosa")
 on long flights. Although [humidification](/wiki/Humidifier "Humidifier")
 technology could raise its [relative humidity](/wiki/Relative_humidity "Relative humidity")
 to comfortable middle levels, this is not done since humidity promotes [corrosion](/wiki/Corrosion "Corrosion")
 to the inside of the hull and risks [condensation](/wiki/Condensation "Condensation")
 which could [short](/wiki/Short_circuit "Short circuit")
 electrical systems, so for safety reasons it is deliberately kept to a low value, around 10%. Another problem of the air coming from the ventilation (unto which the oil lubrication system of the engines is hooked up) is that fumes from components in the synthetic oils can sometimes travel along, causing passengers, pilots and crew to be intoxicated. The illness it causes is called [aerotoxic syndrome](/wiki/Aerotoxic_syndrome "Aerotoxic syndrome")
.

Baggage holds

 front lower compartment. Note the rollers for [ULDs](/wiki/Unit_Load_Device "Unit Load Device")
 on the floor and the partition labeled "Caution: Do Not Hit – Potable Water Tank Inside".

Airliners must have space on board to store "checked" baggage – that which will not safely fit in the passenger cabin.

Designed to hold baggage as well as freight, these compartments are called "cargo bins", "baggage holds", "luggage holds", or occasionally "pits". Occasionally baggage holds may be referred to as **cargo decks** on the largest of aircraft. These compartments can be accessed through doors on the outside of the aircraft.

Depending on the aircraft, baggage holds are normally inside the hull and are therefore pressurized just like the passenger cabin although they may not be heated. While lighting is normally installed for use by the loading crew, typically the compartment is unlit when the door is closed.

Baggage holds on modern airliners are equipped with fire detection equipment and larger aircraft have automated or remotely activated fire-fighting devices installed.

### Narrow-body airliners

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=30 "Edit section: Narrow-body airliners")\
\]

Most "[narrow-body](/wiki/Narrow-body_aircraft "Narrow-body aircraft")
" airliners with more than 100 seats have space below the cabin floor, while smaller aircraft often have a special compartment separate from the passenger area but on the same level.

Baggage is normally stacked within the bin by hand, sorted by destination category. Netting that fits across the width of the bin is secured to limit movement of the bags. Airliners often carry items of [freight](/wiki/Freight "Freight")
 and mail. These may be loaded separately from the baggage or mixed in if they are bound for the same destination. For securing bulky items "hold down" rings are provided to tie items into place.

### Wide-body airliners

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=31 "Edit section: Wide-body airliners")\
\]

"[Wide-body](/wiki/Wide-body_aircraft "Wide-body aircraft")
" airliners frequently have a compartment like the ones described above, typically called a "bulk bin". It is normally used for late arriving luggage or bags which may have been checked at the gate.

However, most baggage and loose freight items are loaded into containers called [Unit Load Devices](/wiki/Unit_Load_Device "Unit Load Device")
 (ULDs), often referred to as "cans". ULDs come in a variety of sizes and shapes, but the most common model is the [LD3](/wiki/LD3 "LD3")
. This particular container has approximately the same height as the cargo compartment and fits across half of its width.

ULDs are loaded with baggage and are transported to the aircraft on [dolly carts](/wiki/Ground_support_equipment#Dollies "Ground support equipment")
 and loaded into the baggage hold by a loader designed for the task. By means of [belts](/wiki/Conveyor_belt "Conveyor belt")
 and [rollers](/w/index.php?title=Roller_(machine_part)&action=edit&redlink=1 "Roller (machine part) (page does not exist)")
 an operator can maneuver the ULD from the dolly cart, up to the aircraft baggage hold door, and into the aircraft. Inside the hold, the floor is also equipped with drive wheels and rollers that an operator inside can use to move the ULD properly into place. Locks in the floor are used to hold the ULD in place during flight.

For consolidated freight loads, like a pallet of boxes or an item too oddly shaped to fit into a container, flat metal pallets that resemble large baking sheets that are compatible with the loading equipment are used.

**Have you ever traveled on a jumbo jet and wondered how people might have traveled by air before its invention?**

The Museum's collection holds a variety of different airplanes which help tell the story of flight. Our collection of commercial aircraft, such as the well-known Boeing 747, help tell the history of America by air. Learn more about some of these aircraft below. 

From the Wright Brothers to Today

The Airplane's Family Tree


------------------------------

Did you know that the parts of airplanes today can be traced directly back to the Wright Flyer and the work of Orville and Wilbur Wright? In this episode of STEM in 30, we trace the family tree of the airplane from that first flight on December 17, 1903, to today—all from inside a United Airlines 76.

Airplane Anatomy


--------------------

Help Wilbur and Orville assemble the 1903 Flyer and compare it to the parts of a modern airplane. While aviation technology has developed a lot since the Wrights time, not much about the basic components of an aircraft has changed!

Early Commercial Airliners
--------------------------

The story of commercial aviation starts with air mail. Commercial airlines initially struggled to get off the ground, but with help from the government, who awarded airlines contracts to deliver the mail, they soon began to flourish. As technology improved, aircraft evolved from World War I-style biplanes into sleek, high-performance modern airliners.

### Flying the Mail

![America by Air - Curtiss JN-4D Jenny](/sites/default/files/styles/callout_half/public/images/2007-13554h.jpg?h=ed802e08&itok=tWzV7mzM)

The Curtiss JN-4D Jenny


---------------------------

Early airlines were able to turn a profit through contracts with the federal government to fly the mail. Designed as a trainer for the U.S. Army Air Service, the Curtiss JN-4 first flew in 1916. Known popularly as the "Jenny," the JN-4 taught thousands of Allied pilots to fly during World War I. After the war, surplus Jennys were widely used for "barnstorming"—traveling air shows—and they opened the first scheduled air mail service. 

The JN-4D featured a 90-horsepower Curtiss OX-5 engine. The Army ordered Curtiss to convert six JN-4Ds for the U.S. Air Mail Service by installing a larger 150-horsepower Hispano-Suiza engine and a mail compartment. These airplanes were redesignated as JN-4Hs. The Smithsonian acquired this Jenny in 1918.

### Who is Jenny?

The airplane's official name is the Curtiss JN-4. If you say the letters "JN" out loud, they sound like "Jay-En."  
That was shortened to "Jen," and it eventually was changed to "Jenny."

Of the more than 200 pilots hired by the Post Office from 1918 to 1926, 35 died flying the mail. Fatalities dropped after the first few years, but flying the mail remained a dangerous-and sometimes deadly-job.

The Post Office created a series of air mail stamps featuring the Jenny when it began flying the mail. Post Office printers made a mistake when they first printed this stamp. Today very few of these rare "upside-down Jenny" stamps still exist. These famous stamps are worth a lot of money.

De Havilland DH-4


---------------------

By 1921 modified de Havilland DH-4 light bombers were being used as mail planes. They soon become the symbol of the U.S. Air Mail Service. 

The DH-4 in the Museum's collection was the prototype American-built DH-4, manufactured by the Dayton-Wright Airplane Company. This airplane was used in more than 2,600 experiments until its retirement in April 1919. On May 13, 1918, Orville Wright made his last flight as a pilot in a 1911 Wright Model B alongside this DH-4, flown by Howard Max Rinehart. He then made a flight as a passenger in the DH-4 with Rinehart.

### Flying Passengers

Many [early airlines](https://airandspace.si.edu/stories/editorial/early-airlines-you-might-not-have-heard)
 attempted to make a profitable business from transporting passengers, but every one of these efforts failed due to high operating costs. Even after the government gave private airlines contracts to fly the mail, it was still difficult for airlines to make passenger flight profitable—resulting in [further subsidies](https://airandspace.si.edu/stories/editorial/air-mail-and-birth-commercial-aviation)
 from the federal government to encourage airlines to carry more passengers.

[![Wooden biplane-airboat model with space for two people, a passenger and the pilot. Flaglets are placed on the front structure in between the wings.](/sites/default/files/styles/body_large/public/images/14081h.jpg?itok=Zl93ospv)](/multimedia-gallery/14081hjpg)

A model of the Benoist Model XIV. The Benoist was powered by a Roberts 75-horsepower, 6-cylinder, water-cooled engine. In 1914, the trip across the bay cost $5—more than $100 today. 

### Benoist Model XIV

Many early airlines utilized flying boats for passenger service. The St. Petersburg-Tampa Airboat Line began flying across Tampa Bay on January 1, 1914. The flight covered 29 kilometers (18 miles) and took 23 minutes—11 hours less than traveling between St. Petersburg and Tampa by rail. The airline purchased a Model XIV from St. Louis aircraft manufacturer Thomas Benoist. The airplane could carry one passenger, who sat next to the pilot in the open cockpit.

Ford Tri-Motor


------------------

Affectionately known as the “Tin Goose,” the Ford Tri-Motor was the largest civil aircraft in America when it first flew on August 2, 1926. Its all-metal, corrugated aluminum construction and the prestigious Ford name made it immediately popular with passengers and airline operators. Noisy but reliable, the Ford Tri-Motor played a major role in convincing the public that air travel was safe and practical.

### Curtiss Condor 

First flown in 1932, the Curtiss Condor could carry 14 passengers and had sleeping berths for night flight. Although comfortable and fast, it was expensive to operate. Eastern Air Transport and American Airways flew the Condor, but newer designs soon replaced it.

### Boeing 40A

Powered by Pratt & Whitney's Wasp engine, the Boeing 40A could carry two passengers. Thanks to the biplane's large payload capacity and low operating costs, Boeing Air Transport won the coveted air mail route from Chicago to San Francisco in 1927 and operated the route at a profit.

Boeing developed a larger version of the aircraft, the Boeing 40B, which could carry 4,400 kilograms (2,000 pounds) of mail and four passengers. The pilot flew the airplane from an open cockpit behind the passenger compartment.

The First Modern Airliners
--------------------------

With help from the government via air mail contracts and other subsidies, commercial aviation in the United States began to take route. However, the mid-1930s were a difficult time for airlines. The federal government had broken up the large companies that had dominated the aviation industry and had cut its subsidies to airlines. Air transportation regulation was in a state of confusion. Improvements in aircraft and aviation technology played a key role in revitalizing the struggling airline industry.

To survive in these challenging times, airlines needed bigger, better, and faster airplanes that could profitably fly passengers as well as mail. New navigation and communications equipment was also required to enhance safety and efficiency. The aviation industry responded. By the late 1930s, the first modern, high-performance airliners were taking to the air.

![Image of the Boeing 247-D](/sites/default/files/styles/callout_half/public/images/image-albums/Boeing%20247-D.jpg?h=1dd3cf61&itok=wQeo249y)

Boeing 247


--------------

The government provided bonuses to airlines if their aircraft could fly at night or had multiple engines, two-way radios, and other equipment that promoted safety and speed. The first aircraft produced under these terms was the Boeing 247 in 1933, the world's first modern airliner. It could carry 10 passengers, fly 50 percent faster than the Ford Tri-Motor, and cross the country in less than 20 hours. The Boeing 247 revolutionized air transportation, featuring a sleek, low-wing, all-metal construction; retractable landing gear; and supercharged, air-cooled engines. Its innovative design launched a new generation of commercial airliners, notably the Douglas DC-2. The Boeing 247-D, the version in the Museum's collection, pioneered the use of controllable-pitch propellers and wing de-icer boots.

A model of the China Clipper. When the _China Clipper_ opened Pan Am's transpacific air mail route in 1935 and passenger service in 1936, it became one of the most famous airplanes in the world. Pan Am's other flying boats were known as the _Hawaii Clipper_ and the _Philippine Clipper_.

### China Clipper

The _China Clipper_ was the name of one of three Martin M-130 flying boats built for Pan American Airways, the United States' primary international airline during the 1930s. The Martin M-130 was the first airliner that could fly nonstop the 3,840-kilometer (2,400-mile) distance between San Francisco and Honolulu, Hawaii—the longest major route in the world without and emergency intermediate landing field. The _China Clipper_ and its sister ships demonstrated that there were no technological barriers to transoceanic travel.

Boeing 307 Stratoliner


--------------------------

The Boeing 307 Stratoliner was the world's first pressurized airliner. While other airliners flew no higher than about 3,000 meters (10,000 feet), the Stratoliner could cruise at 7,500 meters (25,000 feet). By ascending "above the weather," it could fly faster and more efficiently and provide its 33 passengers a smoother and quieter ride. Because of the onset of World War II and the development of improved designs, only 10 Stratoliners were built. The last one, Pan American's Clipper Flying Cloud, is housed in the Museum's collection.

### Four-Engine Propeller Planes

Aircraft manufacturers introduced a new generation of large, four-engine airliners after World War II that soon dominated U.S. and international air travel and helped lower fares. These new airliners were built with profitable transcontinental air routes in mind. They enabled airlines to carry far more people at greater speeds, while providing unprecedented comfort for passengers and unprecedented profits for airlines. As a result, competition increased and fares fell, thus opening up air travel to even more people.

[![Lockheed Super Constellation L-1049F](/sites/default/files/styles/body_large/public/images/4485h.jpg?itok=IR0qiF20 "Lockheed Super Constellation L-1049F")](/multimedia-gallery/4485hjpg)

The Museum's "Connie" was used by the military. It was retired in 1977 after 21½ years of military service, thousands of flying hours, and countless ocean crossings.

### Lockheed Constellation and Super Constellation

Sleek, powerful, and graceful, TWA's Lockheed Constellations introduced pressurized comfort and shortened transcontinental travel by an astounding five hours. Eastern began flying the "stretched" 71-seat Super Constellation in 1951. The L-1049C and strengthened L-1049G versions had greater range and capacity than the original "Connie." Northwest Orient and TWA also flew Super Constellations.

Douglas DC-7


----------------

The Douglas DC-7 was an advanced development of the DC-6B piston-engine airliner. It was introduced by American Airlines on its New York-Los Angeles route in November 1953 and was the first airliner to provide nonstop transcontinental service in both directions. 

The fastest transport aircraft in service, the DC-7 cruised at 580 kilometers (360 miles) per hour. A total of 338 DC-7s of all types were purchased by 18 different airlines. Like other piston-engine airliners, it was made obsolete by the introduction of turbine-engine Boeing 707s and Douglas DC-8s. Some DC-7s later served as cargo and charter planes. 

This nose section from the Museum's collection is from American Airlines' Flagship Vermont, which carried about 130,000 passengers in its nearly 13,500 hours aloft.

Jet Airliners
-------------

The jet engine revolutionized air travel. Powerful and durable, jets enabled aircraft manufacturers to build bigger, faster, and more productive airliners. Jet technology also enabled airlines to reduce their operating costs and their airfares. Jet passenger service began in the United States in the late 1950s with the introduction of Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8 airliners. 

Jet engines have far fewer moving parts than piston engines, so they are more reliable, safer, and less costly to operate. They burn kerosene, which is less expensive than gasoline, and produce tremendous thrust for their weight. As a result, jet aircraft can be made larger and can fly faster than piston-engine aircraft.

First introduced in 1948, the Rolls-Royce Dart turboprop combined the power of jet propulsion with the efficiency of propellers. It was widely used in the first generation of turboprop-powered aircraft, including the British Vickers Viscount and the Dutch Fokker F-27. The Dart enabled these and other new airliners to lower airline operating costs and bring greater speed and comfort to passengers traveling on short-to-medium length routes.

Boeing 707


--------------

On July 15, 1954, a graceful, swept-winged aircraft, bedecked in brown and yellow paint and powered by four revolutionary new engines first took to the sky above Seattle. Built by the Boeing Aircraft Company, the 367-80, better known as the Dash 80, would come to revolutionize commercial air transportation when its developed version entered service as the famous Boeing 707, America's first jet airliner.

Boeing's 707 was designed for transcontinental or one-stop transatlantic range. But modified with extra fuel tanks and more efficient turbofan engines, 707-300s could fly nonstop across the Atlantic. Boeing built 855 707s. 

_Pictured: The Museum's Boeing 367-80, or Dash 80, the prototype for the Boeing 707._

An operating, 1/4-scale model of a Pratt & Whitney JT3C (military designation J57) turbojet engine.

The Pratt & Whitney JT3 revolutionized air transportation when it entered service on the Boeing 707 in 1958. The new turbojet engine was a commercial version of the U.S. Air Force's J53, introduced in 1950. In the early 1960s, the JT3 was modified into a low-bypass turbofan-the JT3D. The first three compressor stages were replaced with two fan stages, which extended beyond the compressor casing to act like propellers. The resulting increase in airflow lowered fuel consumption, noise, and emissions. JT3Ds became widely used, especially on long-range Boeing 707-300s and Douglas DC-8s.

Boeing 747


--------------

Designed originally for Pan American to replace the 707, the giant Boeing 747 revolutionized long-distance air travel when it entered service in 1970. Carrying more than twice the passengers than the 189-seat 707, the 400-seat 747 offered dramatically lower seat-mile costs and therefore much greater efficiency. Propelled by four powerful and efficient high-bypass turbofan engines, the so-called "Jumbo Jet" spawned a new generation of wide-body airliners from Airbus, Lockheed, McDonnell Douglas, and later Boeing. 

The Boeing 747 generated great public interest because of its enormous size. Airlines offered spacious legroom, piano bars, and lounges aboard their 747s to encourage passengers to fly. These amenities quickly disappeared in the face of economic reality and were replaced by revenue-producing seats. 

First flown in 1970, the Museum's 747 was the first built for Northwest and the first 747 to open service across the Pacific. It was retired in 1999. 

[Look inside the Museum's 747](https://airandspace.si.edu/multimedia-gallery/v20170188004-panojpg)

If the entire Boeing 747 were on display, its tail would extend all the way back to the far wall of the _Boeing Milestones of Flight Hall_. Note: configuration of the Museum's galleries are subject to change.

### Varying Versions

In response to market requirements, the design of the Boeing 747 has evolved through a series of models that have greater range or capacity. The 747-400 can fly 416 passengers a range of 13,450 kilometers (8,360 miles). It features an extended upper deck and winglets. The 747-8 adds about 5.6 meters (18 feet) of fuselage and has engines derived from the Boeing 787. It can carry about 467 people a distance of 14,800 kilometers (9,200 miles). 

![Concorde at the Udvar-Hazy Center](/sites/default/files/styles/callout_half/public/images/exhibitions/hero-images/SI2005-6275_640.jpg?h=93fa4828&itok=n3pPNB1G)

Concorde


------------

The future of commercial aviation appeared to be the supersonic transport (SST), an airliner that could fly faster than sound. U.S. advocates hoped to build a larger and faster SST to compete with the British and French Concorde and the Soviet Tupolev Tu-144.  

But concerns about huge development and operational costs, high fuel consumption, drastically high fares, and sonic booms and other environmental issues proved insurmountable. U.S. airlines placed no orders for Boeing's 2707 SST, Congress withdrew support, and the project died. 

Introduced in 1976, the Concorde was the first and only operational supersonic transport. It could carry 100 passengers across the Atlantic in less than four hours, but its airfares were extremely expensive. All 14 Concordes that went into service were purchased by the British and French governments for their national airlines. Concordes stopped flying in 2003.

A Supersonic Dead End? Not so Fast.


---------------------------------------

Fifty years after the Concorde first flew, a new era of innovation and entrepreneurial ideas seeks to make supersonic flight practical and sustainable. Flying passengers at twice the speed of sound, the Concorde captured the imagination of millions, but was retired in 2003 — so what's next for supersonic flight? From reducing the sonic boom to a quiet thump to the possible pathways for supersonic to return to commercial aviation, join us for a discussion on the supersonic airliner that started it all and where we’re headed next.

**A network of Russia-based websites masquerading as local American newspapers is pumping out fake stories as part of an AI-powered operation that is increasingly targeting the US election, a BBC investigation can reveal.**

**A former Florida police officer who relocated to Moscow is one of the key figures behind it.**

The following would have been a bombshell report - if it were true.

Olena Zelenska, the first lady of Ukraine, allegedly bought a rare Bugatti Tourbillon sports car for 4.5m euros ($4.8m; £3.8m) while visiting Paris for D-Day commemorations in June. Bugatti issued a sharp denial, [calling it "fake news"](https://www.instagram.com/stories/bugatti_paris/3403151154050783240/)
, and its Paris dealership threatened legal action against the people behind the false story.

But before the truth could even get its shoes on, the lie had gone viral.

! <image:1733>!A fake version of an invoice from a Bugatti dealership, with a "FAKE" stamp on it <image:1736>

Several errors - including spelling mistakes, punctuation and the use of English - were noticed on this fake invoice. Some have been roundly ignored but others have been shared by influencers and members of the US Congress.

The story of the Bugatti hit many of the top themes of the operation – Ukrainian corruption, US aid spending, and the inner workings of French high society.

Another fake which went viral earlier this year was more directly aimed at American politics.

It was published on a website called The Houston Post – one of dozens of sites with American-sounding names which are in reality run from Moscow - and alleged that the FBI illegally wiretapped Donald Trump’s Florida resort.

It played neatly into Trump’s allegations that the legal system is unfairly stacked against him, that there is a conspiracy to thwart his campaign, and that his opponents are using dirty tricks to undermine him. On Tuesday, he denied any knowledge of the story about the Bugatti sports car.

But at other times he has bragged about his prowess in spreading fake news.

At one point he also implied that his activities are a form of revenge against American authorities.

“For me it’s a game," he said. <image:1733>!YouTube Screenshot of a YouTube video featuring false claims that Mr Zelensky bought a mansion from King Charles III <image:1748>YouTube

A YouTube video narrated by an AI-generated voice was planted as the source for the false story that Mr Zelensky bought a £20m mansion from King Charles III

Microsoft researchers also say the operation is attempting to spread stories about UK politics – with an eye on Thursday’s general election – and the Paris Olympics.

One fake story – which appeared on the website called the London Crier – claimed that Mr Zelensky bought a mansion owned by King Charles III at a bargain price.

It was seen by hundreds of thousands of users on X, and shared by an official Russian embassy account."

Content: "Car Lovers Group said the invoice is not theirs, and it contains errors that show it's fabricated, including the lack of required legal details and an incorrect price for the vehicle. 

Russian [disinformation networks](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-targets-americans-traveling-to-paris-olympics-with-fake-cia-video/)
 have spread similar false claims about Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his family in the past year, including a false claim that he bought two luxury yachts for millions of dollars, and a false claim that Zelenska bought over $1 million worth of jewelry at Cartier in New York City.

Clément Briens, a senior threat intelligence analyst for cybersecurity company Recorded Future, told CBS News that false stories about corruption are created to undermine Western support for Ukraine and "erode trust in the leaders, their institutions, and international alliances."

The falsehoods play into existing [concerns](https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2023/index/ukr)
 and documented reports about corruption in Ukraine, researchers say.

Darren Linvill, a Russian disinformation expert and professor at Clemson University in South Carolina, said the false claims are "framed for a very particular audience that wants to hear and is ready to hear that and repeat it."

Linvill said the narratives have managed to gain traction online, despite being debunked — likely because of the cost and status of the brand used by the network. Bugatti Paris — which is operated by Autofficina Parigi, a Car Lovers Group company — [said](https://www.instagram.com/p/C86tVZWKjLS/?hl=en&img_index=2)

 video that falsely claims the first lady of Ukraine, Olena Zelenska, purchased a $4.8 million Bugatti sports car has racked up millions of views on social media, CBS News has found. The video is part of a Russian disinformation campaign aimed at degrading Western support for Ukraine, researchers said. 

CBS News determined the video was [created using artificial intelligence](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-targets-americans-traveling-to-paris-olympics-with-fake-cia-video/)
. A TikTok spokesperson told CBS News their [policies](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/integrity-authenticity)
 do not allow misinformation that may cause harm and the company removes content that violates these guidelines.

While it's not clear who created the video, an early version of it [appeared](https://veritecachee.fr/2024/07/01/olena-zelenska-est-devenue-la-premiere-proprietaire-de-la-toute-nouvelle-bugatti-turbillon/?swcfpc=1)

Olena Zelenska, the wife of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in Kyiv on June 18, 2024.

London CNN  — 

A deepfake video that wrongly suggested the wife of [Ukrainian](https://www.cnn.com/world/europe/ukraine)
 President Volodymyr Zelensky purchased a luxury car during the couple’s visit to Paris last month is likely part of a Russian-linked disinformation network, according to CNN’s analysis and disinformation experts.

The AI-generated [video](https://x.com/aussiecossack/status/1807774973047758873)
 features a non-existent employee of the Bugatti dealership in Paris claiming Olena Zelenska purchased its new model, the Bugatti Tourbillon, for 4.5 million euros (around $4.8 million) on June 7.

The clip has several markings of a deep fake, from cuts in the video, to the strange accent and lip-and-mouth movements, according to Clément Briens, a researcher at cybersecurity company Recorded Future. Yet, it gathered some 18 million views in 24 hours on X, where it was reposted by pro-[Russian](https://www.cnn.com/world/europe/russia)
 influencers.

Bugatti said in a statement on Tuesday that its dealership in Paris, operated by Autofficina Parigi, a Car Lovers Group company, was victim of several criminal offenses and “firmly denounced this disinformation campaign.”

“A supposed salesman claiming to belong to the Car Lovers Group and its sports label Schumacher Group, published a video on social networks in which he indicated that the Bugatti Paris dealership sold a vehicle to the Ukrainian presidential couple,” it said, adding that the group “strongly denies both the existence of the transaction and, consequently, the existence of the invoice.”

“The mandatory legal details don’t appear on the invoice, the price of the vehicle is also wrong, the price of the options and their descriptions are inaccurate and inconsistent, the graphics are outdated, and the Car Lovers Group would never have allowed such a document to be issued,” the statement added.

The group also said it has taken legal action “by filing a criminal complaint for forgery, use of forgeries, usurpation of identity and defamation” – but did not specify against whom the complaint was filed.

Clarity, an AI cybersecurity startup that is fighting against deepfakes, told CNN that their review of the video indicated “a high certainty for AI manipulations, mostly around the middle of the face area.”

The video originates from a French-language website, Verite Cachee France (sic), whose content appears to be AI-generated by scraping French media.

A CNN analysis shows Verite Cachee was set up recently, on June 22, 2024, and some of its pages still have prompts with AI to create fake articles at the top of the piece. “Only minor change with this campaign is that the video doesn’t seem to be on YouTube.”

 [](https://tigerprints.clemson.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1002&context=mfh_reports)
from last December, Linvill and Patrick Warren, also a professor at Clemson, showed how the disinformation campaign was led by DC Weekly, a website that published a series of AI-generated Russian propaganda and fake stories, such as the debunked claim that Olena Zelenska bought $1.1 million jewellery at Cartier in New York last September.

A [report by Recorded Future](https://www.recordedfuture.com/russian-and-iranian-influence-networks-target-french-elections)
, a leading cybersecurity company, also identified Veritee Cachee as being part of the same disinformation network.

Given the size and resources of the network, it is likely some Russian support or financing is happening, Clément Briens, a senior threat intelligence analyst at the company, told CNN.

“They scrape articles automatically from a number of sources, using LLMs to introduce specifically political bias to attack Zelensky, Biden and NATO."

The BBC article includes an image of a fake invoice with a "FAKE" stamp <image:1736>. The Bugatti dealership denied the transaction.

CBS News ([https://www.cbsnews.com/news/olena-zelenska-false-claim-she-bought-bugatti/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/olena-zelenska-false-claim-she-bought-bugatti/)) also reported on the false claim, stating it was part of a Russian disinformation campaign. Bugatti Paris filed a criminal complaint against those who shared the video and forged the invoice <image:1751>. The BBC article also mentions other fake stories, including one about Zelenskyy buying a mansion from King Charles III <image:1748>.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates the claim is false. Multiple news sources, including the BBC ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c72ver6172do](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c72ver6172do)), CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/02/europe/deepfake-video-zelensky-wife-intl-latam](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/02/europe/deepfake-video-zelensky-wife-intl-latam)), and CBS News ([https://www.cbsnews.com/news/olena-zelenska-false-claim-she-bought-bugatti/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/olena-zelenska-false-claim-she-bought-bugatti/)), report that the story originated from a deepfake video and was part of a disinformation campaign. The Bugatti dealership denied the transaction and filed a criminal complaint.


## Final Judgement
The claim that Volodymyr Zelenskyy's wife bought a Bugatti in Paris is demonstrably false. Multiple reliable news sources, including the BBC, CNN, and CBS News, have reported that the story originated from a deepfake video and was part of a disinformation campaign. The Bugatti dealership denied the transaction.

In recent weeks, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has demonstrated he wants to have influence in the debate on European security, which has accelerated dramatically since Washington opened discussions with Moscow to end the conflict in Ukraine.

"We are at a crossroads in history," he warned on Sunday, March 2, at the [conclusion of the summit he chaired in London](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/03/02/eu-s-ursula-von-der-leyen-says-we-urgently-have-to-rearm-europe-after-ukraine-talks_6738734_4.html)
, which was attended by a dozen other leaders, including France's Emmanuel Macron, Italy's Giorgia Meloni, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, as well as European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

The meeting had been convened by Downing Street a week earlier, but it took on a dramatic turn following the humiliation inflicted on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky by Donald Trump and his vice president, JD Vance, in the Oval Office of the White House on Friday.

He derided the outcome of the London meeting as "a desperate attempt to pass off as success the failure of a 10-year policy of inciting Ukraine towards Russia by the same Great Britain and, until recently, the United States".

"Europe has no plan," wrote Kosachev, head of the Foreign Affairs Committee of Russia's upper house of parliament.

"And if Ukraine should count on something, it can only be on progress (if there is any to come) in Russian-American relations."

He said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who hosted the meeting, "cannot fail to understand this".

March 2, 2025

London, United Kingdom

For over three years, Ukraine has fought with extraordinary courage and resilience against Russia’s illegal, full-scale invasion. Hosted by the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Sir Keir Starmer, the Summit brought together Euro-Atlantic and NATO leaders to promote unity, reinforce collective security, and reaffirm our unwavering commitment to Ukraine in the face of Russia’s continued aggression.

During the Securing our Future Summit, the Prime Minister announced new sanctions against 10 individuals and 21 entities, including paramilitary organizations and their leaders, to help counter Russia’s reliance on third-party organizations and countries to advance its political and military objectives in Ukraine. We work closely together to advance shared priorities, including sustainable growth, rules-based international trade, gender equality, the fight against climate change, democracy and media freedom, and support for Ukraine.
*   In 2023, the United Kingdom was Canada’s third-largest destination for goods and services exports, with trade valued at $47 billion.

The information is provided for reference or research purposes. Canada remains steadfast in its support for Ukraine and its people as they continue to defend their independence.

The Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, today participated in the Securing our Future Summit in London, United Kingdom. He underscored our leadership in supporting Ukraine since the beginning of Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022, which includes almost $20 billion in multifaceted assistance ranging from military aid – such as armoured vehicles and drone technology – to humanitarian and financial assistance to help Ukraine rebuild and recover.

The Prime Minister highlighted the ongoing work of members of the Canadian Armed Forces in the United Kingdom and Poland under Operation UNIFIER. Before returning to Canada tomorrow, he will also have an audience with His Majesty King Charles III.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources discuss the 2025 London Summit on Ukraine, held on March 2, 2025, in London. The summit was initiated by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer to create a peace plan for the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Participants included leaders from 16 states, the EU, and NATO. The summit aimed to build a "coalition of the willing" to support peace negotiations and provide security guarantees for Ukraine. Key outcomes included a four-point plan and commitments from Starmer. The summit was attended by leaders including Keir Starmer, Emmanuel Macron, and Volodymyr Zelensky. Russian parliamentarians dismissed the summit, stating it produced no plan to settle the war in Ukraine.

The sources include a Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_London_Summit_on_Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_London_Summit_on_Ukraine)), an article from Le Monde ([https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/03/03/at-london-summit-starmer-defends-french-british-peace-plan-for-ukraine_6738743_4.html](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/03/03/at-london-summit-starmer-defends-french-british-peace-plan-for-ukraine_6738743_4.html)), and a Reuters article ([https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-lawmaker-says-ukraine-can-only-count-improved-moscow-washington-ties-2025-03-02/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-lawmaker-says-ukraine-can-only-count-improved-moscow-washington-ties-2025-03-02/)). <image:9> <image:1760> <image:1761>


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms the existence of the London Summit on Ukraine on March 2, 2025, attended by leaders including Zelensky, Macron, and Starmer. However, the provided sources do not mention anything about the leaders taking off their suits. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the available information.

The image search results are not included in the evidence, so it is impossible to determine if the image is authentic.

To verify the claim, information about the leaders removing their suits during the summit is needed.

Addressing the Ukrainian president, [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://www.theguardian.com/world/volodymyr-zelenskiy)
, who was sitting alongside him, Starmer added: “I hope you know that we are all with you and the people of Ukraine for as long as it takes. Nato chief says talks were ‘really positive’
    ------------------------------------------------
    
    The Nato chief, Mark Rutte, said that “more European countries will ramp up defence spending” but did not go into specifics.
    
    He described increased defence spending as “very good news” and reiterated the need for “more of a fair balance” with the US.
    
    He told reporters the first step was to make sure there is a peace deal before there are discussions about how to guarantee it.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Keir Starmer and Emmanuel Macron hold talks after the summit in London. Ukraine must be put in strongest position for future negotiations
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Starmer added another £1.6bn in UK export finance for Ukraine to “buy more than 5,000 air defence missiles, which will be made in Belfast”, on top of the £2.2bn loan he had announced on Saturday
    
    This would be vital for protecting critical infrastructure now, and strengthen Ukraine in securing the peace, when it comes, he said.
    
2. Leaders agreed to keep military aid to Ukraine flowing
    ----------------------------------------------------------
    
    Starmer said they agreed that any lasting peace must ensure Ukraine’s sovereignty and security “and Ukraine must be at the table”.
    
    He added: “In the event of peace deal we will keep boosting Ukraine’s own defensive capabilities to deter any future invasions”.
    
5. Leaders will meet again very soon
    -------------------------------------
    
    Starmer said: “We are at a crossroads in history today, this is not a moment for more talk, it’s time to act, time to step up and lead. Everyone around this table.”

Among those in attendance were the French president, Emmanuel Macron; the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, the Canadian prime minster, Justin Trudeau; the Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni; and Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission.

Here are some key takeaways:

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources discuss the London summit on Ukraine on March 2, 2025, which focused on supporting Ukraine through discussions on security, sanctions, and financial aid. The summit was attended by leaders including Justin Trudeau, Keir Starmer, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Emmanuel Macron, Olaf Scholz, and Ursula von der Leyen. The sources do not mention anything about the leaders taking off their suits.

The sources include an article from the Prime Minister of Canada ([https://www.pm.gc.ca/en/news/news-releases/2025/03/02/standing-united-in-support-of-ukraine](https://www.pm.gc.ca/en/news/news-releases/2025/03/02/standing-united-in-support-of-ukraine)) and an article from The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/02/keir-starmer-peace-talks-ukraine-key-takeaways-london-summit](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/02/keir-starmer-peace-talks-ukraine-key-takeaways-london-summit)). <image:1762>


## Elaboration
The evidence continues to provide no information about the leaders removing their suits. The search results focus on the summit's agenda and participants, but do not mention any symbolic gestures like removing suits.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that while the London Summit on Ukraine on March 2, 2025, did occur, there is no evidence in the provided sources to support the claim that European leaders took off their suits to support Ukraine. Additional searches also failed to find any mention of this action.

KYIV, March 7 (Reuters) - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's approval rating has risen by 10 percentage points since his White House spat with U.S. But in the east Zelenskiy's trust ratings were lower - at about 60%.

After last week's meeting, Trump said that Zelenskiy - whom he had already branded a "dictator" - was an obstacle to his vision of bringing peace to Ukraine.

The president said he would conduct opinion polls for trust ratings for world leaders, including Trump, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

Zelenskyy said he took Trump's comments "calmly."

"As for President Trump, with all due respect to him as a leader of the American people, who we deeply respect and are thankful for all his support, but President Trump, unfortunately, is living in this disinformation space," Zelenskyy continued.

There is currently no politician in Ukraine considered to have stronger support than Zelenskyy. and has not yet entered politics.

 concluded in Saudi Arabia, Trump suggested to reporters at Mar-a-Lago that Zelenskyy's alleged low public approval meant the country should hold a new presidential election, its 2024 contest having been postponed because Ukraine has been under martial law since Putin's invasion three years ago.

"That's not a Russia thing, that's something coming from me and coming from many other countries also," Trump said.

Trump's claims indicated that he -- like Putin -- may now be seeking Zelenskyy's removal as part of any deal to end the war.

Putin appears to see removing Zelenskyy as a key goal, both as a victory he can present to Russians and as a potential opportunity to install a pro-Russian leader in his place. <image:360>

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy gives a press conference in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Feb. The most recent, published by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) in early February, showed that 57% of respondents said they trusted Zelenskyy.

Zelenskyy's level of support is diminished from the extraordinary highs of earlier in the war. The February poll did show a 5% bump in trust from December 2024.

Still, the 50% or more regularly scored by Zelenskyy in various polls is higher than those achieved by many democratic leaders around the world.

Aides in Kyiv were quick to point out on Wednesday that Zelenskyy's recent score of 57% in the KIIS poll was higher than Trump's backing in recent U.S. That is why the Russian president is pushing for elections to be held before any final peace deal.

Zelenskyy pushed back firmly on Wednesday, fact-checking Trump and saying he was suffering from exposure to Russian disinformation.

"If someone wants to replace me right now, then right now it won't work," the president told reporters in Kyiv before a planned meeting with Trump's Ukraine-Russia envoy Keith Kellogg.

"If we are talking about 4% then we have seen this disinformation, we understand that it comes from Russia," he added. 18, 2025, in Palm Beach, Fla."

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.

* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

On December 2, anonymous Russian-language accounts on Facebook and Instagram ([1](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=541571908871528&set=a.101819279513462)
, [2](https://www.instagram.com/vizovvremenivv/p/DDE_2QJt2iJ/)
) spread information claiming that Volodymyr Zelensky purchased a hotel in Courchevel, France, for 88 million. Reports about the hotel sale have been spread by a questionable French-language media outlet, registered on November 25 of this year, while the link, which according to the report leads to the hotel’s website, is fraudulent and was created on November 22.**

Several fact-checking organizations ( [Dpa](https://dpa-factchecking.com/belgium/241203-99-214531/?fbclid=IwY2xjawG88MtleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHbkKjc7q2HviTLlnsH5KzjC2JQPi3w2sNcgRkQEHVvvYgS8-qSYNs4frmw_aem_cnqG1ln1AEcVYLnwDOBbxQ)
, [Afp](https://factuel.afp.com/doc.afp.com.36P36LD)

) have published articles on this topic. Therefore, the newly registered site under the same name is fraudulent.

[![morigi dezinphormatsia thithqos volodimir zelenskim dzviradghirebuli sastumro sheidzina3 | mythdetector.com](https://mythdetector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/morigi-dezinphormatsia-thithqos-volodimir-zelenskim-dzviradghirebuli-sastumro-sheidzina3.png "morigi dezinphormatsia thithqos volodimir zelenskim dzviradghirebuli sastumro sheidzina3 | mythdetector.com")](https://mythdetector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/morigi-dezinphormatsia-thithqos-volodimir-zelenskim-dzviradghirebuli-sastumro-sheidzina3.png)

The archived version of the fake website states that the hotel is owned by Film Heritage Inc., an offshore company that was reportedly managed by Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his wife, Olena Zelenska, until 2019. This fact has been reported by [various media outlets](https://lobservateurdemonaco.com/enquetes/hotel-de-luxe-courchevel-sbm/)
, but nowhere does it state that the hotel was resold and purchased by the Zelenskyy family.

It is worth noting that the claim that the Zelenskyy family spends Western money on personal luxuries has long been circulating and used as a Russian method to discredit Zelenskyy. *   [About Us](https://mythdetector.com/en/about-us/)

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Myth Detector fact-checks the claim that Volodymyr Zelenskyy purchased an 88 million euro hotel in Courchevel, France, stating it is false and originated from anonymous Russian-language accounts. The claim is part of a disinformation campaign to discredit Zelenskyy (<image:5661>). Ukrinform.net reports that Russian media falsely claimed Zelenskyy purchased the Palace des Neiges hotel in Courchevel, France, for 88 million euros, and that the video was fabricated, with a cloned website created (<image:5669>, <image:5671>, <image:5682>).

Inshorts reports that posts falsely claim Zelenskyy bought an 88-mn euro hotel in France, stating that Zelenskyy did not buy a luxury hotel in the French ski resort of Courchevel in October.

**Zelenskyy's visit to the White House ends abruptly after Oval Office spat** **Zelenskyy was at the White House to finalize a deal on minerals, which Trump has said is a step toward a broader peace deal he is trying to broker. But no deal was signed and the visit was cut short.

AILSA CHANG, HOST:

There was an extraordinary scene in the Oval Office today - President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy openly fighting about how to end Russia's war in Ukraine.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Your country's in big trouble.

PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY: Can I answer?

TRUMP: Wait a minute. President...

CHANG: Zelenskyy was at the White House to finalize a deal on minerals, a deal that Trump has said is a step towards the broader peace deal that he's trying to broker. And later this afternoon, Trump told reporters that he thinks Zelenskyy wants to keep fighting, that he does not want to make peace and that he feels like Zelenskky overplayed his hand today.

CHANG: Well what did President Zelenskyy have to say after all of this happened?

KHALID: Well after he left the White House, he went on to do an interview with Fox News' Bret Baier. The visit was cut short, lunch called off, a joint press conference canceled, and Zelenskyy left the White House. And, Ailsa, it is not clear when and if it will actually be signed.

The White House says Zelenskyy was told to leave. A White House official told me that Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump's national security adviser conveyed that message to the Ukrainian delegation. No, no.

ZELENSKYY: Can I answer?

TRUMP: You've done a lot of talking. You're not winning this.

ZELENSKYY: I...

TRUMP: You have a damn good chance of...

ZELENSKYY: We are staying...

TRUMP: ...Coming out OK because of us.

ZELENSKYY: Mr."

Fractures emerge quickly in meeting
-----------------------------------

From the moment Zelenskyy arrived at the White House, there were indications the meeting would be prickly.

Trump greeted Zelenskyy at the White House driveway with a handshake and a quip about his outfit, which was a black version of his usual military uniform — a symbol of his status as a wartime president.

“He’s all dressed up today,” Trump said aloud, pointing at Zelenskyy’s outfit.

As the two leaders settled into the Oval Office for their first press appearance of the day, Trump launched into his usual talking points, touting the deal to access Ukraine’s rare earth minerals.

“ We’re gonna sign the agreement at the conference in the East Room in a little, while right after lunch,” Trump said.

“ We have something that is a very fair deal, and we look forward to getting in and digging, digging, digging and working and getting some of the rare earth.”

But very quickly, it became clear the two leaders were not on the same page about the deal.

Zelenskyy emphasised that any agreement needed to include real security assurances for Ukraine, something the US under Trump has so far avoided.

“I hope that this document, first document will be first step to real security guarantees for Ukraine,” the Ukrainian president said. ![JD Vance, Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy sit in the Oval Office](/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AP25059667476448-1740778890.jpg?resize=730%2C410&quality=80)

A high-profile meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his United States counterpart Donald Trump has devolved into a shouting match, as the two leaders clashed over the future of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

On Friday, Zelenskyy [arrived at the White House](/news/liveblog/2025/2/28/donald-trump-live-news-zelenskyy-in-dc-for-talks-on-rare-minerals-deal)
 to discuss a proposed deal to give the US access to Ukraine’s rare earth minerals, while pushing for US security assurances.

But as the two leaders sat down for a news conference in the Oval Office, the atmosphere quickly curdled, with Trump shouting at Zelenskyy, telling him to be “thankful” for US support.

“You’re either going to make a deal or we’re out,” Trump told Zelenskyy.

Shortly after the close of the meeting, Trump released a statement on social media, seeming to withdraw the US from negotiations with Ukraine and eject Zelenskyy from the White House. “He had to go through that.”

Accusations of ‘disrespect’
---------------------------

The Trump team repeated well-worn accusations that the administration of his predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden, was responsible for allowing the war in Ukraine to start in the first place.

As tensions started to skyrocket, US Vice President JD Vance took a swing against Biden, accusing him of  ”thumping \[his\] chest” to end the war. “Our people, our children, are really counting it.”

A clash over relations with Putin
---------------------------------

Trump also quickly touted his ongoing negotiations with Putin, saying that they had “very good discussions” together and would bring the war to a close.

The US president had previously said that it was “unlikely” that Ukraine would return to its pre-2014 borders, before Russia started to seize territories like Crimea and Donetsk. And soon after, Zelenskyy was spotted exiting the White House in a dark vehicle, as a line of representatives from the Ukrainian delegation walked out of the building.

The war of words soon shifted to the internet, where each leader offered remarks on what transpired in the Oval Office.

“Much was learned that could never be understood without conversation under such fire and pressure,” Trump [wrote](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114082877976878390)
 on his platform, Truth Social. “ I’ve empowered you to be a tough guy, and I don’t think you’d be a tough guy without the United States.”

Within minutes, the meeting was at an end.

An uncertain future
-------------------

No deal on rare earth minerals was signed that afternoon. No deal was ultimately signed.

“I have determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for Peace if America is involved,” Trump wrote. He can come back when he is ready for Peace.”

For more than a decade, Ukraine has faced territorial incursions from Russia, culminating in a full-scale invasion that began in February 2022.

The international community has largely denounced Russia’s actions as illegal, and the US has been a pivotal partner in Ukraine’s defence, committing [$65.9bn](https://www.defense.gov/Spotlights/Support-for-Ukraine/Timeline/)
 in military assistance since the start of the war three years ago.

But that support has come into doubt since Trump took office in January. Earlier this month, Trump spoke directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin and sent US envoys to negotiate a peace deal with Russian officials in Saudi Arabia, without Ukrainian or European participation.

Zelenskyy and other European leaders have denounced those proceedings as sidelining their interests.

Trump has since ratcheted up tensions, calling Zelenskyy a “dictator” for not holding wartime elections and accusing him of taking advantage of the US “gravy train”.

Zelenskyy was the third European leader to visit Trump this week, after French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. And on Friday, Zelenskyy emphasised that Trump’s support would be “crucial” to maintaining Ukraine’s territorial integrity.

“I really count on your strong position to stop Putin,” Zelenskyy said."

Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the President of Ukraine, faced criticism from Donald Trump and JD Vance during a tense White House meeting. While Brian Glenn, Chief White House Correspondent at Real America’s Voice, donning a blue suit himself, tried to ‘embarrass’ Zelenskyy by asking him whether he owned a suit or not, the Ukranian president gave it back to him by saying, "I will wear a (suit) costume after this war finishes, yes. 

Who is Volodymyr Zelenskyy? 

------------------------------

  
Volodymyr Oleksandrovych Zelenskyy is a Ukrainian politician and former entertainer who has served as the sixth and current president of Ukraine since 2019, most notably during the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, which has been ongoing since February 2022. 
As per Forbes’ estimate, Zelensky’s entire real estate portfolio is worth $4 million, including two more wholly owned apartments, two that he co-owned, a single commercial property, and five parking spaces. 'Fight On Your Own...'

  
Meanwhile, on Monday, President Donald Trump ordered a 'pause' on US military aid to Ukraine after a tense Oval Office meeting, aiming to push Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy into peace negotiations with Russia. Zelenskyy, known for his calm demeanor despite the confrontation, ultimately left without securing a crucial minerals deal. The Ukrainian president was at the White House for a meeting with US President [Donald Trump](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/donald-trump)
, which ended in an ‘unprecedented disaster’ after Trump, along with his VP, JD Vance, engaged in a ‘shouting match’ all the while ‘berating’ Zelenskyy. 
First, it was about Zelenskyy’s outfit (he wore a black sweater – the same color and cut he has donned every time he’s appeared in droopy military fatigues) that was questioned by an American reporter."

Key Findings

*   Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his partners in comedy production owned a network of offshore companies related to their business based in the British Virgin Islands, Cyprus, and Belize.
*   Zelensky’s current chief aide, Serhiy Shefir, as well as the head of the country’s Security Service, were part of the offshore network.
*   Offshore companies were used by Shefir and another business partner to buy pricey London real estate.
*   Around the time of his 2019 election, Zelensky handed his shares in a key offshore company over to Shefir, but the two appear to have made an arrangement for Zelensky’s family to continue receiving money from the offshore.

##### Suspect in Kenya's Anglo Leasing Scandal Used Offshore Secrecy to Obscure Ties to Companies](https://www.occrp.org/en/project/the-pandora-papers/global-shell-game-helped-hide-companies-linked-to-huge-kenyan-scandal)

Leaked documents from the Pandora Papers reveal that Sri Lankan-Irish businessman Anura Perera, named by the Kenyan Anti-Corruption Commission as a suspect in the Anglo Leasing procurement scandal, was the owner, director or signatory of at least six offshore firms implicated in the case. In general offshore companies are bad, whether they’re owned by a president or not,” Ryaboshapka said.

He called moving money offshore “an old tradition” in Ukraine, because the country was perceived as a dangerous place with “no rule of law.” But still, the use of such companies today raises red flags of “tax evasion or the legalization of dirty money,” he said.

“That’s the essence of offshore companies.”

Actor Volodymyr Zelensky stormed to the Ukrainian presidency in 2019 on a wave of public anger against the country’s political class, including previous leaders who used secret companies to stash their wealth overseas.

Now, leaked documents prove that Zelensky and his inner circle have had their own network of offshore companies. The show starred Zelensky as a humble history teacher whose anti-corruption rant in class is filmed by a student, goes viral online, and wins him national office.

In a case of life imitating art, Zelensky ended up winning the real-world Ukrainian presidency just three-and-a-half years after the show’s launch, with more than 73 percent of the vote.

Zelensky capitalized on widespread public anger at corruption, but his 2019 campaign was dogged by doubts over his anti-graft bona fides, given that his campaign was boosted by media belonging to Kolomoisky — who is [accused of stealing US$5.5 billion](https://www.occrp.org/en/investigations/oligarchs-weaponized-cyprus-eranch-of-ukraines-largest-bank-to-send-5-billion-abroad)
 from his own bank and funneling it offshore in concert with his partner, Hennadiy Boholiubov.

In the heat of the campaign, a political ally of incumbent President Petro Poroshenko published a chart on Facebook purporting to show that Zelensky and his television production partners were beneficiaries of a web of offshore firms that allegedly received $41 million in funds from Kolomoisky’s Privatbank.

That ally, Volodymyr Ariev, didn’t provide evidence, and his accusations have never been proven. But the Pandora Papers show that at least some of the details in this alleged scheme correspond to reality. / Alamy Stock Photo\

Serhiy Shefir (right) and Volodymyr Zelensky (left) at Zelensky’s presidential campaign headquarters in 2019.

Serhiy Shefir’s brother Borys, who is a part-owner of Maltex Multicapital Corp, said he may indeed be an owner, but was unaware of the details of the offshore arrangement, which was largely the work of Ukraine’s now-Security Service chief, Bakanov.

“Bakanov was our financial director, he set up the financial schemes of our company. Zelensky has not mentioned Maltex in any of his public asset declarations, including one filed for 2018, when he still owned 25 percent of the company.

In such an arrangement, “the real owner has placed another person to act as his or her proxy to pretend to be the shareholder,” Woods said.

“The person making the transfer wants to retain the shares and the benefit of the shares, but doesn’t want other people to know that that is the situation."

In response to questions sent by Pandora Papers reporters, Fidelity confirmed it was the registered agent for Maltex Multicapital Corp, but it said that Zelensky was not currently an owner or beneficiary of any company under its administration.

“The present Ukrainian president is not our client, nor does he have any ownership or any other position in any entity under our administration,” Fidelity said.

The company also argued that there would have been nothing wrong to have worked for Zelensky prior to his ascent to political office in 2019. The chart showed money flowing from the bank via a series of apparent shell entities to companies alleged to have been owned by Zelensky and associates.

Ariev has not provided documentation to back up his claims.

However, the Pandora Papers documents do provide the first corroboration for elements of his allegation: that 10 of the companies that allegedly received the money really did belong to Zelensky and his partners. The financial flows that are visible from the documents appear to be connected to their television production business, of which Kolomoisky was a client.

The leaked documents show the offshore network was set up by individuals behind Kvartal 95 in 2012, the same year in which local media reported that Kvartal 95 entered into a production deal with Kolomoisky’s 1+1 Group.

The Pandora Papers show that SVT Films Ltd, a company that was as of May 2013 half-owned by the BVI holding company Maltex, was to be paid $1.2 million in licensing fees by January 2013 by an offshore company linked to Kolomoisky’s 1+1 network for the television program “Make a Comedian Laugh.”

In 2015, a company called Gimentiano Holdings Ltd, which was ultimately owned by Zelensky’s friend Andriy Iakovlev, also received $750,000 into its account at the Cyprus branch of Kolomoisky’s Privatbank."

On February 20, during the broadcast of “New Paradigm,” host Tengo Omanadze spoke about the increase in President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s wealth during the Russia-Ukraine war \[[52:40](https://www.facebook.com/100064835944683/videos/1031699295465330)\
\]. According to Zelenskyy’s financial declarations, his income decreased after the war began, and his family’s financial situation was affected by the temporary suspension of rental income from real estate. Moreover, according to Forbes and Bloomberg, Ivanishvili’s wealth has increased compared to the beginning of the war.**

*   #### **Did Zelenskyy’s Income Increase or Decrease After the War Began?**
    

Before entering politics, Volodymyr Zelenskyy was a successful actor and producer, accumulating his wealth while working in the entertainment industry before becoming president. Thus, the increase in Zelenskyy’s family income compared to the previous year was linked to the resumption of rental payments.

Regarding savings, financial declarations show that the family’s cash reserves have gradually decreased. By the end of 2022, their savings had dropped by approximately 1.8 million hryvnias, and by the end of 2023, they had [decreased](https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-publishes-declaration-unveiling-more-than-317-000-of-income-for-his-family-in-2023/)
 by another 2.8 million hryvnias (about $71,000).

It is notable that Zelenskyy’s financial situation has not changed significantly since becoming president. According to the latest available Forbes data from 2022, his net worth is [less](https://www.logicallyfacts.com/en/fact-check/false-ukraine-president-volodymyr-zelenskyy-s-net-worth-is-over-500-million?u)
 than $30 million. While this is a substantial amount, it is not surprising in the case of Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as he was a successful actor and producer.

The real estate owned by Zelenskyy and his family has remained practically unchanged during his presidency. Myth Detector has published multiple reports debunking such claims:

*   #### **How Did Ivanishvili’s Wealth Change During the Russia-Ukraine War?**
    

[According](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/profiles/bidzina-ivanishvili/)
 to Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index, Bidzina Ivanishvili’s wealth is estimated at $7.60 billion \[March 5, 2025\], ranking him 406th on the list."

Thanks for signing up.

Thank you for signing up. Some news sources speculate that tweets declaring the former comedian’s net worth at $1.5 billion were efforts to undermine support for Zelenskyy and Ukraine.

### So how much is Zelenskyy really worth?

According to Celebrity Net Worth, Zelenskyy is worth roughly $1.5 million — not $1.5 billion. At the time, that gave him a net worth of $1.5 million USD, although, due to foreign exchange rates, the amount fluctuates.

Zelenskyy earned most of his money as a Ukrainian entertainer, starring in Russian-language films including “Love in the Big City,” “Office Romance,” and “8 First Dates.” The tri-lingual president, who is fluent in Russian, Ukrainian, and English, also dubbed the Ukrainian voiceovers for “Paddington”and “Paddington 2.”

From 2015 to 2019, he starred in a political satire comedy series, “Servant of the People.” The oddly prophetic show, which aired for 51 episodes, chronicled the adventures of a high school teacher turned president of Ukraine. In 2019, Zelenskyy ran for office and was elected as president.

Although this marked Zelenskyy’s first foray into politics, he does have the education to back up his recent career change."

The claim is demonstrably false.

These sources indicate that Zelenskyy owns fewer than 15 properties, does not own private planes, and has a significantly lower income and net worth than stated.

The Times of India ([https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/etimes/trending/net-worth-of-volodymyr-zelenskyy-the-entertainer-turned-president-of-ukraine/articleshow/118651819.cms](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/etimes/trending/net-worth-of-volodymyr-zelenskyy-the-entertainer-turned-president-of-ukraine/articleshow/118651819.cms)) estimates Zelenskyy's real estate portfolio to be worth $4 million, which is far less than the $35 million home in Florida mentioned in the claim. Furthermore, the Pandora Papers investigation ([https://www.occrp.org/en/project/the-pandora-papers/pandora-papers-reveal-offshore-holdings-of-ukrainian-president-and-his-inner-circle](https://www.occrp.org/en/project/the-pandora-papers/pandora-papers-reveal-offshore-holdings-of-ukrainian-president-and-his-inner-circle)) revealed offshore holdings, but the claim's specific figures for bank accounts and income are not supported by the evidence.

----------- So they’re in the process of setting it up and we’re going to see what happens.”

Trump’s reluctance to push Putin and Zelenskyy to a meeting comes as he has acknowledged in recent days that ending the war in Ukraine has been more difficult than he had anticipated, after [saying on the campaign trail](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/25/politics/fact-check-trump-ukraine-war)
 last year he could achieve it in 24 hours.

He has since sought a quick peace agreement after his deadline for Russia to end the war expired this month and said after his [meetings with Zelenskyy and European leaders](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/18/trump-zelenskyy-meeting-ukraine-putin)
 at the White House on Monday that he had initiated steps for a bilateral meeting.

A senior administration official characterized the situation as Trump taking a “wait-and-see approach” to whether a Putin-Zelenskyy meeting could be scheduled. Putin’s foreign policy aide, Yuri Ushakov, later said the two leaders agreed that more senior negotiators would be appointed for direct talks between Russia and [Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine)
.

That statement signaled that a bilateral meeting could remain some way off, even as the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, expressed optimism it could happen within two weeks and Putin has rejected previous attempts by Zelenskyy to meet face-to-face since the start of the war.

At a news conference on Monday night after the White House meetings, Zelenskyy said that the European leaders’ meeting with Trump centered on security guarantees for Ukraine in any peace agreement to ensure Russia did not resume its invasion.

Trump offered to contribute to security guarantees, but has since [ruled out deploying US troops](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/19/european-leaders-ukraine-russia-trump)

Trump steps back from Russia and Ukraine peace talks for now, sources say
=========================================================================

US president told top advisers trilateral meeting would take place after leaders of the two countries have met first

[Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump)
 intends to leave Russia and Ukraine to organize a meeting between their leaders without directly playing a role for now, according to administration officials familiar with the situation, taking a step back from the negotiations to end Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

The next stage in Trump’s eyes to end the war in Ukraine remains a bilateral meeting between Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, and [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://www.theguardian.com/world/volodymyr-zelenskiy)
, the Ukrainian president, the officials said.

Trump has told advisers in recent days that he intends to host a trilateral meeting with the two leaders only after they have met first, although whether that initial conference takes place remains unclear and Trump does not intend to become involved in that effort.

In a phone interview with talk show host Mark Levin on WABC on Tuesday, Trump also said he thought it would be better for Putin and Zelenskyy to meet without him in the first instance. But there have been few tangible signs in recent days of progress and the White House does not have a shortlist of locations where the meeting could take place.

In a statement, the White House said: “Trump and his national security team continue to engage with Russian and Ukranian officials towards a bilateral meeting to stop the killing and end the war… It is not in the national interest to further negotiate these issues publicly.”

After the meetings at the White House, Trump spoke to Putin on a call that lasted around 40 minutes. Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, has also suggested that Russia should be one of the security guarantors for Ukraine – a proposal the White House has privately scoffed at, one official said.

“The Ukrainian side proposed, and our delegation at that time agreed, to work out security guarantees that would involve all permanent members of the UN security council – that is, Russia, the People’s Republic of China, the United States, France, and the United Kingdom,” Lavrov said.

After the White House meetings, Zelenskyy also outlined a plan to purchase $90bn in American weapons through Europe to win security guarantees, and for the US to buy drones from Ukraine. [Skip to main content](#maincontent)

Trump and Zelenskyy at the White House on Monday, 18 August 2025, in Washington. Any US assistance is expected to come in the form of intelligence sharing or possibly US air support.

Previously, Steve Witkoff, Trump’s special envoy, had said on CNN’s “state of the union” after the Trump-Putin summit in Alaska that Putin agreed the US could offer Ukraine a security guarantee that resembled Nato’s Article 5 collective self-defense mandate.

“We were able to win the following concession: that the United States could offer Article 5-like protection, which is one of the real reasons why Ukraine wants to be in Nato,” Witkoff said.

But Putin’s acceptance of Nato-like security guarantees may not be as straightforward."

Ukraine's president [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy "Volodymyr Zelenskyy")
, Foreign Minister [Dmytro Kuleba](/wiki/Dmytro_Kuleba "Dmytro Kuleba")
, and Head of the Presidential Office, [Andriy Yermak](/wiki/Andriy_Yermak "Andriy Yermak")

Ukrainian president [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy "Volodymyr Zelenskyy")
 proposed in November 2022 a 10-point peace plan,[\[26\]](#cite_note-kp10point-26)
[\[27\]](#cite_note-ajz1-27)
[\[28\]](#cite_note-28)
 consisting of:

*   A ceasefire and withdrawal of Russian military forces from Ukraine
*   Restoration of Ukraine's borders prior to the 2014 annexation of Crimea
*   Release of prisoners and return of [Ukrainian children deported to Russia](/wiki/Child_abductions_in_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War "Child abductions in the Russo-Ukrainian War")
    
*   Protection and restoration of [Ukraine's energy infrastructure](/wiki/Russian_strikes_against_Ukrainian_infrastructure_(2022%E2%80%93present) "Russian strikes against Ukrainian infrastructure (2022–present)")
    
*   Protection of [food distribution](/wiki/2022%E2%80%932023_food_crises#Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine "2022–2023 food crises")
    
*   Nuclear safety, including transfer of [Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant](/wiki/Zaporizhzhia_Nuclear_Power_Plant_crisis "Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant crisis")
     to the [IAEA](/wiki/International_Atomic_Energy_Agency "International Atomic Energy Agency")
    
*   Environmental safety, including [demining](/wiki/Demining "Demining")
     and remediation of ecological damage caused by the [destruction of the Kakhovka Dam](/wiki/Destruction_of_the_Kakhovka_Dam "Destruction of the Kakhovka Dam")
    
*   Prosecution of [Russian war crimes](/wiki/War_crimes_in_the_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine "War crimes in the Russian invasion of Ukraine")
    
*   Security guarantees for Ukraine to prevent future aggression
*   A multilateral peace conference and peace treaty

Two months before the invasion, Ukrainian Foreign Minister [Dmytro Kuleba](/wiki/Dmytro_Kuleba "Dmytro Kuleba")
 dismissed the idea that declaring [neutrality](/wiki/Neutral_country "Neutral country")
 would prevent Russian aggression. The agreement was however blocked by Putin, who "expanded his objectives to include annexing swathes of Ukrainian territory".[\[21\]](#cite_note-Reuters14092022-21)
 A Kremlin spokesman denied the story.[\[47\]](#cite_note-moscowtimes-deal-47)

### Belarus and Antalya peace talks

Ukrainian president [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy "Volodymyr Zelenskyy")
 and Belarusian president [Alexander Lukashenko](/wiki/Alexander_Lukashenko "Alexander Lukashenko")
 agreed on 27 February that a Ukrainian delegation would meet with Russian officials in Belarus, near the Ukrainian border, without preconditions.[\[48\]](#cite_note-48)
 It was reported that Lukashenko assured Zelenskyy that all planes, helicopters, and missiles on Belarusian territory would remain on the ground during the negotiations.[\[49\]](#cite_note-49)

Talks began on 28 February at one of Lukashenko's countryside residences near Liaskavičy, about 30 miles from the [Belarus-Ukraine border](/wiki/Belarus-Ukraine_border "Belarus-Ukraine border")
.[\[42\]](#cite_note-ForeignAffairs_CharapRadchenko2024-42)
 The Ukrainian delegation was led by [Davyd Arakhamia](/wiki/Davyd_Arakhamia "Davyd Arakhamia")
 and included defense minister [Oleksii Reznikov](/wiki/Oleksii_Reznikov "Oleksii Reznikov")
, presidential adviser [Mykhailo Podolyak](/wiki/Mykhailo_Podolyak "Mykhailo Podolyak")
, and others. The Ukrainians wanted a peacetime army of 250,000; the Russians demanded a maximum of 85,000, which is much smaller than the standing army Ukraine had before the invasion.[\[42\]](#cite_note-ForeignAffairs_CharapRadchenko2024-42)
 The Russians also demanded severe limits on the amount and kinds of weaponry Ukraine could have, without any limits on Russia's military.[\[42\]](#cite_note-ForeignAffairs_CharapRadchenko2024-42)

A third disagreement was the Russians' new demands for Ukraine to revoke several of its domestic laws, dealing with [contentious aspects of Soviet-era history](/wiki/Decolonization_in_Ukraine "Decolonization in Ukraine")
, such as the role of Ukrainian nationalists in World War II. Secretary of State [Antony Blinken](/wiki/Antony_Blinken "Antony Blinken")
 insisted that Ukraine continue fighting in response to Milley's statement.[\[128\]](#cite_note-128)
 Ukraine presented the detailed [10-point peace proposal](/wiki/Ukraine%27s_Peace_Formula "Ukraine's Peace Formula")
 later in November at a [G20](/wiki/G20 "G20")
 meeting.[\[129\]](#cite_note-AJE_Zelenskyy_10pt_plan-129)
 In December, Ukrainian foreign minister [Dmytro Kuleba](/wiki/Dmytro_Kuleba "Dmytro Kuleba")
 suggested a February 2023 peace summit at the UN mediated by secretary-general [António Guterres](/wiki/Ant%C3%B3nio_Guterres "António Guterres")
 to which Russia would only be invited if it faced an international court for war crimes.[\[130\]](#cite_note-ap221226-130)
 Later that month, Russian officials said it would only resume peace talks with Ukraine if it recognized Russian sovereignty over the annexed regions.[\[22\]](#cite_note-voa221230-22)
[\[131\]](#cite_note-131)
 Peskov said in January 2023 that "there is currently no prospect for diplomatic means of settling the situation around Ukraine."[\[132\]](#cite_note-132)

In February 2023, at the [59th Munich Security Conference](/wiki/59th_Munich_Security_Conference "59th Munich Security Conference")
, Chinese foreign policy chief [Wang Yi](/wiki/Wang_Yi "Wang Yi")
 said Chinese leader [Xi Jinping](/wiki/Xi_Jinping "Xi Jinping")
 would present a peace proposal for the war in Ukraine.[\[133\]](#cite_note-133)
[\[134\]](#cite_note-134)
 On 24 February, China's government published a 12-point paper of "[China's Position on the Political Settlement of the Ukraine Crisis](/wiki/China%27s_Position_on_the_Political_Settlement_of_the_Ukrainian_Crisis "China's Position on the Political Settlement of the Ukrainian Crisis")
", receiving mixed responses from Western leaders.[\[135\]](#cite_note-135)
[\[136\]](#cite_note-136)
[\[137\]](#cite_note-137)
 At the [UN General Assembly](/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly "United Nations General Assembly")
, China's deputy ambassador to the UN proposed a plan involving a ceasefire, dialogue, security guarantees for Russia, protection of civilians, and the upholding of territorial integrity; China also said that the West had exacerbated the conflict by supplying Ukraine with weaponry.[\[138\]](#cite_note-138)
[\[139\]](#cite_note-139)
 Zelenskyy said that "I plan to meet Xi Jinping and believe this will be beneficial for our countries and for security in the world", though a time or place for a meeting was not set.[\[140\]](#cite_note-140)
 The spokeswoman of Russia's foreign ministry, [Maria Zakharova](/wiki/Maria_Zakharova "Maria Zakharova")
, said Russia appreciated China's efforts to resolve the conflict and was "open to achieving the goals of the [special military operation](/wiki/Special_military_operation "Special military operation")
 by political and diplomatic means" but that it would entail recognising the "new territorial realities" of Russia's annexations.[\[141\]](#cite_note-141)
 Peskov said that for now, we don't see any of the conditions that are needed to bring this whole story towards peace."[\[142\]](#cite_note-chinese-peskov-142)

 with Putin during Xi's [2023 visit to Russia](/wiki/2023_visit_by_Xi_Jinping_to_Russia "2023 visit by Xi Jinping to Russia")

Chinese foreign minister [Qin Gang](/wiki/Qin_Gang "Qin Gang")
 said sanctions and political pressure would not resolve the conflict, which he said "seems to be driven by an invisible hand pushing for the protraction and escalation", and that "the process of peace talks should begin as soon as possible".[\[143\]](#cite_note-143)
 Xi said that China's peace proposal reflected world opinion ahead of [his visit to Russia on 20–22 March 2023](/wiki/2023_visit_by_Xi_Jinping_to_Russia "2023 visit by Xi Jinping to Russia")
.[\[144\]](#cite_note-144)
 Blinken responded by saying "the world should not be fooled by any tactical move by Russia, supported by China or any other country, to freeze the war on its own terms."[\[145\]](#cite_note-guardian230321-145)
 On 26 April 2023, over a month after Xi's summit with Putin, Xi Jinping held a phone call with Zelenskyy.[\[146\]](#cite_note-146)
 The Chinese readout of the Xi–Zelenskyy call included little concrete information about the start of a peace process;[\[147\]](#cite_note-147)
 in May, European officials criticized China's peace plan as an attempt at "freezing" the conflict in place and splitting the West in pushing Ukraine to a ceasefire.[\[148\]](#cite_note-wsj230526-148)
 Earlier, Peskov had said that Russia has "to achieve our goals" and that "Right now this is only possible by military means."[\[149\]](#cite_note-149)

In April 2023, some Ukrainian officials said they would be willing to discuss the status of Crimea.[\[150\]](#cite_note-150)
[\[151\]](#cite_note-foreignpol230411-151)
 That month, Brazilian president [Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva](/wiki/Luiz_In%C3%A1cio_Lula_da_Silva "Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva")
 suggested that Ukraine should "give up Crimea" in exchange for Russian withdrawal from all territory it has occupied since February 2022.[\[152\]](#cite_note-:15-152)
 Lula condemned Russia's violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity but said that Zelenskyy "cannot want everything";[\[152\]](#cite_note-:15-152)
[\[153\]](#cite_note-153)
 he said Brazil advocates a "negotiated political solution to the conflict" and expressed concern over "global consequences" of the war "in terms of [food](/wiki/2022%E2%80%932023_global_food_crises "2022–2023 global food crises")
 and energy security".[\[154\]](#cite_note-aljazeera-brazil-154)
 Brazilian foreign policy adviser [Celso Amorim](/wiki/Celso_Amorim "Celso Amorim")
 said "the ideal peace for the Ukrainians and the Russians" required "concessions".[\[154\]](#cite_note-aljazeera-brazil-154)
 Ukraine rejected Lula's proposal.[\[155\]](#cite_note-155)
 Lula said after visiting China that "the United States needs to stop encouraging war and start talking about peace", to which U.S. Petersburg, Russian president Vladimir Putin rejected a ceasefire and peace talks with Ukraine due to the ongoing [Ukrainian counter-offensive](/wiki/2023_Ukrainian_counteroffensive "2023 Ukrainian counteroffensive")
 against Russian forces in [Russia-occupied](/wiki/Russian-occupied_territories_of_Ukraine "Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine")
 southeastern Ukraine, saying "We cannot cease fire when we are under attack."[\[180\]](#cite_note-180)

 focusing on Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy's proposed peace plan.[\[181\]](#cite_note-SAsummit286936-181)
[\[182\]](#cite_note-182)
 Russia did not participate in the talks.[\[181\]](#cite_note-SAsummit286936-181)
 Prior to the summit [Andriy Yermak](/wiki/Andriy_Yermak "Andriy Yermak")
, Zelenskyy's chief of staff, said there would be discussions on the Ukrainian Peace Formula, which "contains 10 fundamental points, the implementation of which will not only ensure peace for Ukraine, but also create mechanisms to counter future conflicts in the world".[\[183\]](#cite_note-183)
 After the summit no joint statement was issued.[\[181\]](#cite_note-SAsummit286936-181)
 The participants did agree to create working groups to develop details of key themes prominent in Zelenskyy's proposed peace plan (that calls for Russian troops to withdraw from all of Ukraine's territory as part of a peace deal) while a parallel ambassadors group would continue technical work on the issues.[\[181\]](#cite_note-SAsummit286936-181)

On 27 September 2023, Russian Foreign Minister [Sergey Lavrov](/wiki/Sergey_Lavrov "Sergey Lavrov")
 said in an interview with [TASS](/wiki/TASS "TASS")
 that Russia was "ready to make agreements" on Ukraine if they would "take the situation on the ground" and Russian security interests into account.[\[184\]](#cite_note-Lav1681505-184)
 According to Lavrov one of the Russian security interest was "the need to prevent the creation of a hostile Nazi regime near Russian borders."[\[184\]](#cite_note-Lav1681505-184)
 Lavrov also said that Russia did not see "any serious proposals from the West" and he argued that they were promoting [Ukrainian president](/wiki/Ukrainian_president "Ukrainian president")
 Volodymyr Zelenskyy ['peace formula'](#September_2022)
 as "the sole basis for negotiations" and that there was "no point in discussing it as it is nothing but an ultimatum."[\[184\]](#cite_note-Lav1681505-184)
 Lavrov also praised the [June 2023 African](#June_2023)

, [Brazilian](#April_2023)

[Slovakia](/wiki/Slovakia "Slovakia")

 said that sending more and more [weapons to Ukraine](/wiki/List_of_military_aid_to_Ukraine_during_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War "List of military aid to Ukraine during the Russo-Ukrainian War")
 has only encouraged more killings and endless war, and instead efforts should be made to reach a cease-fire and push Russia and Ukraine toward peace talks. Both countries reportedly planned to send delegations to talks mediated by Qatari officials, but Russian officials postponed the meeting after Ukraine's offensive.[\[234\]](#cite_note-washingtonpost-qatar-234)
 Ukrainian officials told _[The Washington Post](/wiki/The_Washington_Post "The Washington Post")

 Some officials had hoped the talks could be the first step toward a comprehensive peace deal.[\[234\]](#cite_note-washingtonpost-qatar-234)
 Putin said one week after the Kursk offensive began that he would not negotiate with Ukraine.[\[235\]](#cite_note-euractiv-qatar-235)

In September 2024, Zelenskyy proposed U.S. Many of these resources remain unexploited, while some deposits are located in territories occupied by Russia.[\[237\]](#cite_note-Abdurasulov_202502263-237)
 The next month, Zelenskyy unveiled the [Victory Plan for Ukraine](/wiki/Victory_Plan_for_Ukraine "Victory Plan for Ukraine")
,[\[238\]](#cite_note-238)
 which sought to solve to the conflict with Russia and describe future national defense guarantees.[\[239\]](#cite_note-239)
 The plan's official goal is "to change the circumstances in such a way that Russia will be forced to peace".[\[240\]](#cite_note-240)
 It outlined strategies to strengthen Ukraine and potentially end the war, including a renewed request for inclusion in NATO and a robust post-war security framework, assistance in deterring Russian aggression, and a "special agreement on joint investment and use" of Ukraine's natural resources—such as uranium, titanium, and lithium—with the [European Union](/wiki/European_Union "European Union")

US President [Donald Trump](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/trump-ukraine-russia-zelensky-putin-08-19-25)
 has ditched his call for a ceasefire in Ukraine, backing instead Russian President Vladimir Putin’s push for a permanent peace agreement. And my response to that is: That’s the point,” Pizzi said.

Ad Feedback But they understand that the kind of deal sought by Russia can’t happen unless the most basic principle underpinning the global order – that a country cannot get what it wants by force – is thrown under the bus.

And Kyiv’s European allies are not willing to risk that, not least because they could well become the next target of Russia’s aggression.

Speaking to the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and several European leaders in the Oval Office on Monday, Trump adopted some of Moscow’s talking points, questioning whether a ceasefire was “necessary” if a broader peace deal could be achieved.

But international law experts and analysts say that any deal that would force Ukraine to give up its land to stop the killing of its people by Russia would be completely illegal under the UN Charter, a key international agreement which most countries signed up to after the horrors of the Second World War.

While often thought of as essentially the same thing, there is a big difference between a peace deal and a ceasefire in the eyes of international law.

During a ceasefire, warring parties agree to stop fighting with each side keeping hold of the territory under its military control. So what that also (means) is that any treaty that you procure by use of force is effectively illegal and is inherently void,” said Jeremy Pizzi, an international lawyer and a legal adviser of Global Rights Compliance, a human rights foundation.

Little detail has been shared about the kind of peace deal Putin discussed with Trump last week, but it is clear that the Russian leader has not abandoned some of his maximalist demands, including that Ukraine give up the entire eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, known as the Donbas, and is banned from joining NATO in the future.

This would make the deal doubly illegal under international law: illegal because of the way it would be reached – by force – and illegal because of its content.

But even if he wanted to – which he does not – Zelensky cannot agree to give up territory.

Under the Ukrainian constitution, any change to the country’s borders must be approved by a referendum – a rule that is in place partly because of Russia’s tendency to install puppet governments in foreign countries.

And, crucially, even if Kyiv were to recognize that the reality on the ground gives Russia the de-facto control of some of its land, it would certainly not agree to make this a permanent recognition. That has not stopped some [European leaders](https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-ukraine-zelensky-russia-putin-08-18-25)
 from pushing for a temporary truce first, even though the US president has seemingly decided one is not necessary.

It’s not that [Kyiv](https://www.cnn.com/world/europe/ukraine)
 and its allies don’t want peace. But the understanding is that the pause is temporary – usually to provide a window to negotiate, deliver humanitarian help or evacuate civilians.

Kyiv and its European allies suggested that a ceasefire might be a precursor for a meeting between Zelensky and Putin, followed by a trilateral meeting between Trump, Zelensky, and Putin.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who attended the summit on Monday, said that he “can’t imagine that the next meeting will take place without a ceasefire.”

A ceasefire can be short – like the 1914 Christmas Truce that lasted a few days – or it could stretch to decades. The prohibition of using armed force to conquer territory is absolute under international law,” Pizzi said.

No ‘sensible reason to trust Russia’
------------------------------------

There are also practical and strategic reasons why Ukraine cannot agree to Moscow’s demands.

The Russian military currently controls almost all of Luhansk and more than 70% of Donetsk, which means that Putin is asking Kyiv to give up even more than it has lost so far.

But the parts of the Donbas region that are still under Kyiv’s control include infrastructure that is crucial for Ukraine’s defense. If they were to be taken by Russia, the road to the western parts of the country would be wide open.

There is also little incentive for Kyiv to trust Moscow, Pizzi said.

“Russia has engaged in armed attacks against Ukraine for over 10 years now, consistently, repeatedly during that time. Russia has feigned negotiations, feigned good faith, while continuing to use violence and keeping up the same illegal maximalist goals in the background and Ukrainian authorities are painfully aware of this,” he said.

“There is no logical, sensible reason to trust Russia in the absence of a precursor, a good faith decision or engagement that they make on their part to hold off from killing more Ukrainians,” he added.

Kyiv, backed by the Europeans, has indicated that it is willing to recognize the current reality on the ground in order to stop the killing."

A timeline of territorial shifts during Russia’s war on Ukraine
===============================================================

[World](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world)
 Aug 18, 2025 2:27 PM EDT

Russia’s troops are continuing their slow war of attrition in eastern and northern Ukraine, even as the conflict enters a pivotal phase with a series of high-level meetings that are part of U.S. House of Representatives approves $61 billion package for Ukraine after months of delay.

May 10, 2024 — Russia launches a new offensive in the northeastern region of Kharkiv, capturing a string of villages and opening a new front in the war.

Aug. His election raises uncertainty as to whether Washington will continue to support Ukraine.

April 26, 2025 — Moscow says all Ukrainian troops have been forced out from Russia’s Kursk region. Several weeks later, Putin visits the area in a show of strength and is filmed speaking with local volunteers.

June 1, 2025 — Ukraine strikes airfields deep inside Russia by launching drones that have been secretly stored and transported across the country on the back of trucks. The attack is codenamed Operation Spider Web.

Summer 2025 — Russia and Ukraine both step up drone strikes with the ability to strike deep into each other’s territory.

June 30, 2025 — Russia says it has taken full control of Ukraine’s Luhansk, one of four regions that Moscow illegally annexed in September 2022. 24, 2022 — Russian President Vladimir Putin launches an invasion of Ukraine from the north, east and south. Russian troops quickly reach Kyiv’s outskirts, but their attempts to capture the capital and other cities in the northeast meet stiff resistance.

March 5, 2022 — Russian advances toward Kyiv and Kherson reach their height. The port city of Mariupol is surrounded.

April 2, 2022 — Ukraine defeats Russian forces in Kyiv after throwing them back in Chernihiv.

Aug. 30, 2022 — Russia illegally annexes Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions of Ukraine, even though it doesn’t fully control either of the four.

September to November 2022 — Ukrainian forces reclaim vast parts of the Kharkiv, Mykolaiv and Kherson regions in the first counteroffensive, including the city of Kherson itself.

May 22, 2023 — Russia claims control of Bakhmut after months of fighting.

June 6, 2023 — As Ukraine’s long-anticipated second counteroffensive starts, the Russian-controlled Kakhovka Dam explodes, sending a wall of water into southern Ukraine and upending Ukrainian battle plans.

Fall 2023 — The second Ukrainian counteroffensive ends, with little change to the front line.

Feb. 6, 2024 — Ukraine launches a lightning incursion into Russia’s Kursk region, holding territory along the border in an unexpected and embarrassing episode for the Kremlin.

**August 24, 2025, 8:15 pm ET** 

**Click** [**here**](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/36a7f6a6f5a9448496de641cf64bd375)
 **to see ISW’s interactive map of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Lavrov's continued insistence that any end to the war must address Russia's "root causes," including multiple times following the August 15 Alaska summit, continues to indicate that Russia's war aims have not changed.\[7\]

**Lavrov continued efforts to mischaracterize Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as the impediment to an enduring peace in Ukraine, in order to distract from the Kremlin's own unwillingness to compromise or engage in negotiations on US President Donald Trump's proposed timeline.** Lavrov claimed that Zelensky "will not resolve the \[Kremlin's\] issue\[s\]" with Ukraine and accused Zelensky of publicly stating that "he is not going to discuss any territories," deliberately mischaracterizing Zelensky's recent public statements to the opposite.\[8\] Zelensky has repeatedly indicated in recent days that he is willing to discuss territorial issues in a bilateral meeting with Putin.\[9\] Lavrov claimed that Zelensky is going against Trump's wishes regarding NATO membership and is refusing to repeal laws relating to Russia's defined "root causes" of the war. Geolocated footage published on August 24 shows an explosion and fire near the refinery.\[25\] Samara Oblast Governor Vyacheslav Fedorishchev claimed on August 24 that Ukrainian drones struck an unspecified "industrial enterprise" in Syzran City.\[26\] ISW recently observed reports from Russian business outlet _Kommersant_ indicating that Ukrainian long-range strikes campaign targeting Russian oil refineries are among the factors impacting Russia's fuel reserves and threatening oil revenues.\[27\] The Kremlin relies on oil revenues to fund its war in Ukraine, and Ukrainian long-range strikes continue to threaten Russia’s economic stability.

**Ukraine's Western partners continue to provide military aid to Ukraine, including through the purchase of US weapons.** Two US officials told the _Wall Street Journal_ (WSJ) on August 24 that the United States approved the sale of 3,350 Extended Range Attack Munition (ERAM) air-launched missiles to Ukraine and reported that the systems will arrive in Ukraine in six weeks (about mid-October 2025).\[28\] The WSJ reported that the ERAMs are part of a mostly European-funded arms package for Ukraine that includes other air defense systems and Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (GMLRS). Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney stated that more than C$1 billion (about $722 million) of the C$2 billion (around $1.44 billion) worth of military aid that Canada pledged to Ukraine in June 2025 will go toward the delivery of armored vehicles, drones, and ammunition that will arrive in Ukraine as early as September 2025.\[30\]

**Ukraine and Russia conducted another prisoner exchange that included a limited number of Ukrainian journalists and government officials on August 24.** The Ukrainian Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War (POWs) and the Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) reported that Ukraine and Russia each exchanged 146 POWs.\[31\] Russia also released three civilians, two journalists, and former Kherson City Mayor Volodymyr Mykolayenko, and Ukraine also released eight Kursk Oblast residents. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) mediated the exchange.

**Key Takeaways:**

*   **Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov used an English-language interview with a US outlet to reiterate the Kremlin's explicit rejection of US-proposed initiatives for peace in Ukraine.**
*   **Lavrov continued efforts to mischaracterize Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as the impediment to an enduring peace in Ukraine, in order to distract from the Kremlin's own unwillingness to compromise or engage in negotiations on US President Donald Trump's proposed timeline.**
*   **Lavrov denied that Russia violated past international treaties prohibiting Russia from invading Ukraine and rejected Western-backed security guarantees for Ukraine in the future.**
*   **Ukrainian forces struck Russian energy infrastructure in Leningrad and Samara oblasts on the night of August 23 to 24.**
*   **Ukraine's Western partners continue to provide military aid to Ukraine, including through the purchase of US weapons.**
*   **Ukraine and Russia conducted another prisoner exchange that included a limited number of Ukrainian journalists and government officials on August 24.**
*   **Ukrainian forces recently advanced near Pokrovsk, and Russian forces recently advanced in northern Kharkiv Oblast.**

[Ukraine](/topic/ukraine) ISW will cover subsequent reports in the August 25 Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment.**

**Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov used an English-language interview with a US outlet to reiterate the Kremlin's explicit rejection of US-proposed initiatives for peace in Ukraine.** Lavrov stated in an interview with NBC that Russian officials have explained Russia's war goals during meetings with Trump and other US officials and have also explained them publicly, signaling that public Russian statements about the war convey the same points that Russian officials aim to convey in private meetings.\[1\] Lavrov reiterated that Russia views NATO expansion and the alleged "violation of Russian security interests" as one of the "root causes" of the war.\[2\] Lavrov claimed that Russia will achieve its war aims, which he listed as the removal of security threats to Russia "coming from the Ukrainian territory," the protection of the rights of the "ethnic Russian and Russian-speaking people who believe they belong to the Russian culture and Russian history," and Ukrainian neutrality. Lavrov claimed that Ukraine has the right to exist but only as long as it "lets go" of ethnic Russians and Russian speakers who "decided that they belong to Russian culture."\[3\] Lavrov claimed that Russia has a "duty" to support and protect those who share the values of the Russian language and the "Russian World" ("Russkiy Mir").\[4\] Lavrov's statements in the NBC interview reiterate consistent Kremlin claims that the alleged "root causes" of the war are NATO's eastward expansion and Ukraine's discrimination against Russian speakers.\[5\] The Kremlin's "root causes" notably extend beyond Ukraine, and agreeing to Russia's demand that any future peace settlement "eliminate" the root causes would require substantial negotiations with NATO as well.\[6\] Lavrov is also promoting the narrative that Ukraine is part of the Kremlin's "Russkiy Mir" idea - an amorphous ideological and geographic conception that Russia claims includes all of the former territories of Kyivan Rus, the Kingdom of Muscovy, the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union, and the contemporary Russian Federation. Lavrov asked why Zelensky is "ready to meet" and implied that any Zelensky-Putin meeting would be useless, suggesting that Putin is unwilling to meet with Zelensky unless Ukraine concedes to Russia's original war demands, which amount to Ukraine's military, political, and cultural capitulation.\[10\]

Lavrov also undermined Zelensky's legitimacy as part of efforts to justify Russia's refusal to engage in the peace process and to sign a peace deal with Ukraine. The Budapest Memorandum does state that Russia, the UK, and the United States are committed to not use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, such as Ukraine.\[14\] Lavrov's claims ignore, however, that the memorandum also states that Russia, the UK, and United States are committed to "respect the independence and sovereignty and the existing borders of Ukraine."

Lavrov claimed that Western states, which Lavrov alleged prepared a "coup" in Ukraine in 2014 (in reference to Ukraine's democratically organized Revolution of Dignity) and support a "Nazi" government in Kyiv (in reference to Ukraine's democratically elected government), should not be allowed to be responsible for Ukraine's post-war security – a rejection of the US- and European-backed security guarantees for Ukraine currently under discussion.\[15\] Lavrov claimed that he never stated that Russia must have a veto over security guarantees for Ukraine but that there should be a consensus on such guarantees and take into account Russia's interests."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Guardian published an article on August 21, 2025, discussing Donald Trump's involvement in negotiations to end the war between Russia and Ukraine, including a meeting with Zelenskyy on August 18, 2025, and potential security guarantees for Ukraine (<image:4898>). Wikipedia mentions a timeline of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, including January 2025 – May 2025 and June 2025 – present, and that Trump began pushing for peace negotiations in December 2024, after winning the U.S. presidential election, and also links to a "2025 Putin–Trump call". CNN published an article on August 19, 2025, discussing the difference between a ceasefire and a peace deal in the context of the war between Ukraine and Russia (<image:1>, <image:2>, <image:3>, <image:4>, <image:5>).

The articles are available at: [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/21/trump-ukraine-russia-peace-talks](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/21/trump-ukraine-russia-peace-talks), [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_negotiations_in_the_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_negotiations_in_the_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine), and [https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/19/europe/ukraine-ceasefire-peace-deal-difference-analysis-latam-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/19/europe/ukraine-ceasefire-peace-deal-difference-analysis-latam-intl).


### Evidence from `web_search`
A timeline of the Russian invasion of Ukraine from January 1 to May 31, 2025, details various attacks and military actions, including drone strikes, airstrikes, and territorial shifts. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine_(1_January_2025_%E2%80%93_31_May_2025](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine_(1_January_2025_%E2%80%93_31_May_2025))

PBS News published a timeline of territorial shifts during Russia’s war on Ukraine on August 18, 2025, which includes events from 2022 to 2025. ([https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/a-timeline-of-territorial-shifts-during-russias-war-on-ukraine](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/a-timeline-of-territorial-shifts-during-russias-war-on-ukraine)) The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) published an assessment on August 24, 2025, discussing the ongoing war, including Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov's rejection of US-proposed peace initiatives and continued military aid to Ukraine. ([https://understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-august-24-2025](https://understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-august-24-2025)) <image:9607> <image:9608>


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that while peace negotiations were underway in 2025, a peace deal had not been reached in early 2025. The Guardian and CNN articles from August 2025 discuss ongoing negotiations and the distinction between a ceasefire and a peace deal. Furthermore, the Institute for the Study of War's assessment from August 24, 2025, indicates that the war was still ongoing, with Russia rejecting peace initiatives. The timeline of the Russian invasion of Ukraine also details military actions through May 2025.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that peace negotiations were ongoing in 2025, but a peace deal had not been reached in early 2025. Multiple sources, including The Guardian, CNN, and the Institute for the Study of War, confirm that the war was still ongoing and that negotiations were in progress.

`false`

WATCH: Harris meets with Ukraine’s Zelenskyy as Russia makes nuclear warning
============================================================================

[World](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world)
 Sep 26, 2024 6:51 PM EDT

WASHINGTON (AP) — With American support for Ukraine at a partisan crossroads, Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday slammed suggestions that Kyiv should cede territory for the sake of peace with Moscow as “dangerous and unacceptable.”

The Democratic presidential nominee spoke alongside Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as she unleashed the veiled criticism of Republican candidate Donald Trump’s push for Ukraine to quickly cut a deal to end the war.

**Watch Harris and Zelenskyy’s remarks in the player above.**

“They are not proposals for peace,” Harris said. “Where Trump goes off course, and where Biden and Harris have a much stronger argument, is that we get to that point not by throwing Ukraine under the bus but by giving them sufficient support so they can block further Russian aggression.”

_Associated Press writers Aamer Madhani and Michelle Price in New York and Ellen Knickmeyer, Lisa Mascaro, Mary Clare Jalonick, Kevin Freking, Steven Groves and Amelia Thomson-Deveaux in Washington contributed to this report._

 [Chris Megerian, Associated Press](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/author/chris-megerian-associated-press) assistance for Ukraine, praised Russian President Vladimir Putin and faulted Zelenskyy for the ongoing bloodshed.

[**WATCH:** Trump suggests Ukraine should have made concessions to Putin before Russian invasion during N.C. He rejected Harris’ criticisms and insisted that he only wants to stop the “horror show that’s gone on.”

Asked if Ukraine should give up territory, Trump said “we’ll see what happens” and “we need peace.”

Before announcing the meeting with Zelenskyy, Trump posted on social media a purported message from the Ukrainian leader asking to see him. The message, which was not confirmed by Ukrainian officials, said “we have to strive to understand each other.”

The decision to publicly disclose what appeared to be private communications, however benign their contents, was a reminder of the tension that’s been brewing between Trump and Zelenskyy.

It was a far different impression than Harris delivered on Thursday as she embraced Ukraine’s defense and outlined a broader foreign policy vision rooted in “international order, rules and norms.” Harris rejected calls for the U.S. to walk away from its global role and warned that potential aggressors could be emboldened if Putin emerges victorious.

“The United States supports Ukraine not out of charity, but because it’s in our strategic interest,” Harris said.

Zelenskyy was in Washington to present the White House and Congress with his plans for reaching an endgame in the war by improving Ukraine’s chances on the battlefield and its eventual leverage at the negotiating table. has a responsibility to help Ukraine, compared with one third of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, according to a Pew Research Center poll conducted in July.

Americans are also split on which presidential candidate would do a better job handling the war. [An AP-NORC poll from August](https://apnorc.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AP-NORC-August-2024-President-Topline.pdf)
 found that about one-third of Americans said they trusted Harris more, while a similar share said the same about Trump.

On Thursday, Zelenskyy found some bipartisan support as he visited Capitol Hill, where he was greeted by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.

Sen. Jim Himes, another Connecticut Democrat and the ranking member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said Zelenskyy wanted “more, faster.”

“He was politely frustrated,” Himes said, and specifically requested more Patriot missile defenses as Russia escalates strikes on Ukraine’s cities and energy grid before the winter.

Zelenskyy faces a much more tense situation with Trump. However, he said, Trump risks undermining Ukraine by enabling Putin to make more gains on the battlefield.

“Neither Ukraine nor Russia is going to win this war, and the sooner that the parties try to end this, the better,” Kupchan said. He’s pushing to lift restrictions on using long-range Western weapons to strike targets deeper in Russian territory.

No movement on this issue was evident during Zelenskyy’s visit."

Ukraine and its war with Russia have become a central and controversial topic in the 2024 U.S. During the presidential debate with Harris in September, Trump declined to reveal whether he wanted Ukraine to win its war with Russia when he was asked, instead responding, “I want the war to stop,” and urging the two countries to negotiate a deal.

“What I’ll do is I’ll speak to one, I’ll speak to the other, I’ll get them together,” Trump [said](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/harris-trump-russia-ukraine-2024/)
. Trump and Zelenskyy had a phone call in July, which the former president described as a “very good phone call.” He [wrote](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-he-had-very-good-call-with-ukraines-zelenskiy-friday-2024-07-19/)
 in a social media post after that call that when he is president, Ukraine and Russia “will be able to come together and negotiate a deal that ends the violence and paves a path forward to prosperity.” He has suggested that lifting the sanctions against Russia will be part of this deal.

Trump has criticized the Biden administration for sending billions of dollars in aid to Ukraine. A Harris administration might well continue Biden’s policy of providing Ukraine with enough support so that it does not lose, but not with the wherewithal to win and eject Russia from Ukrainian territory.

**What is the outlook?**
------------------------

On the face of it, it appears that a future Harris administration’s policy toward Russia and Ukraine would represent continuity with that of the Biden administration. The brutal conflict, in which a [million people](https://www.wsj.com/world/one-million-are-now-dead-or-injured-in-the-russia-ukraine-war-b09d04e5)
 have been killed or severely injured, shows no signs of ending. President Joe Biden has said that [Ukraine must prevail](https://www.reuters.com/world/biden-says-putin-will-not-prevail-war-with-ukraine-2024-09-13/)
 in this war and that Russia will not win. Donald Trump, who claims the war would not have broken out had he been president in 2022, says he [could end it 24 hours](https://apnews.com/article/trump-russia-ukraine-war-un-election-a78ecb843af452b8dda1d52d137ca893)
 after being elected, before his inauguration.

The issue for the American voter is whether the United States should continue to support Ukraine for as long as it takes (as the White House now says) or whether it should pressure Ukraine to negotiate with Russia and end the war without having regained its full territorial integrity. national interest to pour so much money into supporting Ukraine and favor a rapid end to the conflict.

**Trump’s policies toward Russia and Ukraine during his presidency**
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Both Russia and Ukraine featured prominently during Trump’s first presidency, as I have [written](https://cup.columbia.edu/book/chaos-reconsidered/9780231556262)
 elsewhere."

"Even if you’ve never stepped foot in a church — God’s gospel is the same for all people, and it’s the only thing that has the power to transform the human heart, our communities and the world," said Rev. Franklin Graham joins 'Cavuto Live' to discuss the importance of religion and provides his Easter message amid global tensions.

**FIRST ON FOX:** [Easter Sunday](https://www.foxnews.com/category/faith-values/lent-and-life)
, and the hope that the resurrection of Jesus Christ offers, is the solution to the world's major ills, Rev. Franklin Graham told Fox News Digital in exclusive comments ahead of the most significant holiday in Christianity.

"As we approach Easter, the need for Jesus Christ is so evident in the world around us," said Graham via email. 

He shared his thoughts just ahead of the airing of his Easter message from Israel, which will be shown on Easter Sunday on Fox News Channel at 12 noon ET. It's part of Fox News' special coverage of the Easter holiday across its programs. 

[**REV. Franklin Graham.  (Billy Graham Evangelistic Association)

People who are facing loneliness "and a basic lack of hope" turn to destructive relationships, substances and other things to attempt to fill a void in their lives, said Graham.

"That never works," he said. 

> "It's about God sending His Son to die on a cross to pay the penalty for your sins and my sins — the penalty of death, paid in full."

What does work, however, is embracing the miracle that occurred on the first Easter Sunday two millennia ago, said the distinguished faith leader: the resurrection of [Jesus Christ](https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/religion/christianity)
 three days after his death on the cross. 

"It's about God sending His Son to die on a cross to pay the penalty for your sins and my sins — the penalty of death, paid in full — so that we can experience forgiveness, new life, and hope that only comes through a personal relationship with Him." 

Easter, he said, is a celebration of [Christ's victory](https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/religion)
 over sin and death.

With his upcoming Easter message from Israel, Graham "wants to share the Good News, which is the Gospel, with as many people as I can for as long as I can." 

This message, he said, is "the only truth that can change lives and change the world," regardless of a person's background, nationality or present location.

Fox News виправив помилку, позначивши Київ як місто України. Fox News/YouTube

Після цього канал ще близько пів години транслював Великодню службу з Москви за участю глави Російської Православної Церкви патріарха Кіріла.

В **Міністерстві закордонних справ України** заявили, що телеканал має попросити вибачення за свою помилку та провести розслідування.

> "Якщо це була помилка, а не свідома політична заява, слід вибачитися та розслідувати, хто зробив помилку", — заявив речник МЗС Георгій Тихий.

Oroszország neve szerepelt Kijevé mellett az amerikai Fox News csatorna adásában, amelyben a különböző országok húsvéti ünnepségeit mutatták be, [írja](https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2025/04/20/7508362/)
 az Ukrajinszka Pravda. Többek között az orosz ortodox egyház ceremóniáját is bemutatták, amelyen Vlagyimir Putyin elnök is részt vett, majd nem sokkal később az ukránoké következett.

„Kijev, Ukrajna” – állt a felirat felvétel mellett, majd Ukrajnát egyszer csak kicserélték Oroszországra, amit aztán hosszabb ideig mutattak a képernyőn. Végül azért visszacsatolták Ukrajna fővárosát Ukrajnához.

Mindez jelentős felháborodást keltett az orosz agresszió áldozatául esett ország nyilvánosságában.

Fox news

Američka televizijska mreža **Fox News**, poznata po svojoj **pro-republikanskoj orijentaciji**, izazvala je val kritika i ogorčenja nakon što je na Uskrs emitirala **višeminutni prijenos pravoslavne mise** iz Rusije, na kojoj su prikazani **Vladimir Putin** i **patrijarh Kiril Gundjajev**. Tijekom više od **30 minuta emitiranja**, voditelji su Kijev nazvali “**ruskim gradom**“, što je izazvalo val negativnih reakcija u **Ukrajini**, ali i u **Sjedinjenim Američkim Državama**.

* * *

### **Kritike: “Legitimiziranje zločinaca” i “pranje imidža”**

Emitiranje mise s Putinom u prvom planu i patrijarhom Kirilom, koji je **otvoreno podržavao rusku agresiju na Ukrajinu**, mnogi su gledatelji i analitičari okarakterizirali kao **“legitimizaciju ubojica”**. Na društvenim mrežama zaredale su optužbe da **Fox News pokušava prikazati Putina kao uzornog kršćanina**, unatoč njegovim **neispunjenim obećanjima o uskrsnom primirju**, dok se u isto vrijeme nastavljaju **ruski napadi na ukrajinske gradove**.

* * *

### **Dvostruka mjerila i politička poruka?**

Komentatori su upozorili na **hipokriziju u pristupu**, budući da je televizijska kuća odlučila prikazivati **vjerski događaj** u režiji autokratskog režima, istovremeno **zanemarujući agresiju**, **civilne žrtve** i **ratna razaranja** koje taj isti režim provodi. Posebno je problematična izjava voditelja koji je **Kijev, [glavni grad](https://www.rijekadanas.com/pesut-na-skupstini-liste-za-rijeku-nas-glavni-grad-je-rijeka/)
 Ukrajine, nazvao ruskim gradom** – što je stav u potpunosti suprotan međunarodnom pravu i stajalištima većine zapadnih zemalja.

* * *

### **Reakcije iz Ukrajine**

Ukrajinski korisnici društvenih mreža, novinari i diplomati izrazili su **ogorčenje zbog emitiranja sadržaja koji potiče rusku propagandu**. Mnogi su podsjetili da patrijarh Kiril od početka rata **otvoreno blagoslivlja vojne operacije**, a da sam **Putin koristi vjerske događaje** kako bi prikrio političke i vojne ciljeve.

Elon Musk has pledged to “fix” X’s fact-checking tool following the release of polling contradicting United States President Donald Trump’s claim that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is deeply unpopular in his country.

Rowing in behind Trump’s attacks on Zelenskyy on Thursday, Musk claimed that his social media platform’s “community notes” feature was being “gamed” by governments and traditional media.

Musk made the claim while amplifying an anonymous right-wing X account that questioned the credibility of a widely cited Ukrainian polling outfit because of its work with the US Agency for International Development (USAID), which is being effectively dismantled under the billionaire’s cost-cutting drive.

“If Zelensky was actually loved by the people of Ukraine, he would hold an election. X is now relying on it too much, and it is ironic that leadership is now complaining that it isn’t working well.”

Musk’s broadside against Zelenskyy comes as the Ukrainian leader and the Trump administration have been [engaged in a war of words](/news/2025/2/20/us-switches-stance-on-ukraine-war-seeking-500bn-in-payback)
 over Washington’s efforts to reach a deal with Russia to end the war in Ukraine.

On Wednesday, Trump accused Zelenskyy of being a “dictator” after the Ukrainian leader rejected his claims that Kyiv was to blame for the war and raised concerns about being sidelined in Washington’s negotiations with Moscow.

Trump also claimed that Zelenskyy was “very low” in the polls in his country, echoing his earlier claim that the Ukrainian leader had an approval rating of just 4 percent.

In an opinion poll published by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology on Wednesday, 57 percent of Ukrainians said they trusted Zelenskyy, up five points from December.

The Ukrainian leader’s popularity, however, has waned as the war has gone on, dropping from 90 percent in March 2022 to 64 percent in February last year, according to the institute’s polling.

Since taking control of X, formerly known as Twitter, in 2022, Musk has been [heavily criticised](/economy/2023/5/2/twitter-fulfilling-more-government-censorship-requests-under-musk?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
 for allowing, and in some cases promoting, misinformation on the platform.

An analysis published by the nonprofit Center for Countering Digital Hate found that nearly three-quarters of a sample of false or misleading posts about the 2024 US elections did not display accurate notes correcting the record.

“I think there’s a strong chance that X/Twitter becomes a propaganda arm for Musk/Trump – and, in fact, it’s already happening,” Gordon Pennycook, a professor of psychology at Cornell University who studies misinformation, told Al Jazeera.

“I think Musk wants to reform community notes because he doesn’t like being corrected, as is typical for authoritarian oligarchs.”

Musk, one of Trump’s [most powerful allies](/news/2025/2/12/elon-musk-appears-at-white-house-defending-doges-work)
 as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), did not provide evidence of manipulation of X’s community notes system, which attaches explanatory notes to contentious posts based on the consensus of users.

The Tesla CEO, who later on Thursday appeared at the Conservative Political Action Conference waving a chainsaw in homage to Argentina’s cost-cutting president Javier Milei, also did not substantiate a claim that widely reported polling by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology was “Zelensky-controlled” and “not credible.”

Lucas Graves, a journalism professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who researches misinformation and disinformation, described Musk’s comments as “extremely concerning”.

“As is often the case with this kind of rhetoric, the accusations are a guide to what we have to look out for from the accuser – a world where private platforms like X can be systematically gamed to favour the political interests and alliances of their owners,” Graves told Al Jazeera.

“A well-designed community notes system can be a useful check on misinformation. He knows he would lose in a landslide, despite having seized control of ALL Ukrainian media, so he canceled the election,” Musk said on X, while sharing the unsubstantiated claim that US intelligence agencies estimate Zelenskyy’s approval to be just 4 percent.

“In reality, he is despised by the people of Ukraine, which is why he has refused to hold an election,” Musk said, referring to Zelenskyy’s decision to suspend elections after declaring martial law in the wake of Moscow’s 2022 invasion.

“I challenge Zelensky to hold an election and refute this."

 Thursday that he intends to "fix" Community Notes because it "is increasingly being gamed by governments & legacy media." He provided no evidence to support his claim.

*   [U.S. There's also Grok, the artificial intelligence chatbot that is owned by Musk's startup xAI and is used on X.

[Fortune](https://fortune.com/2025/01/28/elon-musk-grok-ai-not-a-good-person/)
 published a story in January about the many negative responses Grok provides when users ask if Musk is a good person. [Futurism](https://futurism.com/the-byte/grok-blasts-elon-musk-misinformation)
 published a similarly themed piece in December, with the headline "Elon Musk's Grok AI blasts Elon Musk as huge spreader of misinformation."

Musk calls Grok a "maximally truth-seeking" AI that is also "anti-woke." Earlier this week, xAI introduced its latest AI model, [Grok 3](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/18/elon-musk-xai-grok-3-model-release-ai-competition-.html)
, claiming it can outperform offerings from OpenAI and China's DeepSeek based on early testing, which included standardized tests on math, science and coding. 

Musk did admit during the demo that the model isn't perfect.

"We should emphasize that this is kind of a beta, meaning that you should expect some imperfections," Musk said. Under its constitution, Ukraine can't hold elections while it's at war and under martial law.

In his post Thursday, Musk wrote, "It should be utterly obvious that a Zelensky-controlled poll about his OWN approval is not credible!!" However, there are other available sources.

A consortium that's been conducting extensive polling in Ukraine since 2014 found "63% of Ukrainians now approve of Zelensky's performance as president, a notable increase from the previous year," Joe Stafford, the news and media relations lead at the University of Manchester, wrote in a [post](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/about/news/trump-is-making-false-claims-about-zelenskys-popularity/)
 Wednesday.

High favorability ratings for Zelenskyy undermine the narrative that Trump and Musk want to tell.

"If Zelensky was actually loved by the people of Ukraine, he would hold an election," Musk wrote, again without evidence. "It's not a paid person with the job of fact checking."

Musk is not immune
------------------

Additionally, while Musk has pitched Community Notes as a way to replace fact checkers, a recent [study](https://files.maldita.es/maldita/uploads/2025/02/maldita_informe_community_notes_2024.pdf)
 by the Spanish fact-checking nonprofit Maldita showed that many X users still rely on information from professionals."

Zelenskyy meets troops near Russian border

Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited troops in Ukraine's northern Sumy region today to award soldiers with state honours.

Extensive fighting in the border region since the war began in 2022 has intensified since Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk region last year.

"Our joint position with our partners is absolutely clear - the war must end. Thank you for the Kursk operation and for very brave steps," Zelenskyy told troops on the visit.

Rubio says US to decide on Russia sanctions soon

Marco Rubio said he is hopeful of making announcements later today on whether potential sanctions against Russia would still proceed this week. 

The US secretary of state said he had spoken to special envoy Steve Witkoff, who is on his way back from a trip to Russia, and would have more discussions throughout the day. 

He told reporters there would hopefully be some announcements soon: "Maybe positive, maybe not." 

The Kremlin said Witkoff held "useful and constructive" talks with Vladimir Putin today, two days before the expiry of a deadline set by Donald Trump for Russia to agree to peace in Ukraine or face new sanctions.

India: US tariffs 'unfair, unjustified and unreasonable'

Tariffs placed on India by the US over its imports of Russian oil are "unfair, unjustified and unreasonable", New Delhi's foreign ministry says.

Donald Trump earlier issued an executive order imposing an additional 25% tariff on India over its continued imports of Russian (see 15.10 post).

The US president said he believed declining global energy prices could pressure Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine.

In a statement, the Indian government labelled Trump's decision as "unfortunate", adding it will take "all actions necessary" to protect its national interests.

It says the country's imports are "based on market factors" and done with the objective of "ensuring the energy security of 1.4 billion people".

Ukraine war latest: Trump gives update on US-Putin talks - after doubling India tariffs in oil row
==================================================================================================

Donald Trump has hit India with new tariffs for buying Russian oil, while his envoy has held talks with Vladimir Putin in Moscow, two days before the US president's deadline for a ceasefire in the Ukraine war. Russia must end the war that it itself started. Thank you to everyone who stands with Ukraine."

'Russia isn't serious about Trump's deadline'

As we've mentioned, it appears the US will impose secondary sanctions on Russia on Friday - but is Moscow taking Washington seriously on its threats?

America's former ambassador to Ukraine says he's seen nothing from Trump in his seven months in office that would suggest he'd actually apply any serious sanctions on Moscow.

"The problem is that Trump set in the spring, maybe three times, deadlines of two weeks," Steven Pifer told [chief presenter Mark Austin](https://news.sky.com/author/mark-austin-983)
.

"Each time, the Russians did nothing to meet the deadline and Trump did nothing in terms of punitive measures against Moscow, so I'm not sure how serious they're treating this Friday deadline."

Pifer says that Vladimir Putin has consistently tried to portray himself as being prepared to engage with peace talks "without making any real compromise".

"I think what Putin is trying to do is string Trump along while he continues to let the Russian military do its thing against the Ukrainians on the ground."

Instead of placing tariffs on countries like India who still purchase Russian oil, Pifer says the best course of action to hurt Moscow would be to seize the nearly $300bn in frozen Russian assets and make those funds available for Ukraine. 

"That would signal to Putin that Ukraine will have the funding to continue this war for five, six, seven years."

President Donald Trump has traded barbs with Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy since the US-Russia talks in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on February 19, 2025 \[Nathan Howard/Reuters\]

By Claire Cranford and Louis Jacobson | PolitiFact

Published On 20 Feb 202520 Feb 2025

As the third anniversary of [Russia’s Ukraine invasion](/news/2022/2/24/putin-orders-military-operations-in-eastern-ukraine-as-un-meets)
 nears, United States President Donald Trump has offered a false version of history.

US and Russian representatives held [talks in Saudi Arabia](/news/2025/2/19/us-russia-talks-five-takeaways-from-rubio-lavrov-meeting-on-ukraine-war)
 this week that included a discussion on how to end the war in Ukraine. You should have ended it three years – you should have never started it, you could have made a deal.”

This clashes with the evidence that Russia sent a large invasion force into Ukraine in February 2022.

The notion that Kyiv “started it” – that it is to blame for an invasion that has killed an estimated 46,000 Ukrainian soldiers and at least 12,000 civilians – led to outrage in Ukraine and from its allies.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy responded that Trump “lives in this disinformation space”.

Trump’s deputy in his first term, Mike Pence, posted on February 19 on X, “Mr President, Ukraine did not ‘start’ this war. Zelenskyy has promised elections once martial law is lifted.

We asked the White House for evidence that Ukraine had started the war and received no response.

Russia’s attempt to blame Ukraine is part of a longstanding argument that does not stand up to scrutiny.

What happened in February 2022
------------------------------

As people were sleeping, Russian troops and tanks rolled into Ukraine and missiles poured down in what US military analysts called the [largest military operation](/news/2025/1/8/russia-gained-4000sq-km-of-ukraine-in-2024-how-many-soldiers-did-it-lose)
 in Europe since World War II. In Putin’s telling, “poor Russia was forced to rush to the persecuted Ukrainians’ defense and forestall NATO-inspired Ukrainian aggression”, Motyl said.

In 2023, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev echoed Putin’s stance, saying Ukraine is a part of Russia, but “we live in different apartments”.

Soon after the war started, more than 140 scholars signed a letter denouncing Putin’s narrative as “factually wrong, morally repugnant and deeply offensive to the memory of millions of victims of Nazism and those who courageously fought against it, including Russian and Ukrainian soldiers of the Red Army”.

As for Trump’s recent remark, it is a “distillation of these Russian talking points”, Herron said.

Our ruling
----------

Trump said Zelenskyy “started” the war in Ukraine with Russia.

On February 24, 2022, Russian forces launched an invasion of Ukraine, a country that the night before was at peace. Later, Trump dismissed complaints that Ukrainian officials were not invited to participate.

, answering reporters’ questions on February 18 at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Families packed belongings, swarmed ATMs and filling stations, and tried to flee the Russian invasion in cars, trains, planes and on foot.

How did the false talking point that Ukraine started the war begin?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

To set the stage for the invasion, Putin had long denied Ukraine was even a country, falsely characterising its history and culture, arguing the Ukrainians were simply Russians who needed to be brought back into the fold.

PolitiFact recognised Putin’s lies justifying the Ukraine war as “our 2022 Lie of the Year”.

In 1990, Ukraine’s parliament declared its independence from the Soviet Union, a call it repeated in August 1991. Since then, Putin has asserted that there is no such thing as a Ukrainian people separate from Russia.

“These claims were designed to deny the existence and agency of the Ukrainian nation,” Erik Herron, a West Virginia University political scientist and author of the book Elections and Democracy after Communism, told PolitiFact in 2022.

Yet, the history of Ukraine has involved several empires or states, some of which were entirely separate from Russia, Eugene Finkel, an associate professor with Johns Hopkins University’s School of Advanced International Studies, told PolitiFact on the eve of the war.

Putin set the table for the 2022 invasion with a 5,000-word essay in July 2021. The Road to Peace must be built on the Truth.”

After Zelenskyy’s comments, Trump piled on [more attacks](/news/2025/2/19/dictator-trump-feuds-with-zelenskyy-amid-negotiations-over-ukraine-war)
 on Truth Social, claiming the Ukrainian president “is very low in Ukrainian Polls” and is “a Dictator without Elections”.

In a Kyiv International Institute of Sociology poll conducted between February 4 and 9, Zelenskyy had a 57 percent trust rating among Ukrainians surveyed. That is down from 90 percent in May 2022, shortly after Russia’s invasion, but up from 52 percent in December 2024. [Russian President Vladimir Putin](/news/2025/2/19/putin-rates-us-talks-highly-says-russia-ready-to-negotiate-over-ukraine)
 announced it as a “special military operation” at 6am Moscow time (03:00 GMT) on February 24, 2022.

“The purpose of this operation is to protect people who, for eight years now, have been facing humiliation and genocide perpetrated by the Kyiv regime,” Putin said in a televised address."

Top Questions

### 

When did the Russia-Ukraine War begin?

The full-scale invasion of Ukraine by Russia on February 24, 2022, was the expansion of a war between the two countries that had begun in February 2014, when disguised Russian troops [covertly invaded and took control](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Ukraine-crisis#ref323583)
 of the Ukrainian autonomous republic of [Crimea](https://www.britannica.com/place/Crimea)
. It also estimated Ukrainian military casualties since 2022 to be 400,000, including an estimated 60,000–100,000 soldiers killed.

### 

Why did Vladimir Putin invade Ukraine in 2022?

[Vladimir Putin](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Vladimir-Putin)
’s invasion followed years of tension between [Russia](https://www.britannica.com/place/Russia)
 and [Ukraine](https://www.britannica.com/place/Ukraine)
 as Ukraine moved toward closer ties with the West, which Putin viewed as a threat to Russia’s influence. The overwhelming majority of these casualties, which were verified by UN personnel, occurred in Ukraine.

### 

How has Russia’s war against Ukraine affected Ukraine’s population?

More than eight million people fled Ukraine after Russia’s 2022 invasion, and a similar number were internally displaced. In March 2023 the International Criminal Court concluded that Russia’s mass kidnapping campaign constituted a war crime.

Russia’s [destruction of Kakhovka Dam](https://www.britannica.com/event/2022-Russian-invasion-of-Ukraine/The-Ukrainian-counterattack#ref374607)
 on the Dnipro River in June 2023 is also an example of how Russian forces have attacked Ukrainian infrastructure to inflict suffering on Ukraine’s population: some 240 square miles (620 square km) of territory were flooded, scores of people died, and dozens of towns were inundated, with up to 1 million people left without drinking water.

### 

How has the war in Ukraine impacted Russia’s military capabilities?

Russia’s visually confirmed losses as of early 2024 totaled more than 8,000 armored vehicles, including some 2,700 tanks. In recognition of Russia’s continued hybrid warfare campaign against Ukraine, the framework called for mediated talks between the two governments rather than any attempts at bilateral engagement.

Content: "Putin responded by invading Ukraine on February 24th, 2022.

Second, the Biden administration has reacted to the outbreak of the war by doubling down against Russia. In response, Russia seized Crimea from Ukraine and helped fuel a civil war that broke out in the Donbass between pro-Russian separatists and the Ukrainian government.

One often hears the argument that in the eight years between when the crisis broke out in February 2014 and when the war began in February 2022, the United States and its allies paid little attention to bringing Ukraine into NATO. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov made the point succinctly at a press conference on January 14th, 2022, when he said, “the key to everything is the guarantee that NATO will not expand eastward.”

Nevertheless, the efforts of Lavrov and Putin to get the United States and its allies to abandon their efforts to make Ukraine a Western bulwark on Russia’s border failed completely. The Causes and Consequences of the Ukraine War
==============================================

_**! We live in perilous times.

Let me now lay out my argument in greater detail, starting with a description of the conventional wisdom about the causes of the conflict.

The Conventional Wisdom

It is widely and firmly believed in the West that Putin is solely responsible for causing the Ukraine crisis and certainly the ongoing war. In his July 12th, 2021, article about Russian-Ukrainian relations, which proponents of the conventional wisdom often point to as evidence of his imperial ambitions, he tells the Ukrainian people, “You want to establish a state of your own: you are welcome!” Regarding how Russia should treat Ukraine, he writes, “There is only one answer: with respect.” He concludes that lengthy article with the following words: “And what Ukraine will be—it is up to its citizens to decide.” It is hard to reconcile these statements with the claim that he wants to incorporate Ukraine within a greater Russia.

In that same July 12th, 2021 article and again in an important speech he gave on February 21st, 2022, Putin emphasized that Russia accepts “the new geopolitical reality that took shape after the dissolution of the USSR.” He reiterated that same point for a third time on February 24th, 2022, when he announced that Russia would invade Ukraine. In short, Russia did not have the capability to subdue all of Ukraine, much less conquer other countries in Eastern Europe.

To take this argument a step further, Putin and other Russian leaders surely understand from the Cold War that occupying counties in the age of nationalism is invariably a prescription for never-ending trouble. Let me now turn to the real cause of the Ukraine crisis.

The Real Cause of the Crisis

The taproot of the crisis is the American-led effort to make Ukraine a Western bulwark on Russia’s borders. From his perspective, that would be a declaration of war.”

The Bush administration, which was pushing such a decision for NATO however, cared little about Moscow’s “brightest of red lines” and pressured the French and German leaders to agree to issuing a public pronouncement that said unequivocally that Ukraine and Georgia would eventually join the alliance.

Unsurprisingly, the American-led effort to integrate Georgia into NATO resulted in a war between Georgia and Russia in August 2008—just four months after the Bucharest summit. He made a series of moves—like shutting down pro-Russian TV stations and arresting an especially close friend of Putin and charging him with treason—that were sure to anger Moscow.

President Biden, who moved into the White House in January 2021, had long been committed to bringing Ukraine into NATO and was also super-hawkish towards Russia."

The death toll from a devastating storm that battered the southeastern United States climbed to at least 130 on Monday, as the disaster became a hot topic in an already bitter election campaign, with the [White House](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/white-house/)
 angrily refuting claims it had been slow to respond.

With hundreds still missing across several southeastern US states and the death toll climbing, President Joe Biden announced he would travel to storm-ravaged North Carolina Wednesday to monitor rescue efforts.

Biden also accused former president Donald Trump of spreading lies, after the Republican presidential candidate charged, without evidence, that the federal government was ignoring the disaster brought on by Hurricane Helene and denying help to his supporters.

"He's lying," Biden told reporters in the Oval Office, adding that he had spoken to North Carolina governor Ray Cooper "and he told him he's lying. A president's role is usually to oversee and coordinate aid, including funding.

Scientists say [climate change](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/climate-change/)
 likely plays a role in the rapid intensification of hurricanes, because there is more energy in warmer oceans for them to feed on, and Biden stressed as much Monday.

"Absolutely, positively, unequivocally, yes, yes, yes, yes," Biden told reporters in the Oval Office when asked if climate change was to blame for the trail of destruction left by the storm.

Drowned in their homes
----------------------

The sheriff's office in Pinellas County, Florida, published a grim litany of the nine lives lost there so far, almost all of whose bodies were found in their homes.

Nearly all appeared to have drowned, it said, describing some found still lying in several inches of water, while others were buried under debris.

In Georgia, residents faced power cuts, supply shortages, blocked roads and broken communication lines in often mountainous terrain, with Governor Brian Kemp describing the storm as a "250-mile wide tornado."

Close to two million households and businesses remained without power on Monday, according to tracker poweroutage.us.

Cooper, the North Carolina governor, said Monday that hundreds of roads had been destroyed and many communities were "wiped off the map."

"This is an unprecedented storm," he told reporters.  "The emotional and physical toll here is indescribable."

Cooper, a Democrat, also thanked Biden for providing federal personnel and resources.

Biden defends government response as Hurricane Helene death toll reaches 130
============================================================================

Americas

The death toll from a storm in the southeastern US reached 130 on Monday, sparking election campaign tensions. "The vice president, she's out someplace, campaigning, looking for money," he said, referring to his election rival, Vice President Kamala Harris.

"We're not talking about politics now," he said later, wearing a bright red "Make America Great Again" hat while standing in the rubble of a furniture store.

Democrat Harris, canceled campaign events to return to Washington Monday for a briefing on the federal response.

"Over the past few days, our nation has endured some of the worst destruction and devastation that we have seen in quite some time," Harris said following the briefing.

"And we have responded with our best, with the best folks who are on the ground and here doing the kind of work that is about rising to a moment of crisis."

Responding to Trump's criticism that he was "sleeping" instead of dealing with the storm damage, Biden defended his decision to spend the weekend at his home in Delaware, saying he was working "the whole time."

When a major natural disaster hits the United States, the federal government responds at the request of states. that's simply not true, and it's irresponsible."

At least 118 people were killed by the storm and associated flooding -- 49 in North Carolina, 25 in South Carolina, 25 in Georgia, 14 in Florida, four in Tennessee and one in Virginia, according to tallies from local authorities compiled by AFP.

Emergency workers continued a grim search for hundreds of people still unaccounted for across the affected states, where torrential rains brought widespread havoc.

They also worked to restore [water](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/water/)
 and power supply to the affected areas, remove fallen trees, deliver supplies and register people for disaster assistance.

The death toll was expected to rise, authorities warned, with cell phone service knocked out across much of the region and up to 600 people still missing.

Biden accused of 'sleeping' 
----------------------------

With Biden preparing to head to North Carolina, Trump on Monday arrived in Georgia, another epicenter of the destruction -- and both are among the key swing states where the US election will be decided in just five weeks' time.

In the city of Valdosta, Georgia, Trump vowed to "bring lots of relief material, including fuel, equipment, water, and other things" to those in need.

"The federal government is not being responsive," he told reporters."

President Joe Biden has said the "irresponsible and relentless promotion of disinformation and outright lies" about the government's hurricane response is "undermining confidence" in rescue and recovery efforts, even as Hurricane Milton heads towards Florida.

Since Hurricane Helene caused widespread damage in several states, misleading and false claims have been spreading and have intensified as Florida prepares for a new hurricane.

Against the backdrop of the election campaign, Donald Trump has been highly critical of the Biden-Harris administration's response.

Biden has responded by condemning a number of claims by Trump and other Republicans - BBC Verify has been examining them.

Has government money for hurricane victims been spent on migrants?
------------------------------------------------------------------

At multiple campaign events since the hurricane struck, Trump and his allies have claimed that government money earmarked for disaster victims has been spent on migrants who crossed illegally into the US.

“Kamala spent all her Fema money - billions of dollars - on housing for illegal migrants," Trump said in Michigan last week.

This claim is false.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), a government agency, has a Disaster Relief Fund - worth more than $20bn (£15bn) for the last financial year - which is ring-fenced to spend on responding to hurricanes and other natural disasters.

Fema also has a dedicated budget from Congress to be spent on food, shelter, transportation, and other support services for immigrants released from Department of Homeland Security (DHS) custody.

This budget amounts to around $1bn over the last two financial years - not the “billions” Trump claims.

So, these are two separate pots of money - administered by the agency - which Trump appears to be conflating.

Fema, which has now set up a [fact-checking page](https://www.fema.gov/disaster/current/hurricane-helene/rumor-response)
 on its website, called Trump's claim "false" saying, "no money is being diverted from disaster response needs".

In 2019, while Trump was president, money was diverted [from Fema's Disaster Relief Fund](https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/fema_-_disaster_relief_fund_-_september_2019.pdf)
 - around $38m - to give to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

The focus on Fema's current funding comes after the Secretary of Homeland Security, Alejandro Mayorkas - who oversees the agency - warned that it was running low on funds for the rest of the hurricane season.

But Fema says it has “enough money right now for immediate response and recovery needs”.

[Political row erupts over Hurricane Helene disaster relief\
----------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y3qgqxpwno)

Are hurricane victims only getting $750?
----------------------------------------

Donald Trump and his running mate JD Vance have repeatedly highlighted a $750 payment from Fema to hurricane victims, often contrasting it with the money the US government spends on Ukraine or on illegal migrants.

“They promised $750 to American citizens who have lost everything,” Vance said at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania on Saturday.

It is true that the victims are getting $750 but some context is needed.

This is just one type of assistance provided by Fema.

The $750 is what people can get as an [upfront payment](https://www.fema.gov/node/fema-will-only-provide-750-disaster-survivors-support-their-recovery)
 to help cover the costs of food, water, medication, and other emergency supplies.

Following this initial payment, disaster victims may receive additional funds following a Fema assessment.

This can go towards repairing damage to homes and personal property, and to help find a temporary place to stay.

So far, [Fema has said that more than $210m](https://www.fema.gov/press-release/20241007/federal-assistance-hurricane-helene-exceeds-210-million-fema-prepares-dual)
 has been given to communities affected by Hurricane Helene - this includes upfront payments and money to support housing needs.

! By the time Trump made this remark on 5 October, the North Carolina National Guard, which is under the dual command of federal and state governments, had already [posted on X](https://x.com/ncnationalguard/status/1841976269941952920?s=46)
 that its “air assets have completed 146 flight missions, resulting in the rescue of 538 people and 150 pets”.

The post, published on 3 October, featured a video of a National Guard helicopter.

The [North Carolina Department of Public Safety's website](https://www.ncdps.gov/news/press-releases/2024/10/05/hurricane-helene-recovery-progresses-western-north-carolina)
 says that President Biden approved the state governor’s request for military personnel and equipment to support rescue operations in North Carolina.

The National Guard and military personnel “are operating 50 helicopters” as part of search and rescue missions, and are also helping to deliver critical supplies in the state, the department said.

Did Biden call the Governor of Georgia?
---------------------------------------

When the hurricane first hit, Trump claimed that the governor of Georgia hadn’t spoken to President Biden following the state being badly affected.

“He has been calling the president, hasn't been able to get him,” Trump said at a news conference in Georgia on the afternoon of 30 September.

But earlier that day, Georgia’s Governor Brian Kemp - a Republican - said in an interview: “The president just called me yesterday afternoon, I missed him and called him right back, and he just said ‘hey what do you need?’ and I told him we’ve got what we need, we’re working through the federal process.”

“He offered if there’s other things we need to call him directly, which I appreciate,” he added.

Were any helicopters sent to help victims?

Trump said at the Butler rally that “Kamala wined and dined in San Francisco, and all of the people in North Carolina - no helicopters, no rescue - it’s just - what’s happened there is very bad.”

Content: "In a brief exchange with reporters, he described the impact of the storm as “stunning” and said that the administration is giving states “everything we have” to help with their response to the storm.

Biden planned to speak about the administration’s response efforts in remarks from the White House on Monday.

The White House also said Vice President Kamala Harris will visit the storm-ravaged areas “as soon as it is possible without disrupting emergency response operations.” At a Las Vegas rally Sunday night, Harris spoke about the impact of Helene, saying, “I know everyone here sends their thoughts and prayer for the folks who have been so devastated by that hurricane.”

She added: “We will stand with these communities for as long as it takes and make sure they are able to rebuild.”

Harris was spending Sunday night in Las Vegas and had planned campaign stops in the city on Monday. Harris received similar briefings while on board Air Force Two, according to the White House.

The White House said Biden directed Criswell to figure out what can be done to accelerate support to isolated communities that are having difficulty accessing assistance.

Former President [Donald Trump’s](https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump)
 campaign announced earlier Sunday he’ll visit Valdosta, Georgia, on Monday to survey Helene’s impact on that state, one of several hotly contested battlegrounds that will be pivotal in the [November presidential election](https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024)
.

Trump is expected to receive a briefing, facilitate the distribution of relief supplies and deliver remarks during the visit, according to his campaign.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The provided evidence does not contain any information about President Biden announcing a halt to aid for Hurricane Helene-affected areas or allocating $2.4 billion to Ukraine. The evidence focuses on Biden's response to the hurricane, including his visit to affected areas and refuting misinformation.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available evidence.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

White House blasts false claims about Hurricane Helene and relief aid
=====================================================================

This article is more than 10 months old

Statement comes as president urges Congress to pass disaster-relief package as costs soar amid devastation

The White House moved Saturday to quash claims that government officials control the weather, including a far-fetched rumor circulating on social media that [Hurricane Helene](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hurricane-helene)
 was an engineered storm to allow corporations to mine regional lithium deposits.

“We have seen a large increase in false information circulating online related to the federal response to Hurricane Helene,” a statement said, pointing to a “number of scam artists, bad-faith actors, and others who want to sow chaos because they think it helps their political interests are promoting disinformation about the recovery effort.”

The White House said the rumors, which include claims that emergency disaster money had been spent housing immigrants and that relief funds would be limited to $750 per claim, were “wrong, dangerous” and said “it must stop immediately”.

The warning, which speaks to the intense political environment Helene figuratively crashed into, came hours after Biden told lawmakers to refill the coffers of disaster relief programs as the projected recovery and rebuilding costs related to Hurricane Helene are estimated to be as much as $200bn over 10 years.

[In a letter sent to congressional leaders](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/10/04/letter-to-congress-on-disaster-needs/)
, the president said while the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) and the Department of Defense are able to meet “critical life-saving and life-sustaining missions and will continue to do so within present funding levels”, they will need additional funding.

“My administration has provided robust and well-coordinated federal support for the ongoing response and recovery efforts,” Biden wrote.

“As with other catastrophic disasters, it will take some time to assess the full requirements for response and recovery efforts, and I fully expect that the Congress will do its part to provide the funding needed.”

Biden said that a comprehensive disaster relief package would be necessary when Congress returns on 12 November – but said action on individual programs could be needed before then. But there are currently no plans for Congress to reconvene before the election.

The request comes as Kamala Harris cut short a campaign swing through the western states to visit western North Carolina in the southern Appalachian mountains where entire towns were washed away.

Biden viewed the damage and cleanup efforts in the Carolinas by air on Wednesday, and again in Florida and Georgia on Thursday. Administration officials [told CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/04/politics/biden-warns-congress-disaster-funding-run-out/index.html)
 that the program needs $1.6bn in additional funding to meet about 3,000 Hurricane Helene-related applications it is receiving daily.

Last month, before Helene hit, the White House [warned](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/H.R.-9747-Continuing-Appropriations-and-Extensions-Act-2025-Final-Updated.pdf)
 that the low funding levels could lead to the SBA “effectively ceasing operations” after paying out for weather-related costs and accidents, including the Key Bridge collapse in Baltimore, the continued recovery after Maui’s wildfires and tornado damage in the midwest.

A storm-damaged area in the wake of Hurricane Helene in Florida on Thursday. He said the work to rebuild will cost “billions of dollars” and additional disaster relief funding “can’t wait … people need help now”.

At least 225 people have been confirmed dead from Helene, and officials say they expect the death toll to continue to rise as recovery efforts continue. A police department spokesperson in Asheville, North Carolina, [told CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hurricane-helene-satellite-images-north-carolina/)
 in an email late on Friday that it is “actively working 75 cases of missing persons”. Nearly 1 million people remain without power.

In his letter to lawmakers, Biden said that funding through the Small Business Administration (SBA) “will run out of funding in a matter of weeks and well before the Congress is planning to reconvene”.

The SBA is designed to help small business owners and homeowners recoup property and equipment through the disaster relief loan program."

The death toll from a devastating storm that battered the southeastern United States climbed to at least 130 on Monday, September 30, as the disaster became a hot topic in an already bitter election campaign, with the White House angrily refuting claims it had been slow to respond.

With hundreds still missing across several southeastern US states and the death toll climbing, President Joe Biden announced he would travel to storm-ravaged North Carolina Wednesday to monitor rescue efforts.

Biden also accused former president Donald Trump of spreading lies, after the Republican presidential candidate charged, without evidence, that the federal government was ignoring the disaster brought on by Hurricane Helene and denying help to his supporters. A president's role is usually to oversee and coordinate aid, including funding.

Scientists say climate change likely plays a role in the rapid intensification of hurricanes, because there is more energy in warmer oceans for them to feed on, and Biden stressed as much Monday. "He's lying," Biden told reporters in the Oval Office, adding that he had spoken to North Carolina governor Ray Cooper "and he told him he's lying. that's simply not true, and it's irresponsible."

At least 130 people were killed by the storm and associated flooding: 57 in North Carolina, 29 in South Carolina, 25 in Georgia, 14 in Florida, four in Tennessee and one in Virginia, according to tallies from local authorities and media reports compiled by Agence France-Presse (AFP).

Widespread havoc
----------------

Emergency workers continued a grim search for hundreds of people still unaccounted for across the affected states, where torrential rains brought widespread havoc. The death toll was expected to rise, authorities warned, with cell phone service knocked out across much of the region and up to 600 people still missing.

With Biden preparing to head to North Carolina, Trump on Monday arrived in Georgia, another epicenter of the destruction – and both are among the key swing states where the US election will be decided in just five weeks. "The vice president, she's out someplace, campaigning, looking for money," he said, referring to his election rival, Vice President Kamala Harris. "We're not talking about politics now," he said later, wearing a bright red "Make America Great Again" hat while standing in the rubble of a furniture store.

Democrat Harris, canceled campaign events to return to Washington Monday for a briefing on the federal response. "Over the past few days, our nation has endured some of the worst destruction and devastation that we have seen in quite some time," Harris said following the briefing."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The new evidence still does not support the claim. The Guardian article focuses on Biden urging Congress for disaster relief funds, and Le Monde reports on Biden's remarks about the hurricane response and his travel plans. Neither source mentions Biden halting aid to hurricane-affected areas or allocating funds to Ukraine.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified.

France 24 ([Source](https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20241001-biden-defends-government-response-as-hurricane-helene-death-toll-reaches-118)) reported on President Biden's response to Hurricane Helene, including his visit to North Carolina and his refutation of claims about the government's response.

## Elaboration
The provided evidence does not contain any information about President Biden announcing a halt to aid for Hurricane Helene-affected areas or allocating $2.4 billion to Ukraine. The evidence focuses on Biden's response to the hurricane, including his visit to affected areas and refuting misinformation.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available evidence.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Guardian ([Source](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/05/biden-urges-congress-helene-relief-funds)) reported on the White House's response to misinformation regarding Hurricane Helene relief efforts, including Biden urging Congress to pass a disaster-relief package. Le Monde ([Source](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/united-states/article/2024/09/30/biden-pledges-to-aid-victims-of-hurrican-helene-as-long-as-it-takes_6727795_133.html)) reported that on September 30, 2024, Biden delivered remarks on the response to Hurricane Helene at the White House <image:10022> and announced he would travel to North Carolina.


## Elaboration
The new evidence still does not support the claim. The Guardian article focuses on Biden urging Congress for disaster relief funds, and Le Monde reports on Biden's remarks about the hurricane response and his travel plans. Neither source mentions Biden halting aid to hurricane-affected areas or allocating funds to Ukraine.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified.

Misleading claims targeting the German chancellor have been spreading online days before German voters head to the polls to elect a new government.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](https://static.euronews.com/website/images/logos/logo-euronews-stacked-outlined-72x72-grey-9.svg) ADVERTISEMENT

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has not ordered a state of emergency in Germany over the US’s bilateral peace negotiations with Russia, despite the claim spreading widely across social platforms.

Users on X, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok falsely accused Scholz of urging parliament to impose a state of emergency — known as "Notstand" in German — that would severely curtail citizens’ rights.

But a closer look at Scholz’s speech reveals he was referring to "Notlage", an entirely different concept in the German Basic Law that refers to an urgent situation, but which is not synonymous with a government-imposed state of emergency.

Speaking over the weekend as the Trump administration geared for talks with Russian officials in the Saudi Arabian capital, Riyadh, Scholz said: “The Bundestag should pass a resolution as soon as possible according to which the war in Ukraine and its serious consequences for the security of Germany and Europe are classified as an emergency (Notlage) within the meaning of Article 115 paragraph two of the Basic Law.”

The article referenced by Scholz states that natural disasters or “exceptional emergency situations” can justify changes to the country’s so-called debt brake, allowing the government to borrow beyond the credit limit.

**What is the debt brake and how could it be used to finance defence spending?**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Germany has strict limits on government borrowing, known as a debt brake. It’s aimed at restricting the budget deficit to less than 0.35% of the country’s annual gross domestic product (GDP).

The debt brake became legally binding for the government in 2016 and for the federal states in 2020.

In recent months, both Scholz’ Social Democrats (SPD) and the Greens have advocated for suspending the debt brake in response to the war in Ukraine and the ensuing energy crisis.

Scholz’s other coalition partners, the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP), fiercely opposed the move, contributing to a breakdown in trust that collapsed the three-way coalition government last November.

Scholz has said he expects the next government, which will be elected on Sunday, to trigger this article to ramp up its spending on defence and security.

The Christian Democrats’ Friedrich Merz, who is tipped to become the next German chancellor, has also expressed [**openness**](https://www.euronews.com/business/2025/02/10/chancellor-hopeful-merz-open-to-reform-of-germanys-debt-brake)
 to loosening the debt brake once other options have been exhausted.

This is despite a broad camp of his CDU party opposing any changes to Germany's strict borrowing limits.

**Misleading claims spread days before crunch vote**
----------------------------------------------------

The misleading claims targeting Scholz come days before German voters head to the ballot boxes to elect a new government.

The Conservative Christian Democrats (CDU/CSU) are poised to emerge as the biggest party and form a government, but could be forced to rely on the support of Scholz's Social Democratic Party to do so.

The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party is currently polling in second place.

There is concern that coordinated misinformation campaigns, including those engineered by the Kremlin, could put the integrity of the vote at risk.

A German non-profit has detected Russia's well-known "Doppelgänger" campaign resurfacing, cloning the websites of renowned media outlets by purchasing similar-looking domains to spread falsified news articles.

The European Commission has attempted to minimise risks by engaging with social media platforms, including in a roundtable in Berlin and a recent [**stress test**](https://www.euronews.com/next/2025/01/24/online-platforms-participate-in-stress-test-ahead-of-german-election)
 of their of their risk mitigation measures.

From [Source](https://www.politico.eu/article/olaf-scholz-germany-donald-trump-war-in-ukraine-peace-plan/): 
Content: "President Donald Trump appears not to have told Chancellor Olaf Scholz about his impending bombshell peace plan for Ukraine, despite Germany’s crucial role in supplying arms and aid to Kyiv.

Scholz spoke to POLITICO on Wednesday, only hours before the Trump administration’s shock announcement that it would conduct peace negotiations over the head of European leaders, effectively ceding Ukrainian territory to Russia and insisting that Europe should provide the lion’s share of military and financial aid.

In his conversation with Berlin Playbook, Scholz said he had been receiving indications from Trump and his advisers that Washington would not perform such a dramatic U-turn on support for Kyiv.

“The talks that I have had with \[Trump\] and that my advisers have also had with his advisers lead to the conclusion that we can hope and assume that the U.S. troops involved in any peacekeeping operation.

The German chancellery has not yet responded to a request for comment relating to the latest developments.

On the question of whether Germany would send troops as part of a peacekeeping operation in Ukraine, Scholz suggested there would be no solution without U.S. is involved, because transatlantic unity must always be guaranteed,” Scholz said when asked whether Gemany would send troops as part of any potential peacekeeping operation.

The fact that the chancellor of the EU’s biggest economy appeared to be unaware of Washington’s plans suggests Scholz’s expectation for transatlantic unity was misguided.

Germany is second only to the U.S. Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio will meet Ukrainian leader Volodymyr  Zelenskyy.

In Munich, Vance is also [scheduled](https://www.politico.eu/article/jd-vance-and-germanys-likely-next-chancellor-set-to-talk-ukraine-trade/)
 to meet Germany’s likely next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, in what will be the first high-level meeting between a member of Trump’s second administration and the German conservatives — who are in pole position to lead the country’s next government after the Feb. 23 parliamentary election.

German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius, meanwhile, criticized Trump’s stance on negotiations with Moscow, lamenting that his administration had “made public concessions to Putin before talks even began.”

“In my view, it would have been better to discuss issues like Ukraine’s potential NATO membership or territorial losses at the negotiating table — not beforehand,” the politician from Scholz’s center-left Social Democratic Party said ahead of a meeting of NATO defense ministers in Brussels.

_Chris Lunday contributed reporting._ will continue to support Ukraine,” Scholz told POLITICO’s Berlin Playbook podcast hours before Trump effectively called time on its support for Kyiv as it resists Russia’s invasion.

Later on Wednesday, Trump announced he would begin immediate negotiations with Russian President Vladimir Putin while U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ruled out Ukrainian membership in NATO and said Europe “must provide the overwhelming share of future lethal and nonlethal aid to Ukraine.”

Hegseth also warned his counterparts at a NATO meeting in Brussels that Ukraine would not be able to take back all the territory Russia had seized, and said there would be no U.S. The country has also hosted around 1.2 million Ukrainians who have fled their country since Russia’s invasion almost three years ago.

“We have supported Ukraine over all these years,” Scholz said. “This is the basis for creating the prospect of a peaceful solution that is not a dictated peace over Ukraine. That must remain the principle, that decisions are not made over the heads of the Ukrainians.”

GERMAN CHANCELLOR OLAF SCHOLZ
-----------------------------

On the idea of deploying European peacekeepers, Scholz said it was "completely premature and completely the wrong time to have this discussion now ... At the same time we need a surge in defense in Europe."

(This story has been corrected to clarify that Scholz did not say that Germany was prepared to contribute soldiers to a security guarantee for Ukraine, in paragraph 3)

Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer speaks during the Prime Minister's Questions at the House of Commons in London, Britain, February 12, 2025. I want to say that quite frankly, people are talking over Ukraine's head, about the outcome of peace talks that have not taken place and to which Ukraine has not said yes."

On defense spending, Scholz said: "If European states want to spend more (than 2%) on defense, Germany is supportive that this expenditure is not taken into account in European budget deficit calculations."

BRITISH PRIME MINISTER KEIR STARMER
-----------------------------------

"Today's informal meeting of European leaders was a vital first step in responding to that challenge on defense. that defense spending will no longer be treated as excessive spending, so we will not be at risk of the excessive deficit procedure and all its unpleasant consequences."

DANISH PRIME MINISTER METTE FREDERIKSEN:

"All Europeans have to step up when it comes to Ukraine, and at the same time step up defense spending at home, because Russia is threatening all of Europe now, unfortunately."

"I don't think they are going to stop in Ukraine and therefore I'm very concerned about making a fast ceasefire because it could give Putin and Russia a possibility to go back and mobilize again, attack Ukraine or another country in Europe."

"When it comes to European defense spending, I expect that when we meet in the European Council next time, we will have an agreement about the fiscal rules and the way forward in ensuring that all member states can actually lift our expenditures on the defense."

On possibly sending Danish troops: "We are open to discussing many different things, but I would also like to emphasize that there are really really many things that need to be clarified before we reach this situation, because we are talking about the safety of our own men and women."

SPANISH PRIME MINISTER PEDRO SANCHEZ:

"The peace talks must actively involve the EU and Ukraine, reinforce the multilateral order and international law, and also reinforce Europe."

"We welcome such talks that could derive in a just and lasting peace, but we must remind ourselves that it cannot be a false closure. It's clear the US is not going to leave NATO, but we Europeans will have to do more."

"The issue of burden sharing is not new, but it is now pressing, and Europeans will have to step up, both in terms of spending and the capabilities that we provide on Ukraine."

"We're at the very early stage of the process. security guarantee is the only way to effectively deter Russia from attacking Ukraine again."

POLISH PRIME MINISTER DONALD TUSK
---------------------------------

"Transatlantic relations and our friendship with the United States are at a new stage and we all see that. We cannot repeat the mistakes of the past."

EUROPEAN COMMISSION PRESIDENT URSULA VON DER LEYEN
--------------------------------------------------

"Today in Paris we reaffirmed that Ukraine deserves peace through strength. Peace respectful of its independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, with strong security guarantees. Europe carries its full share of the military assistance to Ukraine."

As President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin prepare to [meet in Alaska](https://www.npr.org/2025/08/08/nx-s1-5347716/trump-putin-meeting)
 later this week, European leaders have stressed that Ukraine must be included in any talks with Russia over ending the war in Ukraine.

Leaders including French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said they welcome Trump's work to "stop the killing in Ukraine," but that the "path to peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without Ukraine."

"We are convinced that only an approach that combines active diplomacy, support to Ukraine and pressure on the Russian Federation to end their illegal war can succeed," the leaders wrote in a [joint statement](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/joint-leaders-statement-on-peace-for-ukraine)
 issued on Saturday.

The European leaders also stressed in their joint statement a need for "robust and credible security guarantees" that allow Ukraine to defend its territory.

Their statement follows a meeting that Vice President JD Vance and U.K. Vance said in an interview recorded before his overseas meeting that the meeting between Trump and Putin represents a "major breakthrough for American diplomacy."

"We're going to try to find some negotiated settlement that the Ukrainians and the Russians can live with where they can live in relative peace, where the killing stops," Vance told Maria Bartiromo in [an interview](https://www.foxnews.com/video/6376764434112)
 on Fox News' _Sunday Morning Futures._

"It's not going to make anybody super happy. "We're at a point now … we're now trying to figure out, frankly, scheduling and things like that, around when these three leaders could sit down and discuss an end to this conflict," he said, speaking about Trump, Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Zelenskyy has said he supports Trump's efforts to leverage a peace deal, but it is still unclear whether he will attend the meeting. Zelenskyy has maintained that Ukraine will not give up any land, and said it is up to Putin to end the war.

"The Ukrainian people deserve peace. Foreign Secretary David Lammy held with Ukrainian and European officials over the weekend in London.

Trump is set to meet with Putin on Friday in Alaska to discuss an end to the war. But all partners must understand what a dignified peace is. "Ukrainians will not gift their land to the occupier."

 could swiftly be followed by a second that would include the leader of Ukraine.

Trump did not specify what the consequences could be, but he has warned of economic sanctions if his meeting with Putin [in Alaska on Friday](/world/europe/what-deal-might-emerge-trump-putin-summit-could-it-hold-2025-08-12/)

The comments by Trump and the outcome of a [virtual conference](/world/europe/trump-european-leaders-comment-videoconference-ukraine-2025-08-13/)
 with Trump, European leaders and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy held on Wednesday could provide encouragement for Kyiv after fears the Alaska summit could end up selling out Ukraine by [carving up its territory](/world/americas/how-much-territory-does-russia-control-ukraine-2025-08-14/)
.

However, Russia is likely to resist Ukraine and Europe's demands strongly and previously has said its stance had not changed since it was first detailed by Putin [in June 2024](/world/europe/putin-says-west-needs-find-way-work-with-russia-2024-06-14/)
.

When asked if Russia would face any consequences if Putin does not agree to stop the war after Friday’s meeting, Trump responded: “Yes, they will.”

Asked if those consequences would be sanctions or tariffs, Trump told reporters: “I don't have to say. But polls also indicate Ukrainians do not want peace at any cost if that means significant concessions.

Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Alexei Fadeev earlier said Moscow's [stance had not changed](/world/europe/russia-says-its-demands-are-unchanged-full-ukrainian-withdrawal-regions-that-2025-08-13/)
 since last year.

As conditions for a ceasefire and the start of talks, Putin had demanded Ukraine withdraw its forces from four regions that Russia has claimed as its own but does not fully control, and formally renounce plans to join NATO.

Kyiv swiftly rejected the conditions as tantamount to surrender.

*   Summary

*   Trump meets Putin on Friday to discuss war in Ukraine
*   Trump praises call with Zelenskiy, European leaders
*   Macron says no territorial swap schemes on table
*   Europe and Kyiv feared decisions being made over their heads
*   Russia says its war aims remain unchanged

WASHINGTON/BERLIN, Aug 13 (Reuters) - U.S. There will be very severe consequences."

But the president also described the aim of the meeting between the two leaders in Alaska as "setting the table" for a quick follow-up that would include Zelenskiy.

"If the first one goes okay, we'll have a quick second one," Trump said.

"I would like to do it almost immediately, and we'll have a quick second meeting between President Putin and President Zelenskiy and myself, if they'd like to have me there."

Trump did not provide a time frame for a second meeting.

RED LINES
---------

European leaders and Zelenskiy had earlier spoken with Trump in a last-ditch call hosted by Germany to lay out red lines ahead of the Alaska meeting.

"We had a very good call. I would rate it a 10, very friendly," Trump said.

French President Emmanuel Macron said Trump agreed Ukraine must be involved in any discussions about ceding land, while Zelenskiy said Trump had supported the idea of security guarantees in a post-war settlement.

"President Trump was very clear that the United States wanted to achieve a ceasefire at this meeting in Alaska," Macron said.

"The second point on which things were very clear, as expressed by President Trump, is that territories belonging to Ukraine cannot be negotiated and will only be negotiated by the Ukrainian president."

Item 1 of 6 rench President Emmanuel Macron, Antonio Costa, President of the European Council, French Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs Jean-Noel Barrot, and France's Minister of Armed Forces Sebastien Lecornu attend a video conference with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz to discuss the ongoing war in Ukraine, at Fort de Bregancon in Bormes-les-Mimosas, France, 13 August 2025. He shares it very extensively and therefore I can say: We have had a really exceptionally constructive and good conversation with each other."

Trump and Putin are due to discuss how to end the three-and-a-half-year-old [conflict](https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraine-russia-war/)
, the largest in Europe since World War Two. Trump has previously said both sides will have to swap land to end fighting that has cost tens of thousands of lives and displaced millions.

RUSSIA MAKES SHARP ADVANCE INTO UKRAINE
---------------------------------------

On a day of intense diplomacy, Zelenskiy flew to Berlin for the virtual conferences with European leaders and then with Trump.

He and the Europeans worry that a land swap could leave Russia with almost a fifth of Ukraine, rewarding it for nearly 11 years of efforts to seize Ukrainian land, the last three in all-out war, and embolden Putin to expand further west.

Russian forces have made a sharp thrust into eastern Ukraine in recent days in what may be an attempt to increase the pressure on Kyiv to give up territory.

"I told the U.S. Russia is trying to show that it can occupy all of Ukraine."

A source familiar with the matter said the call with Trump discussed possible cities that could host a three-way meeting, depending on the outcome of the talks in Alaska.

Wary of angering Trump, European leaders have repeatedly said they welcome his efforts, while stressing that there should be no deal without Ukraine's participation.

Trump's agreement last week to the summit was an abrupt shift after weeks of voicing frustration with Putin for resisting the U.S. PHILIPPE MAGONI/Pool via Reuters

A video claiming that USAID, the US government's main overseas aid agency, has paid Hollywood celebrities millions of dollars to visit Ukraine has gone viral on social media and has been amplified by high-profile accounts like Elon Musk.

However, the clip is not real and has hallmarks of a Russian disinformation operation that the BBC has previously investigated.

BBC Verify's Olga Robinson explains why.

The BBC Verify division [identified the fake video](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0m12wl0jwpo)

Stars mentioned in the video to have received payments included Angelina Jolie, Sean Pean, Jean Claude Van Dam, Orlando Bloom and Ben Stiller.

!BATH, UNITED KINGDOM - NOVEMBER 06: In this photo illustration the profile page of tech billionaire Elon Musk and owner of US online social media and social networking site 'X' (formerly known as Twitter) is displayed on November 6, 2024 in Bath, England. (Photo by Anna Barclay/Getty Images)

A post [shared on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=3936628693283593&id=100008095036730)
 claims billionaire Elon Musk posted a “last dollar” for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

**Verdict: False**

There is no evidence that Musk posted this.

**Fact Check:**

Musk joined President-elect Donald Trump on his phone call with Zelenskyy, according to [The Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-ukraine-elon-musk-zelenskyy-starlink-f6ab0c5e1c5de1262ae2a1747247819c)
. Musk has become a part of Trump’s inner circle, the outlet reported.

Social media users are claiming that Musk posted that Zelenskyy had received his “last dollar.” These claims show an image of a purported tweet from Musk, which states, “The last dollar for Zelenskiy” and is accompanied by a dollar with Trump in the middle.

These claims are false. 6 tweet.

“The tweet attributed to Elon Musk about the alleged ‘last dollar for Zelenskyy’ featuring a bill with Donald Trump’s portrait is fake. This is fabricated content intended for manipulation and provocation,” reads the tweet.

 this claim, saying that Ukrainian and Russian Telegram channels spread the fake image, though noted the Ukrainian channels said it was satire.

From [Source](https://www.politico.eu/article/billionaire-elon-musk-mocks-ukraine-president-zelenskyy-asking-aid-with-meme/): 
Content: "[Skip to main content](#main)

Billionaire entrepreneur [Elon Musk mocked Ukraine’s war-time leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1708629197617336398)
 on Monday, using a meme to scoff at the president’s calls for Western aid.

“When it’s been 5 min and you haven’t asked for a billion dollars in aid,” read Musk’s message, which accompanied Zelenskyy’s head attached to a famous photo of an agitated schoolboy, who — according to the [meme’s etymology](https://medium.com/@tazreen.noman/the-origin-of-michael-mcgee-vein-popping-guy-ad41c63190f0)
 — was in a classroom and desperately trying to hold in flatulence.

Musk has had a troubled relationship with Ukrainians and the country’s administration since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion in February 2022, but now they’ve had just about enough of the SpaceX chief and owner of X (formerly Twitter).

“So you have bought social media to bully people who are dying because \[they\] love freedom,” Ukrainian stand-up comedian Anton Tymoshenko [wrote](https://twitter.com/_Tymoshenko/status/1708716338196214196)
 in response to Musk’s post.

“Elon, did you write this meme during a friendly conversation with Putin on the phone?” another Ukrainian comic and volunteer, Vasyl Baydak, [wrote](https://twitter.com/by_by_duck/status/1708711638268878922)
 — alluding to a [New Yorker report](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/08/28/elon-musks-shadow-rule)
 that Musk and the Russian president spoke directly.

Even Ukrainian media organizations joined the anti-Musk revolt, with top publication Ukrainska Pravda [posting](https://twitter.com/pravda_eng/status/1708732658182701406?s=20)
 the same meme, but with Musk’s face photoshopped in, saying: “When’s it’s been 5 minutes and you haven’t spread Russian propaganda.”

Zelenskyy has not yet reacted to Musk’s post. But that narrative flipped after he began spreading what Ukraine said was [pro-Russian propaganda](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/03/ukrainian-officials-and-allies-rail-against-elon-musk-tweet-00060085)
 via his social media.

According to a new biography of the tech boss, Musk also secretly ordered his engineers to [disable Starlink satellite](https://www.politico.eu/article/elon-musk-ukraine-starlink-russia-crimea-war-drone-submarine-attack-sabotage/)
 communications near the coast of Russian-occupied Crimea last year to sabotage a planned Ukrainian drone strike.

Last week, the [European Commission slammed Musk’s X](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_NCu44_Xc0)
 as the social media platform which is the biggest source of disinformation. President Joe Biden [signed](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/09/30/biden-administration-congress-government-shutdown-deal-ukraine-aid-00119296)
 a temporary budget bill featuring no Ukraine aid to avert the American government’s shutdown.

Shortly after Putin’s assault on Kyiv began last year, Musk was hailed in Ukraine thanks to his early decision to provide Starlink satellite internet for the country. But one of his office advisers, Serhiy Leshchenko, hit back [in a tweet](https://twitter.com/Leshchenkos/status/1708720295681421701)
 accusing Musk of “trolling.”

Musk’s meme comes shortly after U.S."

**_UNITED24_** **did not report such information, and neither did any other credible source.**

Ukraine has found an alternative to the American satellite system Starlink, a number of pro-Russian sources [report](https://archive.ph/JTBdd)
 citing _UNITED24_. At the same time while commenting on this decision communications officer Ruslana Danilkina allegedly spoke obscenely about Elon Musk in the context of his recent comments about Ukraine.

! On her [personal page](https://www.instagram.com/rusya_danilkina/)
, she also did not publish any offensive comments about Elon Musk, and did not comment on this news invented by propagandists.

For now, Ukraine continues to use the Starlink system, despite the tensions in relations with the United States. They had previously used the _UNITED24_ brand identity to spread the fake that [eight villas of Ukrainian generals burned down in Los Angeles.](https://www.stopfake.org/en/fake-eight-villas-belonging-to-ukrainian-generals-burned-down-in-los-angeles/)

And secondly, Ruslana Danilkina, who was called a communications officer in the video, does not actually currently hold combat positions in the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Electronic warfare equipment manufacturer and former Air Force officer Anatoly Khrapchinsky [considers](https://www.unian.ua/war/starlink-hrapchinskiy-poyasniv-chi-maye-ukrajina-alternativu-suputnikovomu-zv-yazku-12932037.html)
 the Starlink shutdown unlikely: _«Both Trump and Musk are about money. That’s why they won’t give up multibillion-dollar, multimillion-dollar contracts."

This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing.

Social-media users viewed the viral footage of the burning Aurus Senat car, which is believed to be worth around $350,000. The incident took place near the headquarters of Russia's main intelligence agency, the FSB, according to reports.

_Newsweek_ has contacted the Kremlin for comment.

Newsweek AI is in beta. The cause of the fire is not known, and it is not clear whether the vehicle had been personally used by Putin, but the Russian leader has reportedly displayed paranoia about assassination plots.

What To Know
------------

The Aurus limousine blew up on Sretenka Street just north of the FSB headquarters in Lubyanka on Saturday night, with video footage showing the fire spreading to the vehicle's interior.

Onlookers can be seen watching back smoke billowing out of the front of the destroyed vehicle, and the rear of the car also seemed to be damaged.

It is not clear who was using the car, but it is said to be owned by Putin's Presidential Property Management Department, British newspaper _The Sun_ reported. The independent Russian language outlet Meduza [said that Putin](https://www.newsweek.com/putin-decries-massive-blunder-after-top-general-assassinated-2003548)
 had called the incident a major security lapse.

Video from Putin's visit last week to the Arctic city of Murmansk showed servicemen from a ceremonial guard being patted down for hidden weapons or explosive devices before the president came to lay a wreath by the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.

What People Are Saying
----------------------

**_The Sun_ newspaper wrote:** "An Aurus limousine from Putin's 'official car fleet' blew up in a huge blast on a street just north of Moscow's FSB secret service headquarters in Lubyanka."

**Ukrainian X user Devana posted:** "Not just Russia is burning—even Putin's limo went boom. So hey, Vladimir—if even your car goes up in flames next to FSB HQ … maybe the system's cracking from within?"

What Happens Next
-----------------

Official comment about the car blast is unlikely, but security around Putin will continue to dominate headlines. [Russia's special services have ramped up](https://www.newsweek.com/putin-spending-personal-security-russia-ukraine-arrest-warrant-icc-1803885)
 the [already-strict security measures](https://www.newsweek.com/putin-bulletproof-vest-armor-public-events-security-1908361)
 surrounding the Russian leader to an unprecedented degree, unnamed Russian and Kremlin officials told _The Moscow Times_ in June 2024.

The video of the alleged explosion has gone viral on social media, leading to speculation of an assassination attempt on the Russian leader
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A £275,000 Aurus Senat limousine, believed to be from Russian President Vladimir Putin's official car fleet, reportedly exploded and caught fire on a street in Moscow near the country's top intelligence agency FSB's headquarters.

 ![A huge volume of smoke was seen flowing out of the vehicle, in which the front portion is also believed to have been damaged in the incident.(HT File)](https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/03/30/550x309/KWHEVD2_1708605928909_1743298840432.jpg "A huge volume of smoke was seen flowing out of the vehicle, in which the front portion is also believed to have been damaged in the incident.(HT File)")

The incident is said to have taken place on March 29 on a street north of Moscow’s FSB headquarters, located near the Lubyanka, according to EuroWeekly.

A purported video of the alleged explosion has gone viral on social media, leading to speculation of an assassination attempt on the Russian leader amid talks backed by the United States to end Moscow's war in Ukraine.

In the viral video, workers from nearby establishments could be seen helping to extinguish the fire, which is believed to have started from the car's engine bay area and spread to its interiors.

### Watch the viral video here

Thick smoke was seen flowing out of the vehicle, whose front portion is also believed to have been damaged in the incident.

It was not immediately clear who was present in the car during the incident, as no injuries were reported, according to The Sun.

It is suspected that the fire started in the car’s engine and quickly engulfed the entire vehicle, EuroWeekly reported.

### **Ukraine war**

Ukrainian government and military analysts speaking to AP expected Russia to launch a fresh offensive across the 1,000-kilometer front line to strengthen its negotiating position ahead of potential talks with Kyiv.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia is getting ready for new offensives in the northeastern regions.

Putin escapes assassination bid? stuck in endless and pointless discussions about fake ‘conditions’ just to buy time and then try to grab more land,” Zelenskyy said Thursday in a visit to Paris.

The two sides have stepped up their aerial attacks even as US President Donald Trump pushes them to agree to a ceasefire after more than three years of intense fighting.

Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of breaching commitments to not strike energy facilities.

Zelensky also rejected Putin's idea of a “transitional administration”, backed by the United Nations, in Ukraine and said it was Putin's latest ploy to delay a peace deal.

Newsweek reports that a limousine from Vladimir Putin's presidential fleet caught fire near the FSB headquarters in Moscow (<image:5183>), as reported in [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/russia-putin-limousine-fire-video-2052846).

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that one of Vladimir Putin's official limousines exploded in Moscow. However, the reports do not confirm that Putin was in the car at the time of the explosion, nor do they confirm his death.

The Hindustan Times mentions speculation of an assassination attempt, but it was not immediately clear who was in the car and no injuries were reported. The Economic Times also raises security concerns.

Therefore, the claim that Vladimir Putin has died in an explosion in one of his limousines is not supported by the evidence. The evidence only confirms an explosion involving one of his limousines.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

FSWC Calls for Canadians to Stand with Israel

### News Release

‍

**Statement from FSWC**

**Toronto (October 7, 2023)** - Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center (FSWC) is devastated by today’s horrific news from Israel concerning the many Israelis killed or wounded in the murderous, multi-front assault by Hamas terrorists.

We extend our condolences and deepest sympathies to the families of those killed in this abhorrent, unprovoked attack on civilians. We express our wishes for a full and speedy recovery to those wounded and pray for the safe return of all those kidnapped and taken to Gaza as hostages by the Hamas invaders.

We condemn, in the harshest terms, the actions of Palestinian terror groups in firing thousands of rockets indiscriminately at civilian targets in Israel and massacring residents in numerous villages and towns, actions that constitute heinous war crimes that shouldn’t go unpunished.

FSWC thanks senior police officials in Toronto, York and Peel regions after they informed us that they have devoted additional resources to ensure the safety and security of Jewish residents and Jewish community institutions given the antisemitic attacks that took place two years ago in Toronto during the last major conflict between Israel and Palestinian terror groups in Gaza.

**FSWC President and CEO Michael Levitt issued the following statement:**

“We appreciate the strong support for Israel already expressed by leaders in our country, including the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and many others at all levels of government and many community organizations. We call on all Canadians to stand in solidarity with Israel, to unequivocally condemn today’s appalling attacks against Israelis and to speak out against the actions of the Palestinian terrorists and those who support them, including their backers in Iran.”

The administration of US President Donald Trump has warned that its military campaign will continue until the Yemeni group halts all firings against vessels in the Red Sea,  a major conduit for international trade.

The Houthis have rejected the US assault, stressing that they are targeting ships in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza and will stop when Israel ends its punishing war on the enclave.

The latest attack comes just days after 12 people were killed in air strikes conducted by the US on Yemen’s capital Sanaa.

Last week, the [US launched 13 strikes](/news/2025/4/19/us-attacks-yemen-again-after-at-least-80-people-killed-in-hodeidah)
 on Hodeidah’s port and airport. It was three days after its deadliest attack to date targeted the Ras Isa port, also in Hodeidah, killing at least 80 people and wounding more than 150 others.

Since November 2023, the Houthis have reportedly launched more than 100 attacks on vessels they say are linked to Israel, in response to [Israel’s war on Gaza](/news/liveblog/2025/4/20/live-israel-kills-52-in-gaza-netanyahu-orders-army-to-step-up-attacks)
.

The group halted attacks on shipping lanes during a two-month ceasefire in Gaza earlier this year."

Yemen’s Houthi armed group has shot down seven US [Reaper drones](/news/2025/4/22/houthis-say-group-downed-us-drone-in-northwest-yemen-as-us-strikes-continue)
 worth more than $200m in recent weeks, marking the most significant material loss yet in Washington’s campaign against the fighters.

The drones were destroyed between March 31 and April 22, according to defence officials, as the Houthis step up efforts to target United States aircraft operating over Yemen.

end of list

Three of the drones were lost in the past week alone, suggesting an improvement in the Houthis’ ability to strike high-altitude US aircraft.

The drones – each costing about $30m – were conducting surveillance or attack missions when they crashed into water or land. This claim could not be independently verified.

Another US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the drone losses are under investigation but are likely the result of hostile fire, the AP reported.

The Houthis have targeted mainly Israeli, US and British ships passing through the Bab al-Mandeb Strait in protest against Israel’s war on Gaza. The group believes the toll in April is already considerably higher, though full figures remain unconfirmed.

Earlier this month, a [US air strike](/news/2025/4/18/more-than-30-killed-80-injured-in-us-air-strikes-on-yemen-report)
 targeted the Ras Isa port, also in Hodeidah, killing at least 80 people and wounding more than 150.

This was followed by another attack on Monday, which killed 12 people and wounded more than 30 others in Yemen’s capital Sanaa.

Concerns are growing in Washington over the human cost of the campaign.

Senators Chris Van Hollen, Elizabeth Warren and Tim Kaine have written to Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, questioning whether the administration is abandoning its responsibility to reduce civilian harm, particularly after reports emerged about the high civilian death toll on the Ras Isa fuel terminal.

aj-logo A defence official said the strikes occurred on March 31 and on April 3, 9, 13, 18, 19 and 22, according to The Associated Press news agency.

Dozens of civilians have been reported killed in Houthi-controlled parts of Yemen since March 15 after US President Donald Trump ordered daily strikes against the group.

Central Command spokesperson Dave Eastburn said on Thursday that US forces have struck more than 800 targets, destroying command centres, weapons depots and air defences, and killing hundreds of Houthi fighters and leaders. The group has said the attacks would stop if Israel agreed to a permanent ceasefire.

Mounting civilian death toll
----------------------------

The Trump administration appears to have shifted from targeting only infrastructure to deliberately striking figures within the Houthi movement.

The strategic change comes amid rising civilian casualties from the US-led campaign, [according to Airwars](https://trump-yemen.airwars.org/)
, a UK-based monitoring group.

Airwars estimates that between 27 and 55 civilians were killed in US strikes during March."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:20>

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Wikipedia article discusses the March–May 2025 United States attacks in Yemen, mentioning that the Houthis shot down a US MQ-9 Reaper drone in March 2025. The Military Times reported on April 25, 2025, that Houthi rebels had shot down seven U.S. Reaper drones in recent weeks. Al Jazeera reported on April 22, 2025, that the Houthis claimed to have shot down a US drone in Yemen.

The sources are: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March%E2%80%93May_2025_United_States_attacks_in_Yemen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March%E2%80%93May_2025_United_States_attacks_in_Yemen), [https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2025/04/25/houthi-rebels-have-shot-down-7-us-reaper-drones-in-recent-weeks/](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2025/04/25/houthi-rebels-have-shot-down-7-us-reaper-drones-in-recent-weeks/) and [https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/22/houthis-say-group-downed-us-drone-in-northwest-yemen-as-us-strikes-continue](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/22/houthis-say-group-downed-us-drone-in-northwest-yemen-as-us-strikes-continue). <image:20>


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the Houthis shot down US drones in March 2025. However, the provided evidence does not contain any information about the image itself. Therefore, it is impossible to verify whether the image depicts a US drone shot down by the Houthis.

The claim is missing information about the image's origin and context.

Content: "One user wrote, “A photo of the wreckage of the American MQ-9 drone that was shot down by Yemeni air defenses in Dhamar Governorate.”

Through a reverse image search, Check Your Fact found that the image is from May 2024, not March 2025. The image was shared by a [pro-Russian outlet](https://anna-news.info/husity-sbili-amerikanskij-bpla-mq-9-reaper/)
 that claims the Houthis shot down the drone in Marib Governorate, which is different from Dhamar.

Check Your Fact could not find any recent claims from the Houthis themselves that they shot down an MQ-9 drone in the Dhamar Governorate, though an outlet did [report](https://x.com/AlMayadeenLive/status/1902475316540354893)
 that the group shot down an MQ-9 on March 19 in the region. It appears to be from a different location in Yemen than the one cited in the Instagram post.

**Fact Check:**

Social media users are claiming to show an MQ-9 drone shot down by Houthi forces in Dhamar Governorate in March 2025. **[(RELATED: Did Vice President JD Vance Say Elon Musk Is ‘Making Us Look Bad?’)](https://checkyourfact.com/2025/03/24/fact-check-vice-president-vance-musk-look-bad/)
**

The group did claim on March 3 that they shot down an MQ-9 drone in Al Hudaydah Governorate, with Star & Stripes [reporting](https://www.stripes.com/theaters/middle_east/2025-03-05/reaper-drone-houthis-red-sea-17044640.html)
 that a U.S. official told the outlet that they lost contact with a drone the same day.

“Scenes of the downing of the American MQ9 drone with a locally-made surface-to-air missile while carrying out hostile missions in the airspace of Al Hudaydah Governorate – 03/03/2025 AD,” reads the tweet from the Houthis.

The devastating Russian-Ukrainian war has been ongoing for several years, with the United States and NATO providing support to Ukraine. A report can be read [here](https://tass.com/russia/1728697)
. 

**Clarification:**

Peskov’s Comments: It is important to note that Peskov’s remarks about the United States being an “enemy” were part of a broader narrative criticizing American policies and actions towards Russia. The confusion may stem from a recent shift in Russian officials’ rhetoric amid ongoing tensions over the Ukraine conflict.

**Background:**

**Recent Statements by Russian Officials:** Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov referred to the United States as an “enemy” state in a recent press interaction. More details can be read [here](https://www.trtworld.com/us-and-canada/russia-formally-declares-the-us-as-enemy-what-next-18170984)
.

**Misinterpretation**: Peskov’s statement, “We are now an enemy country for them, just as they are for us,” has been misinterpreted on social media as a declaration of war. This is a significant escalation from the term “unfriendly states” that Russian officials have used previously to describe the United States and its allies.

**Context**: Peskov’s comments followed actions by the Biden administration, allowing Ukraine to use American-supplied weapons to attack targets within Russia. In this context, a significant amount of misleading information regarding the situation is being spread on social media.

**Social Media Posts** 

Social media posts claim that Russia has declared war against the USA.

! Details can be read [here](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy770l9llnzo)
. 

**Historical Rhetoric:** Russian President Vladimir Putin has previously referred to the Western countries’ elites as Russia’s enemies while characterizing Ukraine as a tool used by the West. The rhetoric from Russian officials reflects escalating tensions but does not amount to a declaration of war. Social media users should be cautious about misinterpreting or amplifying such statements without verifying the facts through reliable sources.

Ukrainians sought shelter in underground shelters as Russian forces attacked on 24 February 2022

Launching the biggest European invasion since the end of World War Two, Putin gave a fiery speech on TV declaring his goal was to "demilitarise and denazify" Ukraine.

Russia has repeatedly painted modern Ukraine as a Nazi state, in a crass distortion of history.

Putin had already seized Ukraine's Crimean peninsula eight years earlier, after a revolution that ousted Ukraine's pro-Russian president and replaced him with a more pro-Western government.

Putin then triggered a lower-level war in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, with pro-Russian proxy forces occupying territory and setting up rebel states supported by Moscow.

But the 2022 invasion was on a different scale.

Putin had just [recognised the rebel states as independent](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-europe-60470900)
. He has spoken of the Ukrainian leader's "illegitimacy" - a false narrative that has also been repeated by President Trump.

As evidence Putin cites the postponement of Ukraine's March 2024 presidential election, although it is because of Russia's war that Ukraine is under martial law and elections are barred under the constitution.

Putin's own re-election in 2024 is highly questionable, as Russia's opposition leaders are either in exile or dead.

Was Nato expansion to blame for the war?
----------------------------------------

Putin has for years complained about Nato's eastward expansion as a security threat, and sees any possibility of Ukraine joining the alliance as a major red line.

Before Russia's 2022 invasion he demanded that Nato remove multinational deployments from the Central and Eastern European states that joined the Western alliance after 1997.

But it was Russia that launched military action in Eastern Europe, when it invaded Georgia in 2008 and then Crimea in 2014.

After the Crimea invasion, Nato established a continuous presence on its eastern flank - closest to Russia.

Nato has always stressed the whole purpose of the alliance is to defend territories "with no aggressive intentions". <image:2680>!A map showing the expansion of Nato over time <image:2687>

Zelensky said as much two weeks into the invasion: "Nato is not prepared to accept Ukraine."

He has since said he would consider resigning in exchange for Nato membership, but Trump says Kyiv should "forget about" joining the Western alliance.

Putin has accused Nato of participating in the war, because its member states have increasingly sent Ukraine military hardware, including tanks and fighter jets, air defence systems, missile systems, artillery and drones.

Nato has provided security assistance and training to Ukraine, but it insists that does not make it a party to the war.

Putin's grievance against Nato dates back to 1990, when he claims the West promised not to expand "an inch to the East".

However that was before the Soviet Union collapsed and it was based on a limited commitment made to then Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.

Gorbachev said "the topic of Nato expansion was never discussed" at the time.

How could the war end?
----------------------

The most likely route is through direct talks, although previous rounds of negotiations between the two sides made little progress on a ceasefire.

After a fifth visit to Moscow by Trump envoy Steve Witkoff on 6 August, the US president said a there was a "good chance" he could meet the Russian and Ukrainian leaders for talks in person.

The Kremlin also said a Trump-Putin meeting would happen in the coming days, but Putin ruled out an imminent meeting with Zelensky, saying the right conditions were not in place.

So far though, the two sides have been unable to find a way of bridging their differences.

Russia wants direct talks to address the "root causes of the conflict", a phrase that harks back to Putin's "maximalist" demands at the start of the war in March 2022.

These included Ukraine becoming a neutral state, dramatically reducing its military and abandoning its Nato aspirations.

Russia also wants international recognition of its territorial gains in Ukraine reflected in any future deal, including annexation of Crimea and four eastern regions. <image:2680>!Reuters Vladimir Putin remembering Russia's victory over Nazi Germany wears a long coat as soldiers pass him by carrying swords <image:2689>Reuters

Vladimir Putin has made repeated false allegations of genocide and Nazi taunts against Ukraine

At the start of the 2022 invasion, Putin vowed to protect people in occupied areas of eastern Ukraine from eight years of Ukrainian "bullying and genocide, during the war in the east.

More than 14,000 people died on both sides of the front line between 2014-2022, but Russian claims of Ukrainian Nazis committing genocide in the occupied regions never added up, and no international body has spoken of genocide. It abandoned its nuclear weapons in 1994 in return for guaranteed security from Russia, the UK and US which Moscow failed to respect.

Since the war, many Ukrainians have turned their back on Russian, and Zelensky himself avoids using the language in public.

When Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered up to 200,000 soldiers into Ukraine, his aim was to sweep into the capital, Kyiv, in days, overthrow its pro-Western government and return Ukraine to Russia's sphere of influence.

Putin failed but, more than three years on, a fifth of Ukrainian territory is in Russian hands.

US President Donald Trump has been trying to negotiate a peace deal and the Kremlin says Putin will meet Trump "in the coming days". Last year he told US TV talk show host Tucker Carlson that Ukraine was an "artificial state".

Those comments have led many to believe that the goal of the invasion was in effect to erase the state of Ukraine.

Russia's state-run Ria news agency explained that "denazification is inevitably also de-Ukrainisation" - seemingly tying the idea of erasing Ukraine to the stated goal of the invasion.

Ukrainian culture and identity have in fact existed for centuries independently of Russia.

Does Putin want to get rid of Zelensky?
---------------------------------------

! <image:2680>!Getty Images The president of Ukraine holds his hands out, flanked by two Ukrainian flags <image:2685>Getty Images

Volodymyr Zelensky was elected president in Ukraine in 2019

Putin has long sought to get rid of Ukraine's elected pro-Western president, and Zelensky was apparently a target from the very start of the war.

Russian troops made two attempts to storm the presidential compound soon after the invasion, according to Zelensky's adviser, and Ukraine's elected leader said they wanted him dead.

"The enemy has designated me as target number one; my family is target number two.

"[They want to destroy Ukraine politically](https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/zvernennya-prezidenta-do-ukrayinciv-naprikinci-pershogo-dnya-73149)
 by destroying the head of state."

Zelensky said later that Putin had initially tried to replace him with the wealthy head of a pro-Russian party, Viktor Medvedchuk, who was accused of treason in Ukraine and is now in Russia.

Even now, Putin has not agreed to peace talks with Zelensky and his officials call him a "loser" and a "clown". It will also look for Western security guarantees to ensure Russia never invades its territory again.

Was Zelensky to blame for the war?
----------------------------------

Before his return to the White House and in the first months of his presidency, Trump suggested Ukraine's president was responsible for the war with Russia.

"\[Zelensky\] should never have let the war start, that war's a loser," he said in October 2024.

In reality, the war began in 2014, when Putin seized Crimea and Russian proxies grabbed part of eastern Ukraine. Putin then ordered Russia's full-scale invasion eight years later, after months of meticulous co-ordination and denials of any such plan.

However, the US president's messaging has not been altogether consistent, and in recent weeks his position appears to have hardened against Russia.

"We thought we had \[the war\] settled numerous times, and then President Putin goes out and starts launching rockets into some city like Kyiv and kills a lot of people," he said last month.

Trump has announced sweeping new secondary tariffs on any country still trading with Russia if a ceasefire with Ukraine is not agreed by Friday, 8 August.

Do Putin's claims on Nazis and genocide stack up?

From [Source](https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/what-putin-fears-most/): 
Content: "After each of them—Serbia in 2000, Georgia in 2003, Ukraine in 2004, the Arab Spring in 2011, Russia in 2011–12, and Ukraine in 2013–14—Putin has pivoted to more hostile policies toward the United States, and then invoked the NATO threat as justification for doing so.

Boris Yeltsin never supported NATO expansion but acquiesced to the first round of expansion in 1997 because he believed that his close ties to President Bill Clinton and the United States were not worth sacrificing over this comparatively smaller matter. Following John Mearsheimer’s provocative 2014 _Foreign Affairs_ article arguing that “the Ukraine crisis is the West’s fault,” the narrative of Russian backlash against NATO expansion has become a dominant framework for explaining—if not justifying—Moscow’s ongoing war against Ukraine.[1](#f1)
 This notion has been repeated not only in Moscow but in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere by politicians, analysts, and writers. By this telling, the specter of Ukraine’s NATO membership points both to the cause of the conflict and its solution: Take membership off the table for Ukraine, so the argument goes, and future wars will be prevented.

### Michael McFaul

_**Michael McFaul**, former U.S. If NATO was _always_ a threat to Russia and its “sphere of influence,” why did Putin facilitate the opening of these bases in the former Soviet Union?

During his November 2001 visit to the United States, Putin struck a realistic but cooperative tone:

> We differ in the ways and means we perceive that are suitable for reaching the same objective . Putin blamed the United States directly for assisting this democratic breakthrough and helping to install someone whom he saw as a pro-American puppet, President Mikheil Saakashvili. Since the Revolution of Dignity, Putin has waged an unprecedented assault against Ukraine’s democracy using a full spectrum of military, political, informational, social, and economic weapons in an attempt to destabilize and eventually topple Ukraine’s democratically elected government.[18](#f18)
 Ukraine’s relationship with NATO and the United States was just a symptom of what Putin believes is the underlying disease: a sovereign, democratic Ukraine.

Fact Crescendo states that there has been no official declaration of war by Russia against the USA, and the claim is unfounded (<image:2675>). The BBC article discusses the war in Ukraine and Putin's goals, including "demilitarise and denazify" Ukraine, and mentions that Putin has not agreed to peace talks with Zelensky (<image:2683>, <image:2687>, <image:2689>, <image:2681>, <image:2685>). The Journal of Democracy article discusses Putin's hostile policies towards the United States and invokes the NATO threat as justification, stating that Putin's real "casus belli" is Ukrainian democracy (<image:2694>).

The sources are: [https://srilanka.factcrescendo.com/english/did-russia-declare-war-against-the-usa/](https://srilanka.factcrescendo.com/english/did-russia-declare-war-against-the-usa/), [https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj0q964851po](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj0q964851po), and [https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/what-putin-fears-most/](https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/what-putin-fears-most/).


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the claim is false. Fact Crescendo explicitly states that there has been no official declaration of war by Russia against the USA. While the BBC article discusses the war in Ukraine and Putin's goals, it does not mention any declaration of war against the United States. The Journal of Democracy article discusses Putin's hostile policies towards the United States but does not mention a declaration of war.


## Final Judgement
The evidence from multiple sources confirms that there has been no declaration of war by Russia against the United States. Therefore, the claim is demonstrably false.

`false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim that Vladimir Putin declared war on the United States is false. According to [Fact Crescendo](https://srilanka.factcrescendo.com/english/did-russia-declare-war-against-the-usa/), there has been no official declaration of war. Other sources, such as the [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj0q964851po) and the [Journal of Democracy](https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/what-putin-fears-most/), discuss related geopolitical events but do not support the claim.

Clips of Hegseth calling Vladimir Putin a "war criminal" appeared online after he was nominated as secretary of defense by President-elect Donald Trump. Think about it through the psychology of him."

The Facts

While Hegseth aligned with the claim that Putin was a "war criminal," the clip shared online was from March 2022 not long after the outbreak of the conflict.

Since then Hegseth has been more cautious, and critical of the U.S. spending on the conflict, claims appeared on social media repeating comments Hegseth had made criticizing Russian President [Vladimir Putin](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/vladimir-putin)
 in bold terms.

!Pete Hegseth <image:2703>

Pete Hegseth on May 31, 2019, in New York City. intervention in Ukraine and the prognosis from others that Russia's intervention would lead to wider conflict.

In an episode of the _Shawn Ryan Show_ Podcast from November 2024, Hegseth said he did not see Putin taking the world into a wider global or nuclear conflict, saying his gains would be incremental, part of what he called a "get my s\*\*\* back" conflict.

"I found it overinflated from the beginning this idea that Vladimir Putin's attack on Ukraine was going to lead to nuclear war or war across the continent," Hegseth said.

"I've always felt like it was from the beginning, like a couple days in, I like, this feels like the Putin's 'give me my s\*\*\* back' war.

"It kind of feels like \[Putin thought\] 'I feel like you've been pushing pretty hard, and we used to have the former Soviet Union, and we're pretty proud of that, and Ukraine was a part of it, and all these other... I think he probably knows enough to know that it's probably not going much further than Ukraine.

"And I don't think he's a suicidal maniac who's hell-bent on bringing in armageddon with nuclear warfare."

Elsewhere, he has also defended Trump's comment in 2022 calling Putin "very savvy" after the Russian president announced Moscow's recognition of the independence of [two self-proclaimed republics](https://www.newsweek.com/blinken-says-swift-response-needed-russia-recognizing-new-republics-1681212)
 in eastern Ukraine.

While the White House and the [EU](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/eu)
 described Putin's actions as a violation of international law and a pretext for an invasion, Trump said [Putin's move was "genius" and "very savvy."](https://www.newsweek.com/trump-calls-putin-moving-troops-ukraine-peacekeeping-genius-1681557)

Hegseth defended the comments saying that Trump was trying to tease the media for obsessing over the Russian leader

"Here's the reality, Vladimir Putin lives rent-free in the minds of our media, of the American media," Hegseth said.

"No organism, no entity has done more to spread Russian propaganda and to prop up the strawman that is Vladimir Putin than our very own media."

In a [Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/video/6320895317112)
 interview in February 2023 with South Carolina [Republican](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/republican)
 Representative [Nancy Mace](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/nancy-mace)
, Hegseth criticized the number of times President [Joe Biden](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/joe-biden)
 had visited Ukraine compared to the southern border of the U.S., and the "billions spent in Ukraine" suggesting he was ignoring "our problems at home."

He also asked "what do we get out of" the billions the U.S."

Trump this week suggested NATO enlargement provoked Russia to invade Ukraine, but Wicker didn't agree.

“There are good guys and bad guys in this war, and the Russians are the bad guys,” Wicker said. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth made a “rookie mistake” when he said a return to Ukraine’s pre-war borders was “unrealistic,” Senate Armed Services Chair Roger Wicker said Friday.

Hegseth on Thursday [pulled back some of the comments](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/13/hegseth-pull-back-00204088)
 he made about Ukraine a day earlier, where he said that NATO membership for Kyiv was off the table and that the country could not return to its internationally recognized borders. 

“Hegseth is going to be a great defense secretary, although he wasn’t my choice for the job,” the Mississippi Republican [told POLITICO on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference](https://www.politico.eu/politico-munich-security-conference-2025/)
. Wicker said he favors a firm posture with Moscow.

“Everybody knows … and people in the administration know you don't say before your first meeting what you will agree to and what you won't agree to,” Wicker said, adding that he was “puzzled” and “disturbed” by Hegseth’s comments.

President Donald Trump this week held a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on ending the war; Vice President JD Vance will meet in Munich Friday with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Hegseth wasn't freelancing. “But he made a rookie mistake in Brussels and he’s walked back some of what he said but not that line."

"I don’t know who wrote the speech — it is the kind of thing Tucker Carlson could have written, and Carlson is a fool," Wicker said, referring to the pro-Putin broadcaster.

Speaking to Jonathan Martin at the POLITICO Pub in the Munich conference, Wicker — a staunch Ukraine supporter — said he was “surprised” by Hegseth’s original comments and “heartened” that the new defense secretary had reversed course. Trump on Thursday said there was a "good possibility of ending that horrible, very bloody war." He also said it was not "practical" for Kyiv to join NATO and "unlikely" that Ukraine could return to its 2014 pre-invasion borders.

The direct talks between Trump and Putin have left European allies rattled that the EU and Ukraine could be sidelined in any peace deal.

Amid Trump’s talks with Putin, Wicker took a more hawkish stance that is in line with traditional Republican views. resolve, arguing that failing to arm Ukraine could force American troops into future wars.

On Friday, Wicker also called for the U.S."

 of Kentucky, one of three Republicans who voted against Hegseth’s confirmation, who warned, "America’s reputation is on the line."

McConnell, now chair of the panel overseeing defense funding, issued some of his strongest public criticism yet, questioning whether the United States would continue defending democratic allies against authoritarian threats.

He contrasted his stance — rooted in a Reagan-era commitment to global leadership — with Hegseth’s "America First" approach favored by many Trump supporters. "We don’t want a headline at the end of this conflict that says [Russia](https://kyivindependent.com/tag/russia/)

When asked who the aggressor in the three-year-old war is, [Hegseth](https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-bracing-for-painful-reduction-in-us-military-aid-after-hegseth-announces-cuts/)

An F-16 Fighting Falcon rests inside a warehouse near March Air Reserve Base after crashing on May 16, 2019. The missiles on board did not explode. The plane suffered a loss of hydraulic pressure, rendering the pilot unable to control the jet, the U.S. Air Force said April 23, 2020. (Courtesy of U.S. Air Force)

The U.S. Air Force has answered a questioned that burned in people’s minds as bystanders were hurriedly pushed back to safer locations several times and the 215 Freeway was closed after [the crash of an Air National Guard F-16 fighter jet](https://www.pressenterprise.com/2019/05/16/plane-crashes-near-march-air-reserve-base-215-freeway-shut-down/)
 near March Air Reserve Base in 2019:

Why didn’t the missiles aboard the Flying Falcon explode on impact?

The reason, the Air Force said this week, is that the ordnance attached to the F-16 during its intercept training mission were never armed.

“Aircraft flying this mission do fly with live ordnance. In order for the weapons to detonate, there are multiple conditions that must be met, including arming and launching of the weapon to complete the detonation sequences,” said Capt. Tisha J. Yates, an Air Force spokeswoman at Joint Base Langley-Eustis in Virginia.

The missiles were eventually removed from the jet as it sat in a warehouse on Opportunity Way near the Riverside-Moreno Valley border. They were trucked to nearby Ben Clark Training Center, [where they were destroyed in a controlled detonation](https://www.pressenterprise.com/2019/05/17/x-9/)
.

“The determination to move civilians away from the scene was a safety measure put in place by the incident commander on scene and in coordination with NORAD based on the hazards present until all munitions were secured,” Yates said in response to questions from this news organization, [which first reported the cause of the crash](https://www.pressenterprise.com/2020/04/23/hydraulic-failure-caused-f-16-to-crash-near-march-base-last-year-air-force-says/)
.

The F-16 was assigned to the 114th Fighter Wing at Joe Foss Field in South Dakota. The pilot was attached to the 144th Fighter Wing at March.

On May 16, 2019, the pilot was returning from the two-jet maneuvers about 120 miles east of March when he lost hydraulic pressure and therefore the ability to control the aircraft. At 3:39 p.m., after burning off fuel, he ejected about 250 feet off the ground less than a mile from the base. The pilot suffered minor injuries, as did about a dozen people in the warehouse where the plane crashed.

The Air Force concluded in its 22-page accident report that the $24 million jet lost the fluid from its two hydraulic tanks when two inlet check valves — each less than an inch tall — failed because they were improperly installed.

Each valve consists of a cap, screw threads, a retainer ring and an O-ring that collectively are referred to as a screw cap. That screw cap screws into the valve body. The retainer helps keep the O-ring in place. It is primarily the screw cap retainer and O-ring that prevent hydraulic fluid from leaking under high pressure.

The investigation determined that both screw caps were not properly screwed into the valve bodies. The retainers were found to be deformed, and portions of the O-rings were missing. As a result, hydraulic fluid leaked out through the threads between the screw caps and the valve bodies.

A suspected hydraulic leak had been noted in the jet in March 2019. A new flight-control system that had been overhauled months earlier was installed on March 28, and the plane flew 10 more missions without incident before the crash. The report concluded that the overhaul process lacked “an effective procedure to identify improper installation of ISA check valves.” ISA stands for Integrated Servo Actuator, a flight-control system.

In the wake of the crash, the Air Force also said this week that it studied the overhaul process and found a problem with how the inlet check valve was assembled during overhauls, said Derek Kaufman, a civilian spokesman for the Air Force Materiel Command at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio.

There are two approved configurations of the valves. The older configuration uses smaller Teflon backing rings, and newer configurations use larger rings. The team discovered the potential for installation of the wrong-size backing ring since both size rings were packaged side by side, Kaufman said.

As a result, the Air Force changed the process for assembling the valves during overhauls. It separated the installation and inspection steps on the work documentation and added a secondary quality check for just O-ring backing ring installation. And it inserted a “quality stamp” of the entire process for the first six months after the changes to ensure proper training was accomplished.

The Air Force also inspected all of its inlet check valves and found three to be defective. Those were fixed, Kaufman said.

“We review the facts for any lessons that can be applied to maintenance processes and training to improve the safety and quality of systems we deliver to our warfighters,” he said.

The improper installation of two parts caused an [F-16](/weapons/f-16/ "Learn more about the F-16 Fighting Falcon")
‘s hydraulic system to fail, making the pilot [lose control and crash into a warehouse in May 2019](https://www.airforcemag.com/f-16-crashes-during-norad-training-in-california/)
 while flying back to March Air Reserve Base, Calif., Air Force investigators found.

The F-16 pilot successfully ejected before the Viper crashed into the civilian building. The aircraft was destroyed at a loss of $24.99 million, and caused about $3.9 million in damage to the warehouse, according to an Air Combat Command Accident Investigation Board report.

The F-16C, tail number 88-0477 from the South Dakota Air National Guard’s 114th Fighter Wing, was operated by a pilot from the California Air National Guard’s 144th Fighter Wing Detachment 1 at March for homeland defense missions. On May 16, 2019, the F-16C took off as part of a two-ship formation for an aerospace control alert training mission in a nearby military operating area.

The two F-16s flew one-versus-one tactical intercepts, low-level proficiency training, and local area familiarization. While flying near Palm Springs, the pilot began receiving cockpit warnings of a potential hydraulic system issue with gauges showing low pressure and began going through appropriate checklists, according to the report.

About 20 miles from base, the pilot deployed speed brakes and lowered the landing gear to burn more fuel and let the wingman visually inspect the aircraft. With the speed brakes and gear deployed and locked, the pilot did not yet declare an emergency, but continued the approach to March, the report states.

The aircraft then indicated further loss of pressure in both of its “A and B” systems, and the pilot consulted checklists for dual hydraulic failure. Once they got close to the base, the wingman landed first on one of the base’s runways, allowing the damaged F-16 to land on a runway with an arresting cable.

With both hydraulic systems failing, the pilot declared an emergency and turned on emergency power as a precaution before starting a straight-in approach to the runway. About one mile before touching down, at about 300 feet above ground level, the F-16 began to roll to the left without any pilot input. The pilot tried to maintain control, and counter the roll, but the aircraft rolled hard to the right in a way that was inconsistent with the pilot’s input.

After losing control of the aircraft, the pilot ejected. Immediately after punching out, the F-16 crashed into the warehouse, located across a major highway from the base. A photograph of the impact shows the F-16’s nose sheared off and wings largely removed in a pile of boxes and equipment. The pilot parachuted onto the runway overrun at the base, and was briefly hospitalized with minor injuries.

The Accident Investigation Board found that the cause of the mishap was two improperly installed hydraulic check valves in the aircraft’s right flaperon integrated survoactuator—a part that translates electrical commands to the movement of flight control surfaces. For both of the parts that failed, investigators found the same problem: the retainer on a screw cap had deformed, with fragments tearing away allowing fluid to leak.

“This condition allowed hydraulic fluid to leak from both systems resulting in decreased hydraulic pressure to move flight control surfaces,” the report said. “The \[pilot\] set up to land as soon as possible, but the system had lost enough pressure on final approach to prevent the \[aircraft\] from sustaining controlled flight.”

Maintainers with the 144th Fighter Wing Detachment 1 installed the parts as part of unscheduled maintenance in March 2019 after a possible hydraulic leak was discovered. The parts went through operational checks with no discrepancies found, and the aircraft had flown 10 sorties for 16.3 hours before the crash. The AIB states that there was an inadequate overhaul process, which lacked an effective procedure to identify problems with the installation of the check valves.

A loss of hydraulic pressure prevented the pilot of the Air National Guard’s F-16 [that crashed near March Air Reserve Base](https://www.pe.com/2019/05/16/plane-crashes-near-march-air-reserve-base-215-freeway-shut-down/)
 last year from controlling the jet, the U.S. Air Force says in a report.

The pilot ejected and parachuted onto a base runway on May 16, 2019, suffering minor injuries. The $24 million Fighting Falcon plummeted through the roof of a warehouse, destroying the jet and causing a small fire.

Twelve people in the warehouse were treated for exposure to the debris, the Cal Fire/Riverside County Fire Department said at the time.

The 22-page report, dated April 14, said two inlet-check valves were improperly installed, resulting in damage to them that caused hydraulic fuel to leak.

The valves were part of a flight-control system that was overhauled in January 2019 and installed in the jet after a possible hydraulic leak was discovered several months later.

“The evidence also indicated an inadequate overhaul process that lacked an effective procedure to identify improper installation of ISA check valves,” the report says.

The F-16 was one of two jets initially practicing 120 miles east of March, which sits on the Riverside-Moreno Valley border. The planes were returning to March when the one jet lost hydraulic pressure.

The pilot burned off fuel before ejecting, the report says.

The F-16 was assigned to the 114th Fighter Wing at Joe Foss Field in South Dakota and ran some missions for the 144th Fighter Wing at March.

CNN  — 

A Ukrainian pilot was killed and his F-16 fighter jet crashed after Russia launched a huge aerial assault involving hundreds of drones and scores of missiles overnight, the Ukrainian military said on Sunday.

The airman, named as 1st Class Lt. Maksym Ustymenko by the Ukrainian air force, was the third F-16 pilot killed since the Ukrainians began flying the jets last summer, and his plane was the fourth F-16 Ukraine has lost since then.

The air force said Ustymenko “did everything he could to steer the aircraft away from a populated area, but he did not have time to eject.”

Ustymenko’s death is a major loss for Ukraine. But Kyiv is at risk of running out of missiles for these systems, as Trump continues to threaten withdrawing US aid from Ukraine.

The Ukrainian air force said Sunday it had downed 211 drones and 38 missiles launched by Moscow overnight. Only a small number of the country’s top pilots have been trained to fly F-16s, the most advanced of Ukraine’s fighter jets. The training is highly specialized and takes months to complete.

Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ustymenko destroyed seven targets before being killed, praising him and the Ukrainian air force for “heroically protecting” the country’s skies.

Zelensky said Moscow launched 477 drones and 60 missiles towards six different locations overnight into Sunday – one of Russia’s largest ever aerial assaults in terms of weapons deployed, according to a CNN tally.

Deadly aerial attacks
---------------------

Russia has ramped up its [airborne attacks](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/15/europe/russia-tactics-swarms-of-killer-drones-intl-cmd)
 against Ukraine in recent weeks, launching hundreds of drones and missiles nearly every night.

These assaults are not just bigger and more frequent; they are also more concentrated and executed in a way that makes them a lot more difficult to combat – as they are flown at higher altitudes, out of reach of machine guns.

Zelensky said on Sunday that more than 114 missiles, over 1,270 drones, and nearly 1,100 glide bombs were launched by Russia against Ukraine just this week.

The Ukrainian leader pleaded with Kyiv’s Western allies to provide more aerial defenses for his country, saying Russia will continue to attack Ukraine for as long as it can.

“This war must be brought to an end — pressure on the aggressor is needed, and so is protection. Protection from ballistic and other missiles, from drones, and from terror,” Zelensky said.

He added that Ukraine was ready to buy “American systems” to strengthen its air defenses – a clear call to US President Donald Trump and his administration to allow Ukraine to purchase the Patriot air defense systems.

The Patriots are widely considered to be among the best air defense systems. While there are other systems manufactured by some of Ukraine’s other allies, none can match the Patriots when it comes to protection against advanced hypersonic and ballistic missiles.

Ukraine is known to have roughly half a dozen of the [US-made Patriot air defense systems](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/05/world/trump-cut-ukrainian-aid-patriot-missiles-intl)
, although the exact numbers and their locations are closely guarded secrets.

The Patriots play a crucial role in Ukraine’s air defense, protecting millions of civilians from Russian missiles. Russian strikes were recorded in six locations with debris reported across eight locations, it added.

The Russian Ministry of Defense claimed the strikes targeted Ukraine’s “military-industrial complex facilities and oil refineries,” but the Ukrainians said civilian infrastructure objects were hit.

At least 11 people were injured, including two children, in a Russian attack in the city of Smila, in the central region of Cherkasy, local officials said in an update on Sunday.

Three nine-story buildings, private houses, and cars were significantly damaged in the shelling, as well as four educational institutions and a psychiatric hospital, Ihor Taburets, head of Cherkasy regional military administration, said.

Landmines question
------------------

Also on Sunday, Zelensky announced he signed a decree that would take Ukraine out of the Ottawa Treaty, the international agreement that bans the use of anti-personnel landmines.

A long-signalled move by Ukraine, the withdrawal still needs to be approved by Ukraine’s parliament. We cannot remain bound by conditions when the enemy has no restrictions,” Roman Kostenko, a member of the Ukrainian Parliament, said in a statement.

According to the United Nations, Ukraine is the most heavily mined country in the world. The US under the Biden Administration approved shipments of landmines to Ukraine last November.

Large swathes of Ukrainian land, especially along the frontlines in the east and in areas that were once occupied by Russia, are off limits to civilians because of the mines."

Russia's Defense Ministry characterized the barrage as a "massive strike with high-precision long-range air, sea and land-based weapons, including the Kinzhal aeroballistic hypersonic missile system, as well as unmanned aerial vehicles, against military-industrial complex facilities and oil refineries in Ukraine."

"The strike's objective was achieved, all designated targets were hit," the ministry said in a post to Telegram.

The ministry also said its forces shot down three Ukrainian drones overnight.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that a residential building in the town of Smila, close to the central city of Cherkasy, was among those hit by drones, with one child injured.

Zelenskyy also said he had ordered an investigation into Ustimenko's death, adding "Ukrainian aviation heroically defends the sky. "The work of Ukrainian fighters is extremely dangerous," it said.

Among the pilots was Lt. Saturday night's attack was one of -- if not the -- largest of Moscow's war to date.

In Poland -- which borders Ukraine to its west -- the Armed Forces Operational Command said in a post to X that the Russian strikes prompted Polish and allied aircraft to be scrambled.

The command said it "activated all available forces and resources at his disposal, the duty fighter pairs have been scrambled and the ground-based air defense and radar reconnaissance systems have reached the highest state of readiness. Ustimenko, it added, guided the plane away from residential areas on the ground but "did not have time to eject."

KYIV/LVIV, Ukraine, June 29 (Reuters) - A Ukrainian F-16 fighter pilot died in a crash while repelling a Russian air attack that involved hundreds of drones, cruise and ballistic missiles, authorities said on Sunday, as Moscow intensifies night-time air barrages in the [fourth year of war](https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraine-russia-war/)
.

President Volodymyr Zelenskiy praised the pilot, Maksym Ustymenko, and bestowed upon him posthumously the title of Hero of Ukraine, the country's highest decoration.

Sign up [here.](undefined?location=article-paragraph&redirectUrl=%2Fbusiness%2Faerospace-defense%2Fleast-six-wounded-large-scale-russian-air-attack-ukraine-ukrainian-authorities-2025-06-29%2F)

He also called for more support from Washington and Western allies to bolster Ukraine's air defences after the attack, which damaged homes and infrastructure across the country and injured at least 12 people, according to local authorities.

In Kyiv, families huddled in metro stations for shelter after air raid sirens rung out. Kyiv has not revealed the size of its F-16 fleet, but they have become a central and heavily used part of Ukraine's defences.

The pilot flew the damaged jet away from a settlement but had no time to eject before it crashed, the Ukrainian Air Force said.

"The pilot used all of his onboard weapons and shot down seven air targets. While shooting down the last one, his aircraft was damaged and began to lose altitude," the Air Force said on Telegram.

Ukrainian military expert Roman Svitan, speaking earlier this month, said the F-16 was not ideally suited to all tasks in the war, particularly repelling drones which swarm Ukrainian cities, as it is better used against higher-speed targets.

Zelenskiy, speaking in his nightly video address, said Ustymenko had been flying missions since the time of a campaign that began in 2014 against Russian-financed separatists who had seized parts of eastern Ukraine.

"He mastered four types of aircraft and had important results to his name in defending Ukraine," he said. Machine-gun fire and explosions were heard across the capital and in the western city of Lviv, where such attacks are less common.

The governor of the Lviv region, bordering Poland, said the raid targeted critical infrastructure.

Ukraine has now [lost](/world/europe/ukraine-pilot-killed-f-16-fighter-jet-lost-ukrainian-military-says-2025-06-29/)
 three F-16s since it began operating the U.S.-made jets last year. "It is painful to lose such people."

The Ukrainian military said in total Russia launched 477 drones and 60 missiles of various types to Ukraine overnight. Ukrainian forces destroyed 211 of the drones and 38 missiles, it said, while 225 more drones were either lost due to electronic warfare or were decoys that carried no explosives.

Writing earlier on X, Zelenskiy said: "Moscow will not stop as long as it has the capability to launch massive strikes." He said Russia had launched around 114 missiles, 1,270 drones, and 1,100 glide bombs just in the past week.

Russia's state-run RIA Novosti news agency said one person was killed by a Ukrainian drone in the Russian-controlled part of Ukraine's Luhansk region. Both Ukraine and Russia say they do not attack civilian targets.

POLITICAL WILL
--------------

Ukraine says recent attacks highlight the need for further support from Washington, which under President Donald Trump has not committed to new military aid for Ukraine.

Trump said he was considering a Ukrainian request [for more Patriot missile, opens new tab](europe)
 batteries after he met Zelenskiy at a NATO summit last Wednesday.

"This war must be brought to an end - pressure on the aggressor is needed, and so is protection," Zelenskiy said in his X post. "Ukraine needs to strengthen its air defence - the thing that best protects lives."

He said Ukraine was ready to buy the American air defence systems and it counts on "leadership, political will, and the support of the United States, Europe, and all our partners."

Russia has launched large-scale strikes on Ukrainian cities every few days in recent weeks, causing widespread damage, killing dozens of civilians and injuring hundreds more.

During the latest barrage, explosions were heard in Kyiv, Lviv, Poltava, Mykolaiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Cherkasy and the Ivano-Frankivsk regions, witnesses and regional governors said. The Ukrainian military said air strikes were recorded in six locations.

Eleven people, including two children, were injured in the central Cherkasy region, the regional governor said on Telegram."

Renovated in 2018, the facility in Toropets is estimated to have stored tonnes upon tonnes of military goods, including explosives, artillery shells and ballistic missiles.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A Ukrainian drone attack on a significant Russian weapons stockpile in the Tver region in the early hours of Wednesday might be the Ukrainian army's biggest hit against Moscow's arsenal since early 2022.

The blast from the strike was so strong that earthquake monitoring stations picked it up as if it were a minor earthquake, while NASA reported a series of heat sources spotted by its equipment from space.

The facility in Toropets is estimated to have stored around 30,000 tonnes of military munitions. The destruction of the ammunition that was stored there will most likely negatively affect the northern operational group of the Russian army.

But what is the Russian military storage facility in Toropets and how important is it?

Renovated in 2018, the facility in Toropets is estimated to have stored tonnes upon tonnes of military goods, including explosives, artillery shells and ballistic missiles.

The former Russian deputy defence minister Dmitry Bulgakov — who was arrested earlier this year on corruption charges — said after the renovations that the site met the "highest international standards" and could defend weapons from missiles and "even a small nuclear attack".

The storage site covered an area of over 5 square kilometres in size and a perimeter of more than 12 kilometres long. 

**Which missiles were stored at the facility?**
-----------------------------------------------

The town of Toropets is situated around 470 kilometers north of the Ukrainian border and the destruction of the ammunition that was stored there will most likely negatively affect the northern operational group of the Russian army, including the supply of troops in Kursk, Belgorod and Bryansk.

According to Ukrainian sources, the military site in Toropets reportedly housed fuel tanks, as well as missiles intended for Iskander missile systems, Tochka-U missile systems, guided aerial bombs and assorted artillery ammunition.

The head of Ukraine's Centre for Countering Disinformation, Andriy Kovalenko, said that in addition to its own ammunition, Russia had also started to store North Korean munitions in Toropets.

Maxar satellite service collected imagery clearly shows the extent of the damage from the Ukrainian drone attack causing a series of explosions, according to a photo shared by the Russia Team Lead at the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). 

The imagery shows large pillars of smoke covering much of the area, while a closer look at the ammunition storage area indicates that fires continue to burn in and near some bunkers, ISW's George Barros added.

**Have the storage bunkers been destroyed?**
--------------------------------------------

Most of the ammunition is presumably stored underground, so the question is whether Ukraine used any drones that could have penetrated inside the bunkers.

A full damage assessment remains impossible due to the thick smoke above the site. However, the possible destruction of the bunkers might have also been the result of Moscow not respecting its own regulations by placing the bunkers too close together, for example.

While repeatedly calling on the West to lift the restrictions over the use of long-range missiles deep into Russian territory, Ukraine has been using its home-produced UAVs to strike as deep as 1,800 kilometres into Russia, as was the case in the city of Orsk.

*   Massive blasts detected by earthquake monitors
*   NASA picks up multiple heat sources from space
*   Some anger expressed in Russia over the attack

LONDON, Sept 18 (Reuters) - A large-scale Ukrainian drone attack on Russia triggered an earthquake-sized blast at a major arsenal in the Tver region on Wednesday, forcing the evacuation of a nearby town, war bloggers and some media reported.

Unverified video and images on social media showed a huge ball of flame blasting into the night sky and multiple detonations thundering across a lake about 380 km (240 miles) west of Moscow.

NASA satellites picked up intense heat sources emanating from an area of about 14 square kilometres (5 square miles) at the site in the early hours and earthquake monitoring stations noted what sensors thought was a small [earthquake, opens new tab](https://www.volcanodiscovery.com/earthquakes/quake-info/9611698/mag2quake-Sep-18-2024-BALTIC-STATES-BELARUS-NW-RUSSIA-REGION.html#google_vignette)
 in the area.

"The enemy hit an ammunition depot in the area of Toropets," said Yuri Podolyaka, a Ukrainian-born, pro-Russian military blogger. "Everything that can burn is already burning there (and exploding)."

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, speaking in his nightly video address, hailed the outcome of the attack without referring specifically to the target.

"A very important result was achieved last night on Russian territory and such actions weaken the enemy," Zelenskiy said. "I thank everyone involved. Such precision is truly inspiring."

He thanked the SBU security service, the HUR intelligence service and the Special Operations Forces.

A source in Ukraine's SBU state security service had earlier told Reuters the drone attack had destroyed [a warehouse storing missiles](/world/europe/ukraine-destroyed-arsenal-russias-tver-region-kyiv-security-source-says-2024-09-18/)
, guided bombs and artillery ammunition.

Russian state media have in the past reported that a major arsenal for conventional weapons was located at the site of the blasts. State media, now subject to military censorship laws, was muted in its reporting on Wednesday.

Igor Rudenya, governor of the Tver region, said that Ukrainian drones had been shot down, that a fire had broken out and that some residents were being evacuated. He did not say what was burning.

One woman told Reuters that members of her family had been evacuated from Toropets.

"A fire started with explosions," said the woman, who identified herself only as Irina.

Rudenya later said the situation in Toropets was stable as of midday local time (0900 GMT) and that evacuated residents could return. The fire had been put out and there were no recorded fatalities, he said.

Russia and Ukraine each reported dozens of enemy drone attacks on their territory overnight, with Russian forces advancing in eastern [Ukraine](https://www.reuters.com/topic/event/ukraine-crisis/)
.

MAJOR EXPLOSION
---------------

The size of the main blast shown in the unverified social media video was consistent with 200-240 tons of high explosives detonating, said George William Herbert of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey in California.

A Toropets chatroom on the Russian social media site VK was flooded with messages of support from other parts of the country and offers of help to people fleeing the town.

Some people were asking whether buildings at specific addresses were still standing.

"People, does anyone know what's happened to Kudino village??? They told me nothing is left of our house," posted one woman.

Another woman replied: "It's horror there." Kudino is a village 4.5 km (2.8 miles) northeast of Toropets.

Some war bloggers asked how drones could trigger such large blasts at what was thought to be a highly fortified facility.

According to an RIA state news agency report from 2018, Russia was building an arsenal for the storage of missiles, ammunition and explosives in Toropets, a 1,000-year-old town, with a population of just over 11,000.

Dmitry Bulgakov, then a deputy defence minister, told RIA in 2018 that the facility could defend weapons from missiles and even a small nuclear attack. Bulgakov was arrested earlier this year on corruption charges, which he denies.

"It (the concrete facilities) ensures their reliable and safe storage, protects them from air and missile strikes and even from the damaging factors of a nuclear explosion," RIA quoted Bulgakov as saying at the time.

Some Russians on chat groups expressed anger.

"Why wasn't the ammunition underground?! What are you doing???? In Kudino, houses were blown away! Why is the forest burning and no one is there... What kind of negligence is this!!!!" one woman posted.

Russia reported that its air defence units had destroyed 54 drones launched against five Russian regions overnight, without mentioning Tver. Ukraine said it had [shot down 46 of 52 drones](/world/europe/russian-drones-attack-energy-facilities-ukraines-sumy-authorities-say-2024-09-18/)
 launched by Moscow overnight and that Russia had used three guided air missiles which did not reach their targets.

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian [drones struck a large military depot in a town deep inside Russia](https://apnews.com/article/poland-us-blinken-duda-ukraine-54232b14cae7785df02f9d48a77e7823)
 overnight, causing a huge fire and forcing some residents to evacuate, a Ukrainian official and Russian news reports said Wednesday. At least 13 people were injured, Russia’s Health Ministry added.

Meanwhile, a senior U.S. diplomat said [Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-kursk-incursion-gamble-battlefield-e862afd58c65d6d2d5b7b3747423ca4d)
 has a workable plan to end the war, now in its third year, although its details have not been publicly disclosed.

Ukraine claimed the strike destroyed military warehouses in Toropets, a town in Russia’s Tver region about 380 kilometers (240 miles) northwest of Moscow and about 500 kilometers (300 miles) from the border with Ukraine.

The attack was carried out by Ukraine’s Security Service, along with Ukraine’s Intelligence and Special Operations Forces, a Kyiv security official told The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the operation.

According to the official, the depot housed Iskander and Tochka-U missiles, as well as glide bombs and artillery shells. He said the facility caught fire in the strike and was burning across an area 6 kilometers (4 miles) wide.

Among the destroyed ammunition were North Korean KN-23 short-range ballistic missiles, another official, in Ukraine’s Intelligence Office, told AP. He also was not authorized to comment publicly and didn’t provide evidence to support his claim.

Russia and North Korea signed [a landmark pact](https://apnews.com/article/russia-putin-kim-north-korea-pact-556492779b6a32c4cf74b992741d91a8)
 in June that envisioned mutual military assistance between Moscow and Pyongyang.

More than 100 domestically produced exploding drones were deployed in the attack on the depot, the Ukrainian intelligence official added.

Russian state news agency RIA Novosti quoted regional authorities as saying air defense systems were working to repel a “massive drone attack” on Toropets, which has a population of about 11,000. The agency also reported a fire and the evacuations, and the Health Ministry said 13 people were hospitalized in the region after the attack.

Tver regional Gov. Igor Rudenya later said all evacuees could return home.

Successful Ukrainian strikes deep inside Russia have become more common as Kyiv developed its drone technology.

Zelenskyy also is seeking approval from Western nations for Ukraine to use the sophisticated weapons they are providing to hit targets inside Russia. Some Western leaders have balked at that, fearing they could be dragged into the conflict.

Part of Kyiv’s strategy is targeting of military equipment, ammunition and infrastructure deep inside Russia, as well as making civilians feel some of the consequences of the war that is being fought largely inside Ukraine.

The swift push by Ukrainian forces [into Russia’s Kursk border region](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-kursk-incursion-putin-1178b99b32b476816db3a48ffa06b11a)
 last month fits into that plan, which apparently seeks to compel Russian President Vladimir Putin to back down.

Putin, however, has shown no signs of that [and has been trying to grind down Ukraine’s resolve](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-putin-military-numbers-9c5554302486adfe7b3d69cb297f8a98)
 through attritional warfare and also sap the West’s support for Kyiv by drawing out the conflict. That has come at a price, however, as the U.K. Defense Ministry estimates the war has probably killed or wounded more than 600,000 Russian troops.

On Tuesday, Putin ordered the country’s military to [increase its number of troops](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-putin-military-numbers-9c5554302486adfe7b3d69cb297f8a98)
 by 180,000 to a total of 1.5 million by Dec. 1.

Zelenskyy announced his war plan in his nightly address on Monday, saying it’s 90% ready and will be presented to allies over the next week.

He said Ukraine’s [plan for victory](https://apnews.com/video/ukraine-government-kyiv-volodymyr-zelenskyy-ukraine-war-and-unrest-be06ac55f33246fd96f1898bac5a6884)
 includes not only battlefield goals but also diplomatic and economic wins. The plan has been kept under wraps but the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said at a news conference Tuesday that Washington officials have seen it.

“We think it lays out a strategy and a plan that can work,” she said, adding that the United States will bring it up with other world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly in New York next week. She did not comment on what the plan contained.

Video shows explosions after drone attack on Russian ammunition depot

00:58

CNN  — 

A Ukrainian drone attack launched overnight destroyed an ammunition depot in the western Russian region of Tver, a source from Ukraine’s Security Service (SBU) told CNN on Wednesday, causing a massive blast.

The Ukrainian drones targeted the Russian defense ministry-operated warehouse in the city of Toropets, which was storing Iskander tactical missile systems, Tochka-U tactical missile systems, guided aerial bombs and artillery ammunition, the source said.

Large fires broke out from the debris of drones repelled by local air defenses, the regional government said, prompting the governor, Igor Rudenya, to order a partial evacuation of the area during the early hours of Wednesday.

Earthquake monitors now believe explosions from the drone attack may have generated seismic activity. Ben Dando, a seismologist at the Norwegian seismology research foundation NORSAR, told CNN that its sensors “detected seismic signals, of magnitude 2.5 to 2.8, in northwest Russia which look to be associated with the drone attack launched by Ukraine.”

NORSAR, which has been using seismic monitors since 2022 to evaluate the impact of the war in Ukraine, is currently analyzing the preliminary data to capture the full extent of the blast, Dando added.

Satellite images taken by Maxar Technologies on Wednesday morning showed huge plumes of smoke rising up from several depot buildings, as well as extensive damage to the buildings and nearby forest.

Fires continue to burn, as seen in the Maxar Technologies images.

Russian state news agency TASS reported that a drone attack had been launched on the city of Toropets overnight causing a fire “due to the fall of debris,” without specifically mentioning any targeting of a weapons facility.

Videos circulating on social media, verified by CNN, showed loud detonations and multiple buildings in the depot complex on fire.

Affected residents, including 11 children, have already been evacuated to the settlements of Kunya and Velikiye Luki in the neighbouring Pskov region, TASS said. No civilians are thought to have been injured in the drone attack, the news agency reported, citing Rudenya.

“Now we are engaged in evacuating the population, residents, maintaining public order,” Rudenya said in a later video statement, stressing that multiple emergency service units were involved in the response.

Rudenya made the call to evacuate so emergency services at the scene could work fully to bring the blazes under control, the local government said in a post on its official Telegram channel.

The Ukrainian security source told CNN that attacks of this nature are being used “methodically” to reduce Russia’s missile potential, adding that plans for further attacks on “similar” Russian military facilities are “proceeding.”

Toropets is located around 300 miles from the Ukrainian border and about 250 miles west of Moscow.

Ukraine has been pushing its key allies, including the United States, to give the go-ahead to carry out missile strikes on targets deeper into Russian territory. Last week, Russian President Vladimir Putin [warned NATO members](https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/12/europe/putin-warns-nato-missiles-hnk-latam-intl/index.html)
 that lifting restrictions on Ukraine’s use of long-range missile systems would mean entering into war with Russia itself.
