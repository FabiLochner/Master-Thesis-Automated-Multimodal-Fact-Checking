## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
According to a Russia Matters article from February 26, 2025, over 700,000 Russian soldiers have been killed or injured in the Ukraine war, with an additional 48,000 missing (<image:k>). A Wikipedia article on the casualties of the Russo-Ukrainian War mentions that a British Army official estimated 1.5 to 1.8 million Russian casualties by July 2024. The article also notes that as of early February 2025, 1,382 Russian servicemen previously considered missing were confirmed to be in Ukrainian captivity.

A Mediazona article, updated on February 24, 2025, in collaboration with BBC News Russian service, provides information on Russian losses, with estimates as of December 2024. The article also mentions that by November 2024, the number of losses among prisoners had dropped to between 2â€“3%.

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the claim is inaccurate. While a British Army official estimated 1.5 to 1.8 million Russian casualties by July 2024, the Russia Matters article from February 26, 2025, reports over 700,000 Russian soldiers killed or injured, with an additional 48,000 missing. The Mediazona article, updated on February 24, 2025, provides loss estimates as of December 2024.

The Wikipedia article also mentions that as of early February 2025, 1,382 Russian servicemen previously considered missing were confirmed to be in Ukrainian captivity. This indicates that the total number of losses is likely less than 1.5 million.

Therefore, based on the provided evidence, the claim that Russia has lost 1.5 million troops as of February 2025 is not supported.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that the claim of 1.5 million Russian troop losses by February 2025 is not accurate. While there are estimates of casualties, including a British Army official's estimate of 1.5 to 1.8 million casualties by July 2024, more recent reports from February 2025 suggest lower figures for killed, injured, and missing soldiers. The evidence also includes information about prisoners of war, further suggesting that the total losses are less than the claimed 1.5 million. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is not supported by the evidence. While a British Army official estimated 1.5 to 1.8 million casualties by July 2024, a Russia Matters article from February 26, 2025, reports over 700,000 Russian soldiers killed or injured, with an additional 48,000 missing ([https://www.russiamatters.org/news/russia-ukraine-war-report-card/russia-ukraine-war-report-card-feb-26-2025](https://www.russiamatters.org/news/russia-ukraine-war-report-card/russia-ukraine-war-report-card-feb-26-2025)). Additionally, a Wikipedia article mentions that as of early February 2025, 1,382 Russian servicemen previously considered missing were confirmed to be in Ukrainian captivity ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties\_of\_the\_Russo-Ukrainian\_War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War)).
