## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Pete Hegseth, not the US Secretary of Defense, called Putin a "war criminal" on Fox News in March 2022. The evidence also shows that he has since been more cautious.


## Final Judgement
The claim is inaccurate because Pete Hegseth is not the US Secretary of Defense. The evidence confirms that Pete Hegseth, a Fox News personality, made the statement.

`false`
