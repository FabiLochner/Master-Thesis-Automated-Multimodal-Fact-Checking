Useful result: From [Source](https://meduza.io/en/news/2024/11/26/man-beaten-in-police-custody-for-burning-quran-gets-13-5-years-for-treason-against-russia-in-separate-case): 
Content: Meduza, November 26, 2024, reports that a man was sentenced to 13.5 years in prison for treason against Russia. Factoring in time already served, Nikita Zhuravel will spend the next 14 years incarcerated. Zhuravel was arrested in May 2023 for burning a Quran. In October 2024, he was charged with collaborating with Ukraineâ€™s security services.

The claim 'In November 2024 Russia sentenced a man to 14 years in prison for burning the Quran.' is false.
Justification: In November 2024, Nikita Zhuravel was sentenced to 14 years in prison. However, this sentence was for treason, as reported by [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-man-jailed-burning-koran-sentenced-14-years-separate-ukraine-treason-2024-11-25/) and [The Moscow Times](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2024/11/25/russian-man-jailed-for-quran-burning-sentenced-to-135-more-years-in-prison-for-treason-a87123/), not solely for burning the Quran, which was a separate offense.

So, the overall veracity is: false
