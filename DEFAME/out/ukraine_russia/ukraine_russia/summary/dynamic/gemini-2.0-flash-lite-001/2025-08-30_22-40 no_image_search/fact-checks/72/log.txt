Justification: Pete Hegseth, a Fox News personality, did call Putin a "war criminal" on Fox News in March 2022, as reported by Newsweek ([https://www.newsweek.com/pete-hegseth-vladimir-putin-war-criminal-1985251](https://www.newsweek.com/pete-hegseth-vladimir-putin-war-criminal-1985251)).

So, the overall veracity is: false
