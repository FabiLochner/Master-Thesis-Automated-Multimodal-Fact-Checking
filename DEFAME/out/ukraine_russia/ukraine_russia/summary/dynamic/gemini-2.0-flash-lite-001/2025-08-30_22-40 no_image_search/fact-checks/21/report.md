### Evidence from `web_search`
The provided web sources discuss Claudia Sheinbaum's statements on drug trafficking and her interactions with U.S. figures. One article from workers.org, published in February 2025, focuses on Sheinbaum's comments regarding the U.S.'s role in drug consumption and trafficking, emphasizing Mexican sovereignty.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Claudia Sheinbaum declined an invitation to visit Ukraine. However, there is no evidence to support the quote attributed to her in the claim. The search results do not mention the alleged statement.


## Final Judgement
The claim that Claudia Sheinbaum made the specific quote about Volodymyr Zelenskyy is not supported by the available evidence. While she did decline an invitation to visit Ukraine, there is no information to corroborate the statement attributed to her.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE
