## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results discuss claims about British special forces in Ukraine. One claim, originating from a Dutch journalist, alleges that a Russian strike killed 18 British special forces soldiers in Odesa, but this has been debunked by Ukrainian military officials. Another article reports that Russian special forces captured two British officers in Ukraine.

The first claim is discussed in articles from [UA Wire](https://www.uawire.org/false-allegations-of-british-sas-casualties-in-odesa-dutch-journalist-s-controversial-claims-debunked-by-ukrainian-military) and [Detector Media](https://disinfo.detector.media/en/post/russian-aircraft-allegedly-destroyed-a-british-special-forces-group-in-odesa). The second claim is discussed in an article from [EADaily](https://eadaily.com/en/news/2025/08/04/these-are-not-tourists-two-british-colonels-were-captured-by-russian-special-forces). ![image 1595](media/2025-08-07_18-53-1754592782-712556.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the claim about 18 British Special Forces being killed in the Odessa region in November 2024 is false. The search results reveal that Ukrainian military officials debunked this claim, which originated from a Dutch journalist. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the available evidence.


## Final Judgement
The claim is demonstrably false. The search results show that the claim about the death of 18 British Special Forces in Odessa, Ukraine, was debunked by Ukrainian military officials.
