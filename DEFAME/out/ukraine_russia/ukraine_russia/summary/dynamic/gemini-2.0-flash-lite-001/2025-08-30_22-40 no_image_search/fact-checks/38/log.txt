Useful result: From [Source](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/harris-standing-zelenskyy-indirectly-jabs-trump-vance-ukraine/story?id=114219628): 
Content: The ABC News article, published on September 26, 2024, reports on Vice President Kamala Harris meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to discuss the war with Russia. <image:1>, <image:2061>. The article mentions Zelenskyy's visit to Washington and his meetings with U.S. lawmakers.

The claim 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy engaged in election interference by campaigning in Pennsylvania for Kamala Harris ahead of the US presidential election in 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim that Volodymyr Zelenskyy campaigned for Kamala Harris is based on reports of his visit to a munitions plant in Pennsylvania and meetings with Harris, as reported by [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/volodymyr-zelensky-jd-vance-campaign-kamala-harris-2024-election-2038060), [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/zelenskyys-meeting-harris-spat-trump-reveal-growing-partisan-divide-uk-rcna172648), and [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/harris-standing-zelenskyy-indirectly-jabs-trump-vance-ukraine/story?id=114219628). However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Zelenskyy was campaigning for Harris, but rather that his actions were perceived by some as a form of support.

So, the overall veracity is: false
