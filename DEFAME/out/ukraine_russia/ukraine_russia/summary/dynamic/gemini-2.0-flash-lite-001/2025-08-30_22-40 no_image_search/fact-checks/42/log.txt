Content: Al Jazeera published an article on February 21, 2025, fact-checking claims about Ukraine and its president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The article states that in a February 2 interview with the Associated Press, Zelenskyy said Ukraine’s military has received only a portion of the billions in US aid earmarked for Ukraine’s defense against Russia. Zelenskyy cited a total of $177bn or $200bn spent by the US and said Ukraine had not received about $100bn of that total. <image:i>. The article also mentions that the US has spent $183bn to help Ukraine. The article is authored by Jeff Cercone from PolitiFact.

Content: Pravda.com.ua published an article on February 2, 2025, stating that Zelenskyy said Ukraine received about $76 billion of the approximately $177 billion in aid approved by the U.S. <image:3378>. The article cites an interview with the Associated Press. Zelenskyy stated that the aid came in the form of weapons, which amounted to about $70 billion. The article also mentions that in November 2024, Zelenskyy said Ukraine had not received even half of the weapons officially allocated by the United States.

The claim 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's statement in an AP news interview from February 1, 2025 that his country's military has received only a portion of the more than 175 billion in U.S. aid confirms that the US aid is a money laundering operation.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While Zelenskyy did state in an AP interview on February 1, 2025, that Ukraine had received only a portion of the U.S. aid, there is no evidence from the provided sources ([https://iz.ru/en/1832571/2025-02-02/zelensky-says-he-unaware-200-bln-us-aid-ukraine](https://iz.ru/en/1832571/2025-02-02/zelensky-says-he-unaware-200-bln-us-aid-ukraine), [https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/21/us-president-trumps-claims-about-zelenskyy-and-ukraine-fact-checked](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/21/us-president-trumps-claims-about-zelenskyy-and-ukraine-fact-checked), [https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2025/02/2/7496431/](https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2025/02/2/7496431/)) to support the assertion that he claimed the aid was a money laundering operation.

So, the overall veracity is: false
