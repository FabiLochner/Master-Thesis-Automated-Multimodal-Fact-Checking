## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Soviet Union invaded Manchukuo in 1945, as part of World War II, overwhelming the Japanese forces. The invasion resulted in significant casualties and the collapse of Japanese control in the region. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_invasion_of_Manchuria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_invasion_of_Manchuria))

According to the South China Morning Post, leaked Russian military documents reveal plans to target 160 sites in Japan and South Korea, including civilian infrastructure (![image 3874](media/2025-08-22_23-55-1755906949-169265.jpg)). Al Jazeera reports that Russian and Chinese naval vessels plan to conduct a joint patrol in the Asia Pacific region (<image:k>).

## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim that China and Japan plan to invade the Russian Federation. The provided sources mention a Soviet invasion of Manchuria in 1945 ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_invasion_of_Manchuria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_invasion_of_Manchuria)), leaked Russian military documents targeting Japan and South Korea ([https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3293037/russias-uncovered-secret-war-plans-target-160-sites-japan-and-south-korea](https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3293037/russias-uncovered-secret-war-plans-target-160-sites-japan-and-south-korea)), and joint naval patrols between Russia and China ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/6/russia-china-naval-forces-to-carry-out-joint-asia-pacific-patrol-report](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/6/russia-china-naval-forces-to-carry-out-joint-asia-pacific-patrol-report)). None of these sources mention any invasion plans by China or Japan against Russia.


## Final Judgement
The evidence provided does not support the claim that China and Japan plan to invade the Russian Federation. The search results mention historical events and current military activities, but they do not contain any information about the alleged invasion plans.

`false`
