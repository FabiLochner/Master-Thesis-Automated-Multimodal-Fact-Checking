## Elaboration
The claim is false. The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry stated that reports of Truth Social being blocked in Ukraine are false, as the platform's regional availability is limited and has never been available to Ukrainian users.


## Final Judgement
The search results indicate that the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry denied reports of Truth Social being blocked in Ukraine, stating that the platform was never available to Ukrainian users. This contradicts the claim that Zelenskyy blocked access to the platform.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE
