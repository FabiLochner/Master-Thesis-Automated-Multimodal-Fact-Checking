Useful result: From [Source](https://en.zona.media/article/2025/08/29/casualties_eng-trl): 
Content: The Mediazona, in collaboration with the BBC’s Russian service, estimates that by August 2025, around 220,000 Russian men between 18 and 55 had been killed in the war. The article also mentions that by August 29, the death of over 5,500 officers of the Russian army and other security agencies had been confirmed. The date of death is known in 98,340 cases.

The claim 'As of February 2025, Russia has lost 1.5 million troops in the Ukraine war.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not supported by the evidence. While various sources provide estimates of Russian casualties in the Ukraine war, none of them confirm the specific figure of 1.5 million losses as of February 2025. A report from August 2025, estimates around 220,000 deaths ([https://en.zona.media/article/2025/08/29/casualties_eng-trl](https://en.zona.media/article/2025/08/29/casualties_eng-trl)).

So, the overall veracity is: false
