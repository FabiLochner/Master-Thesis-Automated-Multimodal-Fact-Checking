Useful result: From [Source](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/news-wrap-biden-tours-helene-storm-damage-in-carolinas): 
Content: PBS News published on October 2, 2024, reports that President Biden toured the storm damage caused by Hurricane Helene in the Carolinas. Biden ordered 1,000 active-duty troops to the region to help with aid efforts and committed to covering 100 percent of all costs related to debris removal in the state for six months. The article also mentions the Ukrainian military's retreat from Vuhledar.

The claim 'In remarks to reporters on September 29, 2024 US President Joe Biden announced that no more aid would be provided for the areas affected by Hurrican Helene, but 2.4 billion US-$ more for Ukraine.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. On September 29, 2024, President Biden announced an $8 billion military aid package for Ukraine, not $2.4 billion, and stated he would request supplemental aid for Hurricane Helene victims, contradicting the claim that no more aid would be provided, as reported by [Yahoo News](https://www.yahoo.com/news/no-biden-didnt-hes-done-153402427.html).

So, the overall veracity is: false
