```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image shows a Russian Air Force MiG-29S Fulcrum involved in a mid-air collision during a British air show in 1993. The photo was taken on July 24, 1993, in Fairford, United Kingdom. The pilot can be seen ejecting. ![image 5](media/6.jpg)

The image is available on websites such as [Airteamimages](https://www.airteamimages.com/mikoyan-gurevich-mig-29_925_russia---russian-air-force_48672), [Peakpx](https://www.peakpx.com/en/hd-wallpaper-desktop-oyvnm), and [Factcheckkorea.afp.com](https://factcheckkorea.afp.com/doc.afp.com.324U6AA).


## Elaboration
The image depicts a Russian MiG-29S Fulcrum, not a US F-16 fighter jet. The event occurred in 1993, not August 2024. The incident was a mid-air collision during an air show, not a shooting down after disobeying orders.


## Final Judgement
The image shows a Russian MiG-29S Fulcrum involved in a mid-air collision during a British air show in 1993, not a US F-16 fighter jet shot down in 2024. The claim misrepresents the aircraft, the date, and the circumstances of the event.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image depicts a Russian MiG-29S Fulcrum involved in a mid-air collision during a British air show in 1993, not a US F-16 fighter jet shot down in 2024, as evidenced by reverse image searches on sites like [Airteamimages](https://www.airteamimages.com/mikoyan-gurevich-mig-29_925_russia---russian-air-force_48672). The claim is therefore false.
