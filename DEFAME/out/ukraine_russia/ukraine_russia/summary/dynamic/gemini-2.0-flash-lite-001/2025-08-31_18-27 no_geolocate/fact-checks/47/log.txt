Content: The search result from Myth Detector, published on April 8, 2025, fact-checks a fabricated Charlie Hebdo cover depicting Zelenskyy in a coffin. The article states that the magazine did not publish the cover, and the date (March 20, 2025) and issue number (1705) are incorrect. <image:9642>.

Content: The Africanews website published an article on May 6, 2025, about a fake Charlie Hebdo cover that mocks Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the death of Pope Francis. <image:9648> The article states that the image is not authentic and provides evidence, including the correct edition number and a link to the real Charlie Hebdo website. The article also mentions that Charlie Hebdo has previously warned about pro-Russian actors creating fake covers.
