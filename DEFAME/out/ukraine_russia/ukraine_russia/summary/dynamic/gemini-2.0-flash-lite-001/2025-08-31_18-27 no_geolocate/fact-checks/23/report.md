## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Council on Foreign Relations ([https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-us-aid-going-ukraine](https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-us-aid-going-ukraine)) mentions that Ukraine is the top recipient of U.S. aid since the Russian invasion in February 2022. It also mentions a $20 billion loan provided to the Ukrainian government in late 2024. NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2025/08/05/g-s1-81084/europe-us-weapons-ukraine-russia-war](https://www.npr.org/2025/08/05/g-s1-81084/europe-us-weapons-ukraine-russia-war)) states that the U.S. has provided around $75 billion in military assistance to Ukraine since the full-scale invasion in 2022, and that President Trump announced a new arrangement to send weapons to Ukraine last month. ![image 496](media/2025-08-06_17-42-1754502173-562939.jpg), ![image 497](media/2025-08-06_17-42-1754502174-952586.jpg)

The CSIS ([https://www.csis.org/analysis/trump-administration-boosts-immediate-military-aid-deliveries-ukraine](https://www.csis.org/analysis/trump-administration-boosts-immediate-military-aid-deliveries-ukraine)) published an article on February 11, 2025, discussing the Trump administration's boost to military aid deliveries to Ukraine. ![image 503](media/2025-08-06_17-43-1754502186-411462.jpg), ![image 502](media/2025-08-06_17-43-1754502185-652269.jpg), ![image 501](media/2025-08-06_17-43-1754502184-885543.jpg) Another article published on July 25, 2025, mentions the administration's announcement of military aid for Ukraine. The Trump administration announced weapons sales to Ukraine totaling $652 million under the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program, adding to the $310 million in FMS approved in May. The policy appears to keep in place the military aid committed under the Biden administration, which is set to deliver around $30 billion over the next three-and-a-half years.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the claim is inaccurate. The NPR article ([https://www.npr.org/2025/08/05/g-s1-81084/europe-us-weapons-ukraine-russia-war](https://www.npr.org/2025/08/05/g-s1-81084/europe-us-weapons-ukraine-russia-war)) states that the U.S. has provided around $75 billion in military assistance to Ukraine since the full-scale invasion in 2022. Furthermore, the evidence indicates that the Trump administration was actively involved in providing military aid to Ukraine in February 2025. The evidence does not support the $350 billion figure.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that the claim is false. While the U.S. has provided substantial military aid to Ukraine, the amount is significantly less than $350 billion. The provided sources mention figures around $75 billion.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. Evidence from sources like NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2025/08/05/g-s1-81084/europe-us-weapons-ukraine-russia-war](https://www.npr.org/2025/08/05/g-s1-81084/europe-us-weapons-ukraine-russia-war)) indicates that the U.S. has provided approximately $75 billion in military assistance to Ukraine since the full-scale invasion in 2022, not $350 billion.
