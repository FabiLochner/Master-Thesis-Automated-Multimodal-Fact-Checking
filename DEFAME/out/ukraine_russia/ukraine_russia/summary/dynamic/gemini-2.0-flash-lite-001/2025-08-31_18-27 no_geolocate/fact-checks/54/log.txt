Content: PBS Frontline World discusses illicit weapons, high-level corruption, and organized crime centered in Ukraine. Ukraine inherited huge stockpiles of arms after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The Ukrainian government must do more to clean up its arms exports industry. Ukraine is notorious for its booming legal arms industry. Between 1992 and 1998, Ukraine lost $32 billion in military assets, in part through theft, discount arms sales and lack of oversight. Theft and corruption in the military facilitated the flow of illegal weapons from Ukraine.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-us-aid-going-ukraine): 
Content: The Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) states that Ukraine is the top recipient of U.S. aid since the Russian invasion in February 2022. The aid includes weapons systems, training, and intelligence. The article mentions that in 2025, President Donald Trump froze military aid to Ukraine, but lifted the freeze shortly after. The article does not mention Ukraine selling armaments.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.csis.org/analysis/trump-sends-weapons-ukraine-numbers): 
Content: The CSIS article discusses the state of military aid to Ukraine, including announcements and deliveries of weapons, and the history of aid flow under the Trump administration. It provides graphs illustrating announcements and deliveries of newly made weapons <image:13576> and the status of U.S. military aid to Ukraine <image:13577>.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.dsca.mil/Press-Media/Major-Arms-Sales/Article-Display/Article/4289280/ukraine-air-delivered-munitions): 
Content: The U.S. State Department approved a Foreign Military Sale to Ukraine for Air Delivered Munitions and related equipment, estimated at $825 million, on August 28, 2025. Ukraine requested to buy up to 3,350 Extended Range Attack Munition (ERAM) missiles and 3,350 Embedded Global Positioning System (GPS)/Inertial Navigation Systems (INS). Funding will come from Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway, and Foreign Military Financing from the United States. The sale aims to improve Ukraine's self-defense capabilities.

The claim 'Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States' is false.
Justification: The investigation found no evidence to support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. While Ukraine is a major recipient of U.S. military aid, and there are documented concerns about corruption and arms trafficking, the provided sources, including those from Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/21/tracking-us-and-nato-support-for-ukraine-a-full-breakdown](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/21/tracking-us-and-nato-support-for-ukraine-a-full-breakdown)) and the Council on Foreign Relations ([https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-us-aid-going-ukraine](https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-us-aid-going-ukraine)), do not mention or confirm any such sales.

So, the overall veracity is: false
