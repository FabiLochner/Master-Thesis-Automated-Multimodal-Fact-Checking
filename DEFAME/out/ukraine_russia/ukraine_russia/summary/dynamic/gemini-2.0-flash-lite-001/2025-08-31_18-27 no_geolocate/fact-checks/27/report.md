## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Detector Media reports that a fake news story claims Volodymyr Zelenskyy bought a $35 million residence in Florida, which was denied by Check Your Fact. The article suggests the fake news is part of Russian propaganda, as does a VOA News article that discusses Russian propaganda portraying Zelenskyy as a supervillain, including false stories about him buying yachts. Investigative journalists and fact-checkers have been looking into the Kremlin's claims and proving them false. (![image 13411](media/2025-08-31_18-42-1756665743-076902.jpg))

Treasure Coast Newspapers debunks claims that Volodymyr Zelenskyy lives in Florida or owns property there, referencing a social media rumor debunked by news agencies. (<image:k>)


### Evidence from `web_search`
According to Myth Detector, Zelenskyy's income decreased after the war began, and his family's financial situation was affected by the temporary suspension of rental income from real estate. Forbes estimates Zelenskyy's net worth to be less than $30 million. The article debunks claims about Zelenskyy purchasing expensive properties.

An article from AOL states that Zelenskyy's net worth is roughly $1.5 million, not $1.5 billion. His annual salary as Ukrainian president is approximately $11,200. Zelenskyy's 2018 financial disclosure listed total assets worth 37 million hryvnias.

## Elaboration
The evidence contradicts the claim. Multiple sources debunk the claim that Zelenskyy owns a $35 million home in Florida, with some suggesting it is part of Russian propaganda. Furthermore, the evidence indicates that Zelenskyy's net worth is significantly less than $1.2 billion, with estimates ranging from $1.5 million to less than $30 million. His annual salary is also far less than $11 million per month.

The evidence does not provide information about the number of homes Zelenskyy owns or whether he owns private planes.


## Final Judgement
The claim is demonstrably false. Multiple sources debunk the claim that Zelenskyy owns a $35 million home in Florida and has $1.2 billion in an overseas bank account. The evidence suggests that the claim is part of Russian propaganda.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is demonstrably false. Multiple sources, including [Detector Media](https://www.detector.media/en/infospace/article/160777/fake-news-about-zelenskyys-property-in-florida-is-part-of-russian-propaganda/), debunk the assertion that Zelenskyy owns a $35 million home in Florida. Furthermore, reports from [AOL](https://www.aol.com/much-volodymyr-zelenskyy-worth-160047933.html) and [Myth Detector](https://mythdetector.com/en/change-during-the-russia-ukraine-war/) indicate that his net worth and income are significantly lower than what the claim suggests.
