The claim '<image:20> This image shows a US drone which was shot down in March 2025 by the Houthis using Russian missiles.' is false.
Justification: The image in the claim does not match any of the drone crash sites found in the search results. While there is evidence of US drones being shot down by the Houthis, the specific image and its context cannot be verified. Therefore, the claim is false.

So, the overall veracity is: false
