## Elaboration
The claim that the image shows a military parade on August 14, 2024, is inaccurate. The evidence indicates that the parade took place on August 15, 2024, as part of Poland's Armed Forces Day. The parade commemorates the victory over Soviet Russia.

The evidence does not support the claim that the parade was preparing for war with Russia.


## Final Judgement
The image is from a military parade in Poland on August 15, 2024, not August 14, 2024. The parade is part of the Armed Forces Day celebrations. The claim that the parade is preparing for war with Russia is not supported by the evidence. `false`

The parade commemorates Poland's victory over Soviet Russia, and there is no evidence to support the claim that it was preparing for war.
