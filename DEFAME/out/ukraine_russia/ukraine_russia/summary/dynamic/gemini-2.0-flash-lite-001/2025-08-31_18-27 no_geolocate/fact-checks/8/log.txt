Content: The China Daily published an article on March 22, 2022, about the Red Cross Society of China providing humanitarian aid to Ukraine. The article includes an image of boxes with the Red Cross Society of China logo being loaded onto a forklift <image:13332>.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3169853/china-sends-first-shipment-humanitarian-aid-ukraine): 
Content: The South China Morning Post published an article on March 10, 2022, stating that China sent its first shipment of humanitarian aid to Ukraine. The aid was sent by the Red Cross Society of China. <image:13333>

The claim '<image:6> This image shows the Chinese Communist Party's Red Cross troops in Russia who have changed into winter clothes and set off for the Russian-Ukrainian front to aid Russia in rescuing its occupied territories.' is false.
Justification: The claim is **false**. While the image depicts an airliner, the assertion that it shows Chinese Red Cross troops aiding Russia in Ukraine is not supported. Evidence indicates that China has provided humanitarian aid to Ukraine while also supporting Russia's military efforts, making the claim misleading.

So, the overall veracity is: false
