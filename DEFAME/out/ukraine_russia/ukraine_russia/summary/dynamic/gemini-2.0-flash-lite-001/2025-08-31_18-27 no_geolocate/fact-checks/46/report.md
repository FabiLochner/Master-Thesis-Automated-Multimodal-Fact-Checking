## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
CBS News reports on a meeting between President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House in April 2025, discussing the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and ceasefire talks. The article does not mention any plans to resettle Palestinians in Gaza to Ukraine or Syria. ([https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-netanyahu-meeting-dc-israel-hamas-war-gaza-ceasefire/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-netanyahu-meeting-dc-israel-hamas-war-gaza-ceasefire/)) ![image 5555](media/2025-08-29_19-17-1756495042-263232.jpg), ![image 5553](media/2025-08-29_19-17-1756495040-802178.jpg)

The Washington Post published an article on July 7, 2025, discussing a meeting between President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House, mentioning the U.S. pushing for a ceasefire deal in Gaza.

## Elaboration
The CBS News article about the meeting between Trump and Netanyahu in April 2025 does not mention any plans to resettle Palestinians in Gaza to Ukraine or Syria. The Washington Post article from July 2025 also does not mention such plans. However, the BBC article mentions a plan by Donald Trump for a US takeover of the Gaza Strip and John Bolton suggesting the possibility of resettlement for Palestinians in Gaza.

Based on the evidence, the claim is not supported. The CBS News and Washington Post articles do not mention the resettlement plans. The BBC article mentions the possibility of resettlement, but it does not specify that Netanyahu announced it.

Therefore, the claim is unverified.


## Final Judgement
The search results reveal that while there were discussions about the Israel-Hamas war and potential ceasefire deals during Netanyahu's visit to the White House in April 2025, there is no evidence to support the claim that Netanyahu announced plans to resettle Palestinians in Gaza to Ukraine and Syria. The BBC article mentions the possibility of resettlement, but it does not specify that Netanyahu announced it.

The claim is not supported by the available evidence. Therefore, the most appropriate decision option is `false`.


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is not supported by the evidence. While there were discussions about the Israel-Hamas war during Netanyahu's visit to the White House in April 2025, as reported by [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-netanyahu-meeting-dc-israel-hamas-war-gaza-ceasefire/) and [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/07/trump-presidency-news/), there is no mention of Netanyahu announcing plans to resettle Palestinians in Gaza to Ukraine and Syria. The [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/live/cvg4zwwez9et) mentions the possibility of resettlement, but not that Netanyahu announced it.
