### Evidence from `image_search`
The Hill ([Source](https://thehill.com/homenews/ap/ap-u-s-news/ap-biden-takes-inaugural-flight-in-long-delayed-new-marine-one-helicopter/)) provides an image of a helicopter ![image 13434](media/2025-08-31_18-49-1756666177-230301.jpg). The search result from wvia.org ([Source](https://www.wvia.org/news/local/2024-04-16/041624biden-landing)) contains an image of Joe Biden exiting a plane ![image 13435](media/2025-08-31_18-49-1756666178-531848.jpg). The release date is April 16, 2024.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Joe Biden welcomed the freed Americans upon their arrival at Joint Base Andrews on August 1, 2024. He greeted them on the tarmac and embraced them. The evidence does not explicitly state that Biden boarded an empty plane after the freed Americans exited. However, the Times of India article mentions that Biden boarded a plane to thank the flight crew. Therefore, the claim is partially supported, but the exact sequence of events is not entirely clear.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2g2dx7d9wo): 
Content: The BBC News article, published on August 2, 2024, reports that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris greeted the freed Americans at Joint Base Andrews. The article mentions that the freed Americans emerged from the jet and were greeted by cheers. They lingered on the tarmac for photographs and conversations before leaving the air base. ![image 13442](media/2025-08-31_18-49-1756666199-670697.jpg), ![image 13446](media/2025-08-31_18-50-1756666203-048460.jpg), ![image 13444](media/2025-08-31_18-50-1756666201-538157.jpg).


## Elaboration
The BBC News article ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2g2dx7d9wo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2g2dx7d9wo)) confirms that the freed Americans emerged from the jet and were greeted by Biden and Harris. The article also mentions that the freed Americans lingered on the tarmac for photographs and conversations before leaving the air base. This suggests that Biden did not board the plane after the freed Americans exited. The Times of India article suggests that Biden boarded a plane to thank the flight crew, but it is unclear if it was the same plane.

Therefore, the claim is partially inaccurate.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that Joe Biden greeted the freed Americans upon their arrival. However, the claim that he boarded an empty plane after they exited is not directly supported by the evidence. While one source mentions Biden boarding a plane to thank the flight crew, it's unclear if it was the same plane.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is partially inaccurate. While Joe Biden did greet the freed Americans upon their arrival on August 1, 2024, at Joint Base Andrews, the evidence does not directly support the assertion that he boarded an empty plane after they exited. The BBC News article ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2g2dx7d9wo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2g2dx7d9wo)) indicates that the freed Americans remained on the tarmac after exiting the plane. Although a Times of India article mentions Biden boarding a plane to thank the flight crew, it is unclear if it was the same aircraft.
