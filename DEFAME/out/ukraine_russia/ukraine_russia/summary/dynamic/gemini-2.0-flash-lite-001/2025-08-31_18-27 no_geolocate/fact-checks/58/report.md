## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Pro-Kremlin social media accounts spread a baseless narrative that mansions belonging to Ukrainian military officials burned down in the Los Angeles wildfires, according to articles from NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2025/01/16/nx-s1-5259842/los-angeles-california-fires-russia-ukraine](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/16/nx-s1-5259842/los-angeles-california-fires-russia-ukraine)) and Houston Public Media ([https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/npr/2025/01/16/nx-s1-5259842/russia-tried-to-use-the-l-a-wildfires-to-spread-anti-ukraine-propaganda/](https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/npr/2025/01/16/nx-s1-5259842/russia-tried-to-use-the-l-a-wildfires-to-spread-anti-ukraine-propaganda/)). The claim was debunked by fact-checkers from Greece and the United States. The Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council's Center for Countering Disinformation described the claim as "Russian propaganda." NPR has not obtained evidence that any Ukrainian generals owned homes in Los Angeles that were destroyed by the fires.

Forbes ([https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2025/01/13/satire-or-disinformation-ukrainian-generals-lost-homes-in-la-fires/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2025/01/13/satire-or-disinformation-ukrainian-generals-lost-homes-in-la-fires/)) states that there is zero evidence to support this claim, which originated on a Russian Telegram channel and was initially satire. The claim is part of a disinformation campaign based on the unsubstantiated belief that Ukrainian officials are getting rich while the war continues. ![image 2335](media/2025-08-07_20-30-1754598606-937437.jpg) ![image 2342](media/2025-08-07_20-30-1754598640-955496.jpg)


## Elaboration
The claim is false. The evidence indicates that the claim originated from a Russian Telegram channel and was part of a disinformation campaign. Fact-checkers from Greece and the United States debunked the claim. NPR has not found any evidence to support the claim that Ukrainian generals owned homes in Los Angeles that were destroyed by the fires ([https://www.npr.org/2025/01/16/nx-s1-5259842/los-angeles-california-fires-russia-ukraine](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/16/nx-s1-5259842/los-angeles-california-fires-russia-ukraine)). Forbes also states that there is zero evidence to support the claim ([https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2025/01/13/satire-or-disinformation-ukrainian-generals-lost-homes-in-la-fires/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2025/01/13/satire-or-disinformation-ukrainian-generals-lost-homes-in-la-fires/)).


## Final Judgement
The claim that eight mansions belonging to Ukrainian military officials burned down in the January 2025 wildfires in Los Angeles is false. Multiple sources, including NPR and Forbes, have debunked the claim, stating that it originated from a Russian Telegram channel and is part of a disinformation campaign. There is no evidence to support the claim.
