Multiple tweets, posted between November 12-15, 2022, claim that Ukraine sent billions of dollars sourced from foreign aid to FTX, which was then sent back to the Democratic party.

The claim has been spread by a number of prominent right-leaning commentators and politicians, including [Madison Cawthorn](https://twitter.com/CawthornforNC)
, [James Woods](https://twitter.com/RealJamesWoods/status/1592041414829166592)
, [Calvin Robinson](https://twitter.com/calvinrobinson/status/1592031504875544577)
, [Seth Dillon](https://twitter.com/SethDillon/status/1591992688940924931)
 and [Jack Posobiec](https://twitter.com/JackPosobiec/status/1591855516053303298)
, among others.

Various iterations of the narrative took root on conspiracy theory subreddits, 4Chan, and other fringe online spaces.

The collapse of FTX has had a staggering impact on the world of cryptocurrencies, resulting in a dominoes-like collapse of popular cryptos, such as [Bitcoin](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/bitcoin)
, the value of [which fell to a two-year-low](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/09/bitcoin-falls-below-17k-amid-latest-ftx-meltdown/)
, and shaking the industry as a whole.

To understand if and how its demise is connected to U.S. dollar, though that may be no longer [tenable](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/10/tethers-usdt-stablecoin-slips-from-1-peg/)
).

Everstake, a crypto firm involved in setting up the donations, [has responded on Twitter](https://twitter.com/everstake_pool/status/1592621937054085120)
 to claims that these funds were illegally transferred to the Democrats, stating Aid for Ukraine had used FTX "only a few times in March 2022 exclusively to convert crypto donations into fiat" which it said The National Bank of Ukraine [had confirmed receipt of.](https://twitter.com/NBUkraine/status/1502207218514604034)

It added that of the $60 million received through Aid For Ukraine, $54 million had been spent on "Ukraine's humanitarian and military needs." Ukraine's Vice Prime Minister Fedorov Mykhailo made the same claim on Twitter, and included what he said was a [breakdown of this spending.](https://twitter.com/FedorovMykhailo/status/1559923193581899777)

Everstake added that the funds received were not stored on FTX and could be "converted into fiat elsewhere if necessary."

Its CEO Sergey Vasylchuk [took to Twitter](https://twitter.com/everstake_pool/status/1592622417226366977)
 as well, alleging that the claim was part of a Russian disinformation effort.

"Every time Russia is defeated on the battlefield, it starts looking for another way to cover up its military failures in the media by spreading fake news based on made-up assumptions," Vasylchuk said.

"This time, they decided to use the FTX collapse to spin yet another tale about money laundering. aid misappropriated?
-----------------------------

The claim that funds were effectively "laundered" from Ukraine via FTX back into the U.S., less so to the Democratic party coffers or Biden himself, is unevidenced.

_Newsweek_ has investigated the coverage of this claim across social media and larger media outlets and could find no transaction ID, statements, or any other tangible evidence to support the idea that U.S. government funding—under the nose of a multi-million dollar oversight process coordinated between the Office of Inspector General, the DOD and USAID—it would require a major lapse in oversight from those auditing Ukraine and a breakdown of protections in place to ensure funds could not be re-appropriated.

Did FTX send Ukrainian crypto donations to the U.S.?
----------------------------------------------------

FTX has also played a role in providing Ukraine with the capability to receive cryptocurrency donations since Russia's invasion.

In [March 2022](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/03/14/ukraine-partners-with-ftx-everstake-to-launch-new-crypto-donation-website/)
, the Ukrainian government launched a crypto donations website, Aid for Ukraine, with the backing of FTX, to route donated crypto to the National Bank of Ukraine. According [to its website](https://aid-for-ukraine.io/)
, Aid for Ukraine has received more than $60 million in donations including [611 Bitcoin](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/357a3So9CbsNfBBgFYACGvxxS6tMaDoa1P)

, and 15,048,821 USDT (which is at least on paper supposed to be pegged to the U.S. foreign aid receives to ensure that it is spent appropriately on measures relating to Ukrainian assistance.

For example, under the Additional Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Act 2022, the bill behind the $40 billion in emergency funding to Ukraine, $5 million was spent on oversight of the funds alone, including by the Department of State Inspector General and the USAID Inspector General.

The Office of Inspector General Oversight in the Department of Defence (DOD OIG) and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID OIG) both provide audits of the use of funding in Ukraine and investigate complaints and allegations of misuse or attempted misuse of [USAID funding](https://oig.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/2022-11/Office%20of%20Investigations%20Ukraine%20Briefing%20Sheet%20-%20Oct%2022.pdf)

These include (but are not limited to) verification of cash assistance, using regulated money transfer agents, and using security-locked beneficiary lists before they are disseminated.

CLAIM: U.S. The company filed for bankruptcy protection amid news it was short billions of dollars and may have been hacked.

The move has fueled baseless conspiracy theories on social media around the embattled former CEO’s donations, FTX, and Democrats who ran in this year’s midterm elections.

“So Biden gave loads of money to Ukraine, who gave loads of money to FTX, who gave loads of money to Democrats,” reads one tweet with over 100,000 likes.

“For an entire year Democrat law makers have stood on the House floor and demanded taxpayer $$ for Ukraine. The ministry said it “provided informational support” to the foundation, which was run by the cryptocurrency exchange Kuna and the blockchain company Everstake.

In early March, Aid For Ukraine began working with FTX to convert cryptocurrency donations into Ukraine’s government-issued currency, a partnership that ended in April 2022, according to the ministry.

Sergey Vasylchuk, the CEO of Everstake, told the AP that cryptocurrencies were an efficient way to raise funds for Ukraine to defend itself amid Russia’s invasion. The donations would then get sent to the [National Bank of Ukraine](https://twitter.com/NBUkraine/status/1502207218514604034)
 and no crypto was stored on FTX.

“It was eight months ago and the goal was that Aid for Ukraine was to supply the needs as soon as possible,” Vasylchuk said when asked about the relationship between Aid for Ukraine and FTX. FTX’s co-CEO [Ryan Salame](https://www.fec.gov/data/receipts/individual-contributions/?contributor_name=Ryan+Salame&two_year_transaction_period=2022&min_date=01%2F01%2F2021&max_date=12%2F31%2F2022)
 also donated to groups that supported Republican candidates in 2022, including the Senate Leadership Fund, the Congressional Leadership Fund and American Dream Federal Action, which he [founded](https://americandreamaction.com/adfa-founder-pandemic-prevention-one-of-best-things-we-can-do-for-future-generations/)
.

White House spokesperson Robyn Patterson said any claim that U.S. officials [announced](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-europe-congress-government-and-politics-f72e45a5229fa311819b83dcbb2e5216)
 earlier this month the country will send $400 million more in military aid to Ukraine, including funding for ammunition and air defense systems."

Content: "<image:8705>](https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Claim%20-%20Fact%20US%20Ukraine%20Support%202.0_0.png)

**US aid to Ukraine does not lack oversight nor has corruption in Ukraine diverted it.**

Claim: _US aid to Ukraine lacks oversight and is being misused because of corruption in Ukraine._

Fact: US oversight is extensive, and Ukrainian government oversight and accountability is extensive and growing.

*   Critics point to a recent corruption case in which a small Ukrainian defense enterprise embezzled $40 million from public ammunition procurement funds, **without noting that the Ukrainian government caught the thieves and recovered the money.****\[1\]**
*   Ukraine has undertaken significant anti-corruption efforts within its government and defense industrial base enterprises as part of efforts to increase domestic defense production.\[2\]
*   President Zelensky fired the previous defense minister after domestic corruption scandals unrelated to Western assistance emerged, and his replacement, the current minister, is aggressively rooting out corruption.\[3\] The Ukrainian government is also leveraging the robust and expansive Ukrainian NGO community to assist with its anti-corruption efforts.
*   Ukrainian and DoD personnel have been working aggressively to continue to improve monitoring and tracking of US aid, and US DoD officials have stated that there is no evidence that US-provided military assistance to Ukraine has been misappropriated.\[4\]
*   84% of the funds for Ukraine in the current proposed package would go to US companies, the US military, and other allied militaries, not Ukraine, which would get hardware and training from those funds.\[5\]
*   Western-provided weapons are being used as intended.  Mountains of evidence show advanced Western systems being used against Russian forces in Ukraine.\[6\]

**America’s NATO and Asian allies and other European states have committed more money to support Ukraine than the United States.**

Claim: _The United States is giving more support to Ukraine than Europe, and Europe hasn’t stepped up._

Fact: America’s European, Asian, and NATO allies have committed over $178 billion to support Ukraine, which is more than the US will have committed counting the aid package currently under consideration.

*   The EU and its member states have made available $148.5 billion (138 billion euros) - including its recently announced support package of $54 billion (50 billion euros) - to Ukraine since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022.\[7\]
*   The United Kingdom has pledged $15.1 billion (£12 billion) in overall support to Ukraine since February 2022, of which $9 billion (£7.1 billion) is for military assistance.\[8\]
*   Canada has committed $1.8 billion (over 2.4 billion Canadian dollars) in military assistance to Ukraine since February 2022.\[9\] The Canadian military has also has trained approximately 40,000 Ukrainian military and security personnel since 2015, and Canada expanded and extended this program until March 2026.
*   Norway reached a multi-year agreement with Ukraine in February 2023 for a support program that will provide Ukraine with $7 billion (75 billion Norwegian kroner) between 2023 and 2027.\[10\] Norway pledged to allocate to Ukraine around $1.4 billion (15 billion Norwegian kroner) per year and had already provided around one billion dollars (10.7 billion Norwegian kroner) to Ukraine in 2022 and about $1.9 billion (19.9 billion Norwegian kroner) in 2023.
*   NATO member Turkey is building a new drone production facility and service center in Ukraine. <image:8706>

*   Australia provided approximately $590 million (910 million Australian dollars) in overall military and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine as of late October 2023.\[17\]
*   New Zealand provided Ukraine with more than $48.7 million (80 million New Zealand dollars) in military and humanitarian assistance as of July 2023.\[18\]

**Ukraine is not a “forever war” for the United States because Americans are not fighting this war.**

Claim: _Ukraine is another 'forever war' for the United States._

Fact: This is not an American war.  It’s another nation’s war against an American enemy.

*   Ukrainians are fighting this war, not Americans.
*   The US is helping Ukraine fend off the Russian attack to reduce the risk that the US will have to fight Russia in the future. 
*   A Putin victory over Ukraine would embolden him and encourage him to test America’s willingness to defend its NATO allies, increasing the risk of a US-Russia war.\[19\]
*   Russian victory would also let Russian forces move closer to current NATO borders, forcing the US to commit more troops to the defense of its NATO allies.\[20\]
*   Ukraine is building up its own military and defense industry to be able to reduce its dependence on the US and will be able to do so if the US continues its support.\[21\]
*   Ukraine already has a significant defense industry and was one of the world’s leading weapons suppliers before the Russian invasions and is investing its own money and attracting foreign investors to dramatically increase this capability.\[22\]

**Sending military aid to Ukraine increases America’s military readiness and reduces the risk that the United States will have to fight Russia itself.**

Claim: _Sending military aid to Ukraine degrades America's military readiness_.

Fact: Sending military aid to Ukraine has enabled the United States to modernize its own military to be better prepared to fight the next war.

*   The US is supporting Ukraine in part so that the US won’t have to fight Russia itself.
*   The overwhelming majority of military assistance is going to build up the US defense industrial base.\[23\]  It is allowing the expansion of current production lines of essential military supplies that the US military will need in any future war.
*   The equipment the US has been giving Ukraine is mostly old and sometimes inoperable.\[24\]  The US is purchasing new systems to replace what it gives Ukraine, modernizing the American military in the process.
*   American allies are also reinvigorating their defense industries and modernizing their militaries as consequences of support to Ukraine, which benefits the US.\[25\]

**The United States is not sending Ukraine a “blank check.”**

Claim: _The United States is/was sending Ukraine a "blank check."_

Fact: The United States has not given Ukraine a blank check. [Skip to main content](#main-content)

The SBU said defence officials signed a contract for 100,000 mortar shells in August 2022, but no arms were ever provided

**Ukraine's security service says it has uncovered corruption in an arms purchase by the military worth about $40m (£31m).**

The SBU said five senior people in the defence ministry and at an arms supplier were being investigated.

It said the defence officials signed a contract for 100,000 mortar shells in August 2022.

Payment was made in advance, with some funds transferred abroad, but no arms were ever provided.

Corruption has been a major stumbling block in Ukraine's bid to join the European Union.

The SBU said an investigation had "exposed" officials of the ministry of defence and managers of arms supplier Lviv Arsenal, "who stole nearly 1.5 billion hryvnias in the purchase of shells".

"According to the investigation, former and current high-ranking officials of the Ministry of Defence and heads of affiliated companies are involved in the embezzlement," it said.

The SBU said that despite the contract for the shells having being agreed six months after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, "not a single artillery shell" was ever sent.

One of the suspects was detained while attempting to leave Ukraine and is currently in custody, the SBU said.

Ukraine's prosecutor general says the stolen funds have been seized and will be returned to the defence budget.

Issues surrounding corruption have dogged Ukraine for years.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky cited the fight against corruption as one of his main priorities when he came to power in 2019.

The latest allegations come as Republicans in the United States push back on President Joe Biden's efforts to send more aid to Ukraine.

In August, President Zelensky fired all the officials in charge of military recruitment to end a system in which some people were being allowed to escape conscription.

Ukraine was ranked 116th out of 180 countries in a [2022 corruption perceptions index](https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2022)
 by campaigning and research organisation Transparency International.

But anti-corruption efforts are beginning to make a difference.

Content: "REUTERS [Purchase Licensing Rights, opens new tab](https://www.reutersagency.com/en/licensereuterscontent/?utm_medium=rcom-article-media&utm_campaign=rcom-rcp-lead)

Posts shared on Facebook allege that former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick has threatened to leave the United States “because of Trump supporters.” Though intended as satire, several users seem to have taken this seriously.

Examples of posts making this claim can be found [here](https://www.facebook.com/ALLODSatire2/posts/3020933381475578)
; , [here](https://www.facebook.com/art.jones.5/posts/3303647453036654)
 and [here](https://www.facebook.com/janyerdominguez/posts/10222928231691306)
 .

Kaepernick last played in the NFL in 2016, the year when he sparked national controversy for taking a knee during the national anthem as a protest against racial inequality and police brutality in the United States. You are good for nothing!”

The post on  “America – Love It Or Leave It” includes a link to a Daily World Update article ( [here](https://dailyworldupdate.us/colin-kaepernick-threatens-to-leave-america-because-of-trump-supporters/?fbclid=IwAR08AjXhxrjWZP2aHoDuhaORlUQrQkRXYuukngmkTvcAK3-GS2FmUXRLYbE)
 ) with the headline “Colin Kaepernick Threatens To Leave America Because of Trump Supporters.” As stated in the website’s “About” section ( [dailyworldupdate.us/about/](https://dailyworldupdate.us/about/)
 ), “DailyWorldUpdate.us is a subsidiary of the ‘America’s Last Line of Defense’ network of parody, satire, and tomfoolery.” It notes that “everything on this website is fiction. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined.”

Text in the article itself ( [here](https://dailyworldupdate.us/colin-kaepernick-threatens-to-leave-america-because-of-trump-supporters/?fbclid=IwAR08AjXhxrjWZP2aHoDuhaORlUQrQkRXYuukngmkTvcAK3-GS2FmUXRLYbE)
 )  also suggests that the story is satirical. The claim that Colin Kaepernick has threatened to leave the United States because of Trump supporters originated in a clearly satirical article on the website DailyWorldUpdate.us.

This article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team. Some fans praised Kaepernick and other players joined him in the protest, but his action was criticized by President Donald as unpatriotic.

The posts making the claim were posted on Oct. For example, it quotes a Kaepernick spokesman as saying that the former NFL player “loves America and would never think about leaving,” then adds, “not to mention no other country will have Americans because Trump screwed up so much that the world thinks we’re walking infection machines.”

VERDICT

Satire."

Russia's 2016 disinformation campaign sought to leverage the NFL national anthem kneeling controversy as part of a broader effort to divide the US and inflame racial divisions, according to [the second volume of the Senate Intelligence Committee's report](https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Report_Volume2.pdf)
 on Russian election interference, which was released on Tuesday.

The report said that the focus on the NFL kneeling controversy went well beyond 2016 and continued as late as March 2018. 

It's been previously reported that Russian trolls [continued efforts to divide the US after Election Day 2016](https://www.businessinsider.com/new-knowledge-oxford-reports-russia-disinformation-campaign-senate-intelligence-committee-2018-12)
, and that [the NFL has been a big target](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-russian-trolls-inflamed-nfls-anthem-controversy-1540233979)
, but the second volume of the Senate Intelligence Committee report builds on the extent to which race and the national anthem kneeling debate were part of the disinformation campaign. 

"The Committee found that no single group of Americans was targeted by IRA information operatives more than African-Americans," the report said. "By far, race and related issues were the preferred target of the information warfare campaign designed to divide the country in 2016."

_

The Internet Research Agency, the notorious Russian troll farm at the center of these efforts, "heavily focused on hotbutton issues with racial undertones, such as the NFL kneeling protests."

This included references to Colin Kaepernick, the quarterback who garnered national attention for kneeling during the national anthem and was ostracized by the league as a result. 

"A Left Troll account, @wokeluisa, tweeted in support of Colin Kaepernick and tje NFL protests on March 13, 2018, prompting 37,000 forwarded retweets," the report said. "Simultaneous to this, and in .the direction of the ideologically opposite audience, @BarbaraForTrump, a Right Troll account, was tweeting content hostile to the protests."

The Senate Intelligence Committee "found that IRA activity on social media did not cease, but rather increased after Election Day 2016."

Russia's efforts to interfere in the 2016 election has been among the most divisive topics in Washington since the last presidential election. An assessment from US intelligence agencies found that Russia [interfered in the election under the orders of Russian President Vladimir Putin](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-russia-cyber-idUSKBN14Q1T8)
 with the intention of boosting [Donald Trump's](https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-donald-trump-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-4)
 chances of winning by maligning former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. 

Despite the intelligence community's findings and [continued warnings about the Kremlin's ongoing efforts](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-intelligence-officials-warn-of-pervasive-russian-efforts-to-disrupt-2018-elections-1533235652)
 to intervene in the US electoral process, Trump has expressed skepticism that Russia interfered in the 2016 election and downplayed the issue at times. 

Former special counsel Robert Mueller, who conducted an extensive investigation on Russia's efforts and issued a 448-page report on this, concluded that Russia [sought to help Trump](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/07/24/two-big-mueller-exchanges-that-capture-russia-scandal/)
 and that there ["were multiple, systematic efforts to interfere in our election."](https://twitter.com/CNNPolitics/status/1133756208584822786)

Mueller did not, however, find sufficient evident that the Trump campaign "conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities." Though the former special counsel declined to reach a conclusion on whether Trump committed obstruction of justice in the process of the inquiry, he also did not exonerate the president on the matter and outlined [11 possible instances of obstruction](https://www.businessinsider.com/barr-mueller-report-10-instances-obstruction-of-justice-press-conference-2019-4)
. 

The Mueller probe catalyzed further inquires by House Democrats in Congress and continues to be mentioned in [discussions on the escalating Ukraine scandal](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/464845-house-lawyer-says-impeachment-probe-could-go-beyond-ukraine)
 that's sparked an [impeachment inquiry into Trump.](https://www.businessinsider.com/nancy-pelosi-announce-trump-impeachment-inquiry-2019-9)

Since 2016, the eyes of the world have been on Colin Kaepernick. Pro-Trump accounts on Twitter helped to drive the campaign to boycott Nike once it named Kaepernick as the face of its Just Do It advertising campaign, new analysis shows.

Twitter activity around the protests also shows accounts believed to be linked to Russia's ongoing disinformation campaign helped to amplify the anti-Nike sentiment. This was followed by #nike, #colinkaepernick, #boycottnike, #kaepernick and #dumpnikestock, which all had more than 1,000 uses. A limited number of tweets led to [widespread](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/colin-kaepernick-nike-campaign-social-media-reaction)
 press coverage of protests.

The attempted boycott has worked out well for Nike. Mark Parker, the company's chief executive, said that customers responded "quite strongly" to the Kaepernick advertisement.

"Like many campaigns, it's driving a real uptick in traffic and engagement, both socially as well as commercially," Parker was reported as saying by the [_BBC_](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-45643845)
.

Graphika says Russian Twitter accounts targeted the Nike boycott but did not create it. [_CNN_ has previously reported](https://money.cnn.com/2018/09/08/technology/nfl-national-anthem-russia-trolls/index.html)
 on Russian links to online criticism of Kaepernick.

"Our understanding of how the Russians work – not just in the American political environment but in Europe and elsewhere – is they embed these sock puppet assets into the natural political landscape of the country they are trying to influence," Kelly says. Graphika says the online movement spread, this group grew from 18 per cent of hashtag uses to 21 per cent and largely was reacting to the pro-Trump group.

Data from analysts at [Brandwatch](https://www.brandwatch.com/blog/react-nike-colin-kaepernick-just-do-it-ad/)
 found that from September 2 to September 4 mentions of "Just Do It" increased by more than 3,460 per cent and Nike's overall online sentiment dropped after it released the ad. As the national anthem played, Kaepernick [remained sitting on the bench](https://www.prweek.com/article/1407098/nfl-49ers-tread-sensitive-line-kaepernick-controversy)
 in protest at the oppression of black people in the US.

The protest was the first of many, with Kaepernick and other players subsequently taking the knee. The first scan, conducted within hours after Nike named Kaepernick as the face of its new advert on September 3, found around 7,000 to 8,000 accounts using the initial hashtags calling for a boycott of Nike.

Kelly says that around 12-18 hours later when the second scan was conducted there were more than 80,000 different Twitter accounts that had posted messages with the hashtags."

But as they meet for the third time this year at the White House, the outwardly triumphant visit will be dogged by [Israel's 21-month war against Hamas in Gaza](https://www.cbsnews.com/israel-gaza-conflict/)

"I think that the discussion with President Trump can certainly help advance that result, which all of us hope for," Netanyahu said.

Israel and Hamas appear to be inching toward a new ceasefire agreement that would bring about a 60-day pause in the fighting, send aid flooding into Gaza and free at least some of the remaining 50 hostages held in the territory, 20 of whom Netanyahu says are still alive.

_Tel Aviv, Israel_ — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Trump sought to take a victory lap Monday after their recent joint strikes on Iran, hailed by both as an unmitigated success. Trump seemed less certain of the chances of an imminent breakthrough.

Asked on Friday how confident he was that a ceasefire deal would come together, he told reporters: "I'm very optimistic — but you know, look, it changes from day to day."

On Sunday evening, he seemed to narrow his expectations, telling reporters that he thought an agreement related to the remaining hostages would be reached in the coming week.

    North America correspondent
    
    One explanation for Donald Trump’s unexpected and expansive proposal for resolving the Gaza situation is that he is a second-term president and, like many of his predecessors, his thoughts are increasingly turning to how the history books will remember him.
    
    An area where presidents typically have broad authority, and can burnish their legacy, is foreign policy.
    
    With narrow majorities in Congress, any legislation Trump supports in the months ahead is going to face a tough road to passage – and will probably include sometimes unpleasant compromises.
    
    With each passing day, Trump’s domestic authority will diminish, as his own party begins to look toward first toward next year’s midterm congressional elections and, ultimately, to a new standard-bearer in the 2028 presidential contest.
    
    A dramatic foreign policy breakthrough, however, is something Trump and his White House team could seek on their own – akin to Ronald Reagan’s negotiations with the Soviets in his second term or Bill Clinton’s ill-fated Wye River meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Yasser Arafat’s Palestinian Authority.
    
    The Middle East isn’t Trump’s only foreign policy interest – his ongoing ambitions for acquiring Greenland, for instance, signal an alternative avenue for legacy-building.
    
    But his successful brokering of the Abraham Accords at the end of his first term may give him reason to think he can pull off another diplomatic success in the region, even if his first steps in that direction this time around have already met stiff resistance.

    A little earlier, we heard from White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, who insists that Trump has "made it clear" that he will not be sending US troops to Gaza.
    
    When asked about American troops' involvement in Gaza during yesterday's daily press briefing, she said Trump had "not committed to putting boots on the ground".
    
    This lack of a definitive answer from Leavitt has changed today, following on from reiterations from both Trump and [Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu that no US troops will be "on the ground"](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/cvg4zwwez9et?post=asset%3A632187dc-187f-4ac2-bab1-d1509e7e38b4#post)

14. Trump's former national security adviser, John Bolton, tells the BBC that the president's proposal to redevelop Gaza into the "Riviera of the Middle East" is "just isn't going to happen".
    
    He says the US role in such a plan would have to be between "slim and none" because "you can't put Americans in that kind of security environment without military protection and that just isn't going to happen".
    
    But he does suggest Palestinians in Gaza be offered resettlement.
    
    "Rebuilding a high-rise refugee camp is not an answer," he says, suggesting instead the possibility of "some kind of resettlement which would not be forcible but which would be consistent with international refugee doctrine".
    
    He is critical of Trump's approach of making such an announcement "without consulting with anybody".
    
    Reflecting on his time working for Trump in the White House, he says: “It’s very difficult. Gaza is Palestinian.

    We have now have further details of the order itself - in which the president accuses the court of engaging in "illegitimate and baseless actions" targeting both America and Israel.
    
    The order sets out: "The ICC has, without a legitimate basis, asserted jurisdiction over and opened preliminary investigations concerning personnel of the United States and certain of its allies, including Israel, and has further abused its power by issuing baseless arrest warrants targeting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Former Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant."
    
    The US "remains committed to accountability," it adds, as well as "international order".
    
    As a reminder, neither the US nor Israel are members of the ICC.

A meeting between [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump)
 and [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://www.theguardian.com/world/volodymyr-zelenskiy)
 veered sharply off track in front of the television cameras as the US president [berated his Ukrainian counterpart](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/28/trump-zelenskyy-meeting-ukraine-aid-war)
 then abruptly called off a minerals deal with that he had said would be the first step towards a ceasefire with Russia.

Here are the highlights, word-for-word, of the conversation between Trump, Zelenskyy and Vice-President [JD Vance](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jd-vance)
 in the Oval Office.

**Zelenskyy**: What kind of diplomacy, JD, are you are asking about? I will say that.

**Trump, raising his voice**: You’re in no position to dictate what we’re going to feel. We’re going to feel very good and very strong.

_Zelenskyy tries to_ _speak._

**Trump**: You right now are not in a very good position. With us, you start having the cards.

You’re gambling with lives of millions of people, you’re gambling with world war three and what you’re doing is very disrespectful to this country.

**Vance**: Have you said thank you once?

**Zelenskyy**: A lot of times.

**Vance**: No, in this meeting, this entire meeting? Offer some words of appreciation for the United States of America and the president who’s trying to save your country.

**Zelenskyy**: Yes, you think that if you will speak very loudly about the war …

**Trump**: He’s not speaking loud. Your country is in big trouble.

**Zelenskyy**: I know, I know.

**Trump**: You’re not winning this. You have a damn good chance of coming out OK, because of us.

**Zelenskyy**: We are staying strong from the very beginning of the war, we have been alone, and we are saying, I said, thanks.

**Trump, speaking over Zelenskyy**: You haven’t been alone … We gave you military equipment. If you didn’t have our military equipment, this war would have been over in two weeks.

**Zelenskyy**: I heard it from Putin in three days.

**Trump**: It’s going to be a very hard thing to do business like this.

**Vance**: Just say thank you.

**Zelenskyy**: I said it a lot of times.

**Vance**: Accept that there are disagreements and let’s go litigate those disagreements rather than trying to fight it in the American media, when you’re wrong. What do you mean?

**Vance**: I’m talking about the kind of diplomacy that’s going to end the destruction of your country.

**Zelenskyy**: Yes, but if you …

**Vance**: Mr President, with respect, I think it’s disrespectful for you to come to the Oval Office and try to litigate this in front of the American media."

[\[54\]](#cite_note-Oliphant-54)
[\[55\]](#cite_note-55)
 Zelenskyy continued, stating that in 2019, he [negotiated a ceasefire](/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War#2019–2020 "Russo-Ukrainian War")
 with Putin, Macron, and German chancellor [Angela Merkel](/wiki/Angela_Merkel "Angela Merkel")

[\[54\]](#cite_note-Oliphant-54)
[\[41\]](#cite_note-Bennett-41)

Vance conversing with Zelenskyy

At that point, the conversation became hostile and continually escalated.[\[47\]](#cite_note-Gomez-47)
[\[53\]](#cite_note-Zeleny-53)
 Vance replied that he was discussing "diplomacy that's going to end the destruction of Ukraine", telling Zelenskyy, "I think it's disrespectful for you to come to the Oval Office and try to litigate this in front of the American media. I'm the president in a war", while Trump retorted, "You're gambling with millions of lives, you are gambling with [World War Three](/wiki/World_War_III "World War III")
 \[...\] and what you're doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country, that's backed you far more than a lot of people said they should have."[\[62\]](#cite_note-63)

Vance questioned if Zelenskyy had ever offered thanks, despite Zelenskyy starting the conversation by saying "Thank you so much" to Trump.[\[63\]](#cite_note-64)
 Vance falsely accused Zelenskyy of "\[having gone\] to Pennsylvania and campaigned for [the opposition](/wiki/Kamala_Harris_2024_presidential_campaign "Kamala Harris 2024 presidential campaign")
 in October \[2024\]". [Jump to content](#bodyContent)

 at the [White House](/wiki/White_House "White House")
 in [Washington, D.C.](/wiki/Washington,_D.C. support for Ukraine](/wiki/United_States_and_the_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine "United States and the Russian invasion of Ukraine")

; however, the meeting ended abruptly and without a clear resolution.[\[2\]](#cite_note-2)
[\[3\]](#cite_note-3)

[\[5\]](#cite_note-CNN-5)

Leading up to the meeting, there were tensions between the Trump administration and Zelenskyy's government. allies, along with other global figures, swiftly voiced their support for Zelenskyy following the meeting,[\[9\]](#cite_note-PoliticoEu-9)

In the aftermath of the meeting, the Trump administration suspended the provision of intelligence and military aid to Ukraine for around a week. The aid was resumed after Zelenskyy agreed to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire, contingent on Russian approval; as Russia rejected the proposal, the ceasefire did not ultimately materialize.[\[15\]](#cite_note-Klepper-15)

Ukrainian lawmakers protest with placards before a vote replacing a law that attempted to curb the powers of anticorruption bodies, in Kyiv, on July 31, 2025 \[Andrii Nesterenko/AFP\]

Published On 2 Aug 20252 Aug 2025

Ukrainian authorities have detained several officials over a “large-scale corruption scheme” in the defence sector, just days after lawmakers restored the independence of the country’s two main investigative bodies.

The National Anti-Corruption Agency (NABU) and the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office (SAP) said in a joint statement on Saturday that they made four arrests in connection with the scheme, which involved the procurement of military drones and signal jamming systems.

“The essence of the scheme was to conclude state contracts with supplier companies at deliberately inflated prices,” they said, adding that the suspects had received kickbacks of up to 30 percent of the contract amounts.

NABU and SAPO said they had caught a sitting lawmaker, two local officials and an unspecified number of National Guard personnel taking bribes. The suspects were not identified in Saturday’s statement.

The Ministry of Internal Affairs also said it had suspended the suspected National Guard members.

The announcement comes after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy came under criticism last month for [trying to take away](/news/2025/7/29/why-zelenskyy-tried-to-curb-autonomy-of-ukraines-anticorruption-agencies)
 the anticorruption agencies’ independence and place them under the control of his prosecutor-general.

The agencies regained their autonomy after Zelenskyy’s move sparked the first antigovernment demonstrations in Ukraine since Russia invaded in 2022.

Zelenskyy, who enjoys far-reaching wartime powers, initially said he needed to bring the agencies under his control because they were inefficient and under “Russian influence”.

But he then said he had heard people’s anger and [submitted a bill](/news/2025/7/24/ukraines-zelenskyy-introduces-new-draft-law-after-anticorruption-protests)
 restoring the agencies’ independence, which was [passed by lawmakers](/news/2025/7/31/ukraine-parliament-votes-to-restore-anti-corruption-agencies-after-protests)
 on Thursday.

“It is important that anticorruption institutions operate independently, and the law passed on Thursday guarantees them all the tools necessary for a real fight against corruption,” Zelenskyy said.

Ukraine’s European allies praised the about-face, having voiced concerns about the original defanging of the agencies.

Top officials had told Zelenskyy that Ukraine was jeopardising its bid for European Union membership by curbing the powers of its antigraft authorities.

In a statement about Saturday’s arrests, Zelenskyy said he was “grateful to the anti-corruption agencies for their work”.

Ukraine’s anti-corruption agencies exposed a corruption scheme involving procurement of military equipment just two days after the parliament reinstated their independence following mass protests and pressure from Brussels.

The National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) and Special Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office (SABO) discovered a “large-scale corruption scheme” that exploited budget funds allocated for defense forces, the agencies said [in a statement](https://t.me/nab_ukraine/3312)
 on Saturday.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the scheme "absolutely immoral,” in a [Telegram post](https://t.me/s/V_Zelenskiy_official)
. None of them were named in the statement.

The corruption involved purchasing equipment [at knowingly inflated prices](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/ukraine-says-it-uncovers-major-drone-procurement-corruption-scheme-2025-08-02/)
 for which the participants illegally received 30 percent of the contract amount, according to the agencies. A similar approach was used in FPV drone procurement, the agencies said.

The revelation by the [anti-corruption agencies](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/08/02/europe/ukraine-corruption-drone-scheme-latam-intl)
 comes after the Ukrainian leadership attempted to subject the oversight of the bodies to the politically appointed prosecutor general of Ukraine. Those involved "were exposed for taking bribes," he said.

The NABU and the SABO said [the scheme included](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20250802-ukraine-anti-corruption-agencies-uncover-major-drone-procurement-graft-scheme)
 a serving member of parliament, regional officials, the head of a unit of the National Guard’s military unit and a director of a company supplying drones. Zelenskyy signed a bill into law on Thursday that [restored independence](https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-protests-volodymyr-zelenskyy-kyiv-power-politics-corruption/)
 to the agencies.

“There can only be zero tolerance for corruption, clear teamwork to expose corruption, and ultimately a fair sentence," Zelenskyy [wrote](https://t.me/V_Zelenskiy_official/15416)
 on Telegram on Saturday. "It is important that anti-corruption institutions work independently, and [the law adopted on Thursday](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gq3xwr357o)
 guarantees them all the opportunities for a real fight against corruption,” he said.

He called for [full and fair accountability](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2025/08/02/ukraine-uncovers-drone-procurement-corruption-scheme/)
. 

“We are counting on fair verdicts,” Zelenskyy said in an [official statement](https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/rosiya-zatyaguye-vijnu-otzhe-bude-otrimuvati-spravedlivi-vid-99281)
 late Saturday. He said only combat officers will hold leadership positions in all logistics units of the National Guard. 

Zelenskyy reinstated the independence of the NABU and the SAPO after domestic protests and a [warning](https://www.politico.eu/article/ursula-von-der-leyen-volodymyr-zelenskyy-europe-ukraine-anti-corruption-watchdog-independence/)
 from European Commission that Ukraine's EU bid was put at risk."

By [Hanna Duggal](/author/duggalhaljazeera-net)

Published On 21 Aug 202521 Aug 2025

After a week of high-stakes diplomacy aimed at halting the war in Ukraine, United States President Donald Trump says he is set on arranging a summit between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Following separate meetings with both leaders, Trump has ruled out sending US troops to Ukraine, but pledged security guarantees to Kyiv and indicated that Washington could provide air support to reinforce a potential deal.

Ukraine, in turn, told reporters at the White House it would obtain US-made weapons purchased by Europeans for an estimated $90bn as part of the effort to bolster its defences.

Which countries are aiding Ukraine?
-----------------------------------

At least 41 countries have contributed to Ukraine’s war efforts monetarily, either through military, humanitarian or financial assistance, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German think tank.

Military assistance includes weapons, equipment and financial aid for the Ukrainian military. These include Australia, Austria, Cyprus, the Republic of Ireland, Japan, Malta, New Zealand, South Korea, Switzerland, China, Taiwan, and India.

The European Union, through the Commission and Council, has also delivered substantial aid to Ukraine.

![INTERACTIVE - Which countries are aiding Ukraine?-1755767959](/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/INTERACTIVE-Which-countries-are-aiding-Ukraine-1755767959.png?quality=80)

How much aid has Ukraine received so far?
-----------------------------------------

So far, Ukraine has received more than 309 billion euros ($360bn) in military, financial, and humanitarian aid, according to the Kiel Institute:

*   **Military aid** – 149.26 billion euros ($174bn – using today’s exchange rate of €1 = $1.17)
*   **Financial aid** – 139.34 billion euros ($163bn)
*   **Humanitarian aid** – 21.04 billion euros ($24bn)

Who are Ukraine’s largest donors?
---------------------------------

The US has committed the largest amount of aid to Ukraine, providing 114.64 billion euros ($134bn) between January 24, 2022 and June 30, 2025, of which:

*   **Military aid** – 64.6 billion euros ($75bn)
*   **Financial aid** – 46.6 billion euros ($54bn)
*   **Humanitarian aid** – 3.4 billion euros ($4bn)

The EU (Commission and Council) is the second biggest donor at 63.19 billion euros ($74bn), followed by Germany (21.29 billion euros or $25bn), the UK (18.6 billion euros or $21bn) and Japan (13.57 billion euros or $15bn).

How much aid has been pledged v allocated?
------------------------------------------

According to the Kiel Institute, European countries have collectively allocated 167.4 billion euros ($195bn) to the war in Ukraine, more than the 114.6 billion euros ($134bn) allocated by the US.

Allocated aid refers to funds or resources that have actually been set aside, delivered, or officially committed for use by Ukraine.

It is different from pledged aid, which is money or equipment promised by a country but not yet delivered or officially set aside.

In total, Europe as a whole has committed 257.4 billion euros ($300bn) and the US 119 billion euros ($139bn).

US aid to Ukraine plummets under Trump
--------------------------------------

Days before Trump took office, the Biden administration gave one final injection of military support to Ukraine with a weapons package of $500m on January 9.

Following the start of the Trump administration’s second term in office, aid to Ukraine has plummeted, with Washington suspending all support, including weapons, in March after a tense meeting with Zelenskyy at the White House.

Trump made claims that the US has given Ukraine more than $300bn in wartime aid. That number has been contested by Ukraine and its supporters, despite the US being the single largest donor country.

What weapons has Ukraine received?
----------------------------------

Ukraine has received various weapons systems from its allies, including armoured vehicles, artillery, aircraft, air defence systems, drones, missiles, and a wide range of support equipment.

According to the Kiel Institute, Poland has supplied its neighbour with the largest number of tanks, totaling 354, while the US leads in providing infantry fighting vehicles (305), howitzers (201), air defence systems (18), and HIMARS rocket launchers (41).

The HIMARS, capable of striking targets just a few metres (feet) wide from nearly 80km (50 miles) away, gave Ukraine a vital long-range precision strike capability that slowed Russian advances early in the war.

NATO defence spending
---------------------

In a news briefing, the White House said the US could help coordinate a security guarantee for Ukraine. Humanitarian relief covers medical, food and other items for civilians, while financial assistance comes in the form of grants, loans and guarantees.

Most contributions to Ukraine have come from NATO, with 29 of its 32 members providing monetary aid, according to the Kiel Institute.

Additionally, 12 non-NATO countries and territories have sent monetary aid to Ukraine. However, Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has ruled out the deployment of troops from NATO countries to help secure a peace deal.

In June, NATO leaders signed a deal to increase defence spending, which is to be achieved over the next 10 years, and is a jump worth hundreds of billions of dollars a year from the current goal of 2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) to 5 percent.

Currently, 23 of the 32 member countries have met this target, with the alliance as a whole spending 2.61 percent of its combined GDP on defence last year.

NATO countries bordering Russia, such as Estonia and Lithuania, have significantly increased their defence spending – from less than 1 percent of their GDP just 10 years ago.

A main aim of this database to quantify the scale of aid to Ukraine and to make the support measures comparable across donor countries. Much of the discussion on aid to Ukraine since the beginning of the war has been anecdotal, while a rigorous quantification has been missing. To value these, we draw on a broad range of sources to identify market prices, choosing an upper bound, when possible, e.g., by using the new purchase price even if much of the military equipment is probably used.

The Ukraine Support Tracker lists and quantifies military, financial, and humanitarian aid pledged to Ukraine since January 24, 2022. *   [Go to main content.](#main "Go to main content.")

A Database of Military, Financial and Humanitarian Aid to Ukraine
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The Ukraine Support Tracker lists and quantifies military, financial and humanitarian support by governments to Ukraine since February 2022. The database is intended to support a facts-based discussion about support to Ukraine. 

We focus on government-to-government transfers into Ukraine. This means that Europe now also leads the US in terms of total volume of military aid provided through industry since the start of the war. To do so, we set up a comprehensive database that brings together information from official, government sources, existing lists of Ukraine aid, and reports by renowned news media.

An important challenge is to **quantify non-financial transfers**, such as in-kind shipments of military equipment, weapons, medicines or foodstuff. We have also not (yet) systematically collected support by international organizations like the Red Cross or the United Nations, mainly because a lack of systematic data and reporting by most such international organizations.

The Ukraine Support Tracker is constantly being expanded, corrected and improved. Suggestions are very welcome and can be sent to [ukrainetracker@ifw-kiel.de](#)

Future trends in arms trafficking from the Ukraine conflict

*   [](https://globalinitiative.net/crime_type/arms-trafficking/)
    
*   [](https://globalinitiative.net/crime_type/violence-fragility/)
    

*   [! What this means for organized crime, and specifically the smuggling of weapons and ammunition into Europe is unclear, but by using scenario modelling we can divine insights and provide concrete recommendations.

On 20–21 January 2025, the GI-TOC hosted a conference in Brussels to discuss three potential trajectories of the Russo-Ukrainian conflict and the ramifications of each on arms trafficking dynamics in Europe.

The conference gamed three scenarios – a peace agreement, a stalemate conflict and a decisive victory for Ukraine or Russia. Some leakage must be expected, and understanding this reality should persuade policymakers to act sooner rather than wait for a trigger event in a European city.

#### Key points

*   Draft, support and implement policy measures that reduce arms trafficking risks in Ukraine, including (when it is formulated) Ukraine’s demobilization law, and its security sector reform and veteran policy.
*   Improve Europe-wide operational capabilities in terms of information sharing, coordination and access to data.
*   The arms trafficking trade is likely to be multifaceted: a small-scale trade to European organized crime, and a larger volume trade to other regions (Africa, Latin America, Middle East, Central Asia), potentially to conflict actors.
*   ‘Traditional’ organized crime may be involved in arms trafficking alongside other more lucrative activities, like the drug trade, but ex-military personnel may form a new class of ‘brokers’, using connections with other military and politicians to set up larger-scale operations.
*   Tailor responses that recognize demand is king: the right kit for the right customer. Participants were asked to respond, from the perspective of organized crime, law enforcement and multilateral policymakers, to emergent arms trafficking dynamics, working through various turns to discover second- and third-order implications. Asking participants to step outside their role and think like a criminal is rewarding and illuminates the discussion, while building trust and personal connections.

The purpose of this exercise was to provide policymakers with a forward-looking perspective that would map the potential risk of arms trafficking across a range of situations, point up gaps in responses and develop specific and measurable policy response options for national authorities to implement with the aim of reducing the risks of illicit firearms markets in Europe from the conflict.

Fostering international cooperation and information-sharing was also a primary goal of the conference. More than 60 high-level stakeholders attended from a range of organizations focusing on arms trafficking.

#### Understanding the risk

Understanding of the risks of arms trafficking arising from the conflict has improved since the Russian invasion in February 2022. Yet recent research suggests criminal groups are establishing more organized arms trafficking markets, routes and supply chains, and the scale of the problem is much larger than past occurrences of large-scale diversion, such as the Balkans and Afghanistan. Experts and policymakers in neighbouring and other European countries continue to express their concerns about the threat of large-scale diversion of small arms and light weapons (SALW) and ammunition from Ukraine. An overarching conclusion was that policy responses must flexible and scalable from the start.

**Use lessons learned (and learn new ones)**

The conference highlighted the fact that many policy bodies in Europe have a deep and multilayered understanding of the legacy of the Balkans conflict on arms trafficking trends in Europe. While Ukraine has already benefited from a preventative approach informed by that experience, more can be done to apply the lessons learnt from old conflicts and adapt to the new illicit firearm types, such as converted blank guns, reactivated firearms and 3D-printed guns."

# Your Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime published an article discussing future trends in arms trafficking from the Ukraine conflict. The article mentions that criminal groups are establishing more organized arms trafficking markets, routes, and supply chains. It also states that the arms trafficking trade is likely to be multifaceted, including a small-scale trade to European organized crime and a larger volume trade to other regions (Africa, Latin America, Middle East, Central Asia), potentially to conflict actors. The article does not mention Ukraine selling armaments.

The aid includes military, financial, and humanitarian aid, as well as various weapons systems from allies.

Forumarmstrade.org lists military aid packages to Ukraine from various countries, including the United States, Germany, France, and others. The aid includes artillery shells, ammunition, air defense systems, drones, and other military equipment. The document does not mention Ukraine selling armaments.

## Elaboration
The evidence reveals instances of corruption within Ukraine's defense sector, including inflated prices and kickbacks on procurement contracts. There is also evidence of past illicit arms sales and theft of military assets. However, the provided sources do not directly support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States.

To verify the claim, information is needed on the volume of arms received from the US, the volume of arms sold by Ukraine, and evidence linking the two.

### MoIA Launches the Coordination Centre to Combat Illicit Arms Trafficking

February 06, 2025

The inaugural meeting of the Coordination Centre for Combating Illicit Trafficking in Firearms, Their Parts and Components and Ammunition was held under the chairmanship of Ihor Klymenko, the Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, [reports](https://mvs.gov.ua/en/news/igor-klimenko-zapusk-koordinaciinogo-centru-z-pitan-protidiyi-nezakonnomu-obigu-zbroyi-nas-vnesok-u-rozbudovu-jevropeiskoyi-arxitekturi-bezpeki)
 the Communications Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine.

The event was also attended by Oleksii Serhieiev, the Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, Ivan Vyhivskyi, the Head of the National Police of Ukraine, representatives of the Office of the Prosecutor General, the Ministry of Defence, the Security Service of Ukraine, the State Bureau of Investigation, the Ministry of Strategic Industries of Ukraine, international organisations such as the OSCE, the European Union Advisory Mission Ukraine, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the Delegation of the European Union, and a member of the Ukrainian Parliament.

“Every day, law enforcement agencies seize weapons, explosives and ammunition from illicit trafficking, and border guards take exhaustive measures to prevent their trafficking across the state border. Taking into account the EU recommendations and ensuring the proper functioning of the Coordination Centre, we are making our contribution to the development of the European security architecture,” the Minister added.

In his turn, Ambassador Petr Mareš, Special Representative of the OSCE Chairmanship and Project Co-ordinator in Ukraine, said that the issue of arms trafficking is becoming increasingly acute due to russia’s full-scale invasion, but the creation of the Coordination Centre will help to effectively counteract this problem. Achieving synergy in combating illicit arms trafficking is of great importance to us, as we are aware that the war is ongoing, and only through joint efforts can we ensure security in Ukraine and Europe,” he said.

In response, the Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine stressed that, with the assistance of international partners, the Ministry of Internal Affairs is implementing a number of joint projects aimed at building the institutional capacity of law enforcement agencies.

Harshet Virk, the Head of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime Programme Office in Ukraine, stressed that owing to the coordinated and efficient efforts of Ukrainian law enforcement agencies, not a single weapon was trafficked to the European Union: “I sincerely congratulate you on the establishment of the Coordination Centre – this is an important step in the fight against crime and illicit arms trafficking. <image:13562>

Harshet Virk noted that her team will continue to support the initiatives of the Ministry of Internal Affairs by providing software and organising relevant trainings.

Maura O’Sullivan, the Acting Head of the EU Advisory Mission Ukraine, said that the Centre is a reliable solution for monitoring the situation in Ukraine, particularly in the area of combating illicit arms trafficking: “We are ready to continue to support you and facilitate the rapid exchange of information. The main tasks of the Centre are:

– processing and systematisation of information received;

– coordinating the actions of state authorities, institutions and organisations on combating illicit firearms trafficking;

– ensuring the exchange of information between the authorities of Ukraine and partner countries;

– obtaining complete information about weapons;

– improving the legal framework for combating illicit firearms trafficking;

– identifying ways and means of solving problematic issues.

As war rages on in Ukraine, organised crime is taking new forms
===============================================================

18 July 2025 [Law and Crime Prevention](/en/news/topic/law-and-crime-prevention)

Almost four years after Russia’s full-scale invasion, criminal groups in Ukraine are adapting their business models amid displacement, rising trafficking risks and an increased demand for synthetic drugs, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) said in a report published on Friday. 

Since February 2022, both legal and illegal economies in Ukraine have been severely disrupted by the war. 

The [report](https://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/Ukraine/Ukraine_OC_Study.pdf)
 examines the evolution of organised crime structures in the country and focuses on six distinct areas: drug trafficking and production, online scams and fraud, arms trafficking, economic crime, trafficking in persons, and the facilitation of illegal exit and draft evasion.

“The war has not only inflicted untold suffering on the Ukrainian people, but has also triggered a marked evolution in organised crime – which can have profound implications for the country’s journey towards recovery and reconstruction,” said Angela Me, Chief of Research and Analysis at [UNODC](https://www.unodc.org)
.

**Drug trafficking**
--------------------

While the trafficking of cocaine and heroin through Ukraine has decreased drastically since 2022, the production and trafficking of synthetic drugs such as cathinones and methadone have increased.

The expansion of cathinone trafficking in recent years has been facilitated by the darknet, notably through market platforms such as Hydra, which was dismantled in April 2022.

Regarding methadone, the report noted that most of the Ukrainian production is trafficked within the country and not abroad, as domestic demand for the drug is on the rise.

**Arms trafficking**
--------------------

The war has also increased the availability of weapons in the country, notably due to a massive influx of arms from the battlefield.

This surplus is resulting in a rise in arms seizures and violence among civilians, marked notably by an increase in domestic and intimate partner violence.

Although there is no evidence to suggest large-scale arms trafficking outside Ukraine, UNODC highlighted the importance of monitoring the situation in light of the sheer number of weapons available and the historic regional presence of criminal actors specialising in arms trafficking.

While there is, as of now, no evidence of drones being used in a non-military context, civilian drones and 3D-printed components for frontline attacks could fuel new illicit markets, the report found.

**Trafficking in persons**
--------------------------

As roughly 14 million people have been displaced by the war, some criminal groups have exploited these populations by luring them into shelters or accommodations disguised as humanitarian assistance providers, where they are subjected to forced labour.

While intensified patrolling of the borders, paired with the near-complete closure of the eastern and north-eastern borders, has limited the smuggling of migrants through Ukraine, traffickers have instead turned to facilitating draft evasion by Ukrainian men.

“Curtailing organised crime is a key requirement for achieving sustainable peace, justice, national security and the protection of human rights,” said Matthias Schmale, [UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Ukraine](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/profiles/matthias-schmale)
, as the global body stands ready to support the country in this critical work.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The new evidence continues to highlight concerns about arms trafficking and corruption within Ukraine's defense sector. However, it still does not provide any direct evidence to support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. The sources discuss the potential for arms trafficking and efforts to combat it, but they do not confirm the claim.

To verify the claim, specific data on the volume of arms received from the US, the volume of arms sold by Ukraine, and evidence linking the two is still needed.

## Elaboration
The new evidence continues to highlight concerns about arms trafficking and corruption within Ukraine's defense sector. However, it still does not provide any direct evidence to support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. The sources discuss the potential for arms trafficking and efforts to combat it, but they do not confirm the claim.

To verify the claim, specific data on the volume of arms received from the US, the volume of arms sold by Ukraine, and evidence linking the two is still needed.

Since Russia’s invasion in February 2022, Ukraine has become by far the top recipient of U.S. commitment has been called into question in 2025, with President Donald Trump freezing all military aid to Ukraine in early March, and then lifting the freeze shortly after, following cease-fire talks in Saudi Arabia.

This has been a familiar dynamic for the administration; in early July, the White House announced it would freeze the delivery of some weapons intended for Ukraine. Dozens of other countries, including most members of the [North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/what-nato "North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)")
 and European Union (EU), are also providing large aid packages to Ukraine.

In late 2024, the United States also provided the Ukrainian government with a $20 billion loan, funded by interest generated from frozen Russian assets.

It’s important to note that of the total U.S. activities associated with the war in Ukraine, and a small portion has supported other affected countries in the region.

The Ukrainian government has received most, but not all, of the funding in the five U.S. supplemental appropriations bills passed since the invasion.

A large share of the money in the aid bills has been spent in the United States, paying for American factories and workers to produce the various weapons that are either shipped to Ukraine or that replenish the U.S. aid has gone toward providing weapons systems, training, and intelligence that Ukrainian commanders need to defend against Russia, which has one of the [world’s most powerful militaries](https://www.cfr.org/in-brief/how-do-militaries-russia-and-ukraine-stack "world’s most powerful militaries")
. Many Western analysts say the military aid provided by the United States and other allies has played a pivotal role in Ukraine’s defense and counteroffensive against Russia. After some initial restrictions, the Biden administration in November permitted Ukraine’s first use of the ATACMS to strike inside Russian territory.

 

How does the aid to Ukraine compare to that for other recipients of U.S. contribution stands out, particularly in the case of military aid.

However, many European governments are making larger contributions to Ukraine relative to the size of their economies.

Thirty countries made major arms transfers to Ukraine in the first two years of the war. The vast majority of committed aid has been allocated, but much of it has not yet been delivered.

**Q3: What has been the history of aid flow under the Trump administration?**

**A3:** The table below lays out the Trump administration’s actions since taking office in January.

**Q4: What aid did the DOD pause on July 1, and why?**

Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/2/ukraine-says-defence-sector-corruption-scheme-uncovered](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/2/ukraine-says-defence-sector-corruption-scheme-uncovered)) reported that Ukrainian authorities detained officials over a "large-scale corruption scheme" in the defense sector involving inflated prices for military drones and signal jamming systems, with kickbacks up to 30 percent of contract amounts <image:k>. Politico ([https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-uncovers-major-corruption-scheme-defense-procurment-days-after-restoring-anticorruption/](https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-uncovers-major-corruption-scheme-defense-procurment-days-after-restoring-anticorruption/)) also reported on a corruption scheme involving the procurement of military equipment at inflated prices, with participants receiving 30 percent of the contract amount.

PBS Frontline World ([https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/sierraleone/context.html](https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/sierraleone/context.html)) discusses illicit weapons, high-level corruption, and organized crime centered in Ukraine, which inherited huge stockpiles of arms after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The article states that Ukraine lost $32 billion in military assets between 1992 and 1998, in part through theft, discount arms sales, and lack of oversight.


### Evidence from `web_search`
Al Jazeera published an article on August 21, 2025, discussing US aid to Ukraine, which totaled 114.64 billion euros ($134bn) between January 24, 2022, and June 30, 2025. The aid includes military, financial, and humanitarian aid, as well as various weapons systems from allies. ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/21/tracking-us-and-nato-support-for-ukraine-a-full-breakdown](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/21/tracking-us-and-nato-support-for-ukraine-a-full-breakdown)) <image:1>, <image:2>

Forumarmstrade.org lists military aid packages to Ukraine from various countries, including the United States, Germany, France, and others. The aid includes artillery shells, ammunition, air defense systems, drones, and other military equipment. The document does not mention Ukraine selling armaments. The Kiel Institute for the World Economy provides a "Ukraine Support Tracker" database quantifying military, financial, and humanitarian aid pledged to Ukraine since January 24, 2022.

## Elaboration
The evidence reveals instances of corruption within Ukraine's defense sector, including inflated prices and kickbacks on procurement contracts. There is also evidence of past illicit arms sales and theft of military assets. However, the provided sources do not directly support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States.

The Al Jazeera article ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/21/tracking-us-and-nato-support-for-ukraine-a-full-breakdown](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/21/tracking-us-and-nato-support-for-ukraine-a-full-breakdown)) details the substantial US aid to Ukraine, but it does not mention any arms sales by Ukraine. The Kiel Institute for the World Economy's "Ukraine Support Tracker" ([https://www.ifw-kiel.de/topics/war-against-ukraine/ukraine-support-tracker/](https://www.ifw-kiel.de/topics/war-against-ukraine/ukraine-support-tracker/)) quantifies aid but does not address the claim.

To verify the claim, information is needed on the volume of arms received from the US, the volume of arms sold by Ukraine, and evidence linking the two.

The European Union Advisory Mission Ukraine (EUAM) ([https://www.euam-ukraine.eu/news/moia-launches-the-coordination-centre-to-combat-illicit-arms-trafficking/](https://www.euam-ukraine.eu/news/moia-launches-the-coordination-centre-to-combat-illicit-arms-trafficking/)) reported on the launch of a Coordination Centre to Combat Illicit Arms Trafficking by the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine <image:13559>, <image:13561>, <image:13562>, <image:13564>.

## Elaboration
The new evidence continues to highlight concerns about arms trafficking and corruption within Ukraine's defense sector. However, it still does not provide any direct evidence to support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. The sources discuss the potential for arms trafficking and efforts to combat it, but they do not confirm the claim.

To verify the claim, specific data on the volume of arms received from the US, the volume of arms sold by Ukraine, and evidence linking the two is still needed.

To verify the claim, information is needed on the volume of arms received from the US, the volume of arms sold by Ukraine, and evidence linking the two.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime ([https://globalinitiative.net/analysis/future-trends-in-arms-trafficking-from-the-ukraine-conflict/](https://globalinitiative.net/analysis/future-trends-in-arms-trafficking-from-the-ukraine-conflict/)) discusses the potential for increased arms trafficking from Ukraine, but does not mention Ukraine selling armaments. The European Union Advisory Mission Ukraine (EUAM) ([https://www.euam-ukraine.eu/news/moia-launches-the-coordination-centre-to-combat-illicit-arms-trafficking/](https://www.euam-ukraine.eu/news/moia-launches-the-coordination-centre-to-combat-illicit-arms-trafficking/)) reported on the launch of a Coordination Centre to Combat Illicit Arms Trafficking by the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine <image:13559>, <image:13561>, <image:13562>, <image:13564>. The UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) ([https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/07/1165428](https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/07/1165428)) reported on the rise of arms seizures and violence in Ukraine, but does not mention Ukraine selling armaments received from the US.


## Elaboration
The new evidence continues to highlight concerns about arms trafficking and corruption within Ukraine's defense sector. However, it still does not provide any direct evidence to support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. The sources discuss the potential for arms trafficking and efforts to combat it, but they do not confirm the claim.

To verify the claim, specific data on the volume of arms received from the US, the volume of arms sold by Ukraine, and evidence linking the two is still needed.


## Actions
```
web_search("Ukraine arms sales US aid statistics")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Council on Foreign Relations ([https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-us-aid-going-ukraine](https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-us-aid-going-ukraine)) states that Ukraine is the top recipient of U.S. aid, which includes weapons systems, training, and intelligence. The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) provides data on military aid to Ukraine, including announcements and deliveries of weapons ([https://www.csis.org/analysis/trump-sends-weapons-ukraine-numbers](https://www.csis.org/analysis/trump-sends-weapons-ukraine-numbers)) <image:13576>, <image:13577>. The U.S. State Department approved a Foreign Military Sale to Ukraine for Air Delivered Munitions, estimated at $825 million ([https://www.dsca.mil/Press-Media/Major-Arms-Sales/Article-Display/Article/4289280/ukraine-air-delivered-munitions](https://www.dsca.mil/Press-Media/Major-Arms-Sales/Article-Display/Article/4289280/ukraine-air-delivered-munitions)). None of these sources mention Ukraine selling armaments.


## Elaboration
The evidence consistently shows that Ukraine is a major recipient of U.S. military aid, including weapons systems. However, none of the provided sources support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. While there are reports of corruption and arms trafficking concerns, there is no direct evidence to substantiate the claim.

**Verdict:** The claim is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The investigation revealed that Ukraine receives significant military aid from the United States, and there are documented instances of corruption and concerns about arms trafficking within Ukraine. However, the search results do not provide any evidence to support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States.

`false`


## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The investigation found no evidence to support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. While Ukraine is a major recipient of U.S. military aid, and there are documented concerns about corruption and arms trafficking, the provided sources, including those from Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/21/tracking-us-and-nato-support-for-ukraine-a-full-breakdown](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/21/tracking-us-and-nato-support-for-ukraine-a-full-breakdown)) and the Council on Foreign Relations ([https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-us-aid-going-ukraine](https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-us-aid-going-ukraine)), do not mention or confirm any such sales.

A video claiming that USAID, the US government's main overseas aid agency, has paid Hollywood celebrities millions of dollars to visit Ukraine has gone viral on social media and has been amplified by high-profile accounts like Elon Musk.

However, the clip is not real and has hallmarks of a Russian disinformation operation that the BBC has previously investigated.

BBC Verify's Olga Robinson explains why.

An online video claiming The United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the U.S. government’s main overseas aid agency, paid some Hollywood stars to visit Ukraine has been debunked by the BBC.

The BBC Verify division [identified the fake video](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0m12wl0jwpo)
 as part of a Russian disinformation campaign, but only after the false content went viral on social media platforms and was [retweeted on X by Elon Musk.](https://x.com/Shayan86/status/1887286413181296965/photo/1)

Stars mentioned in the video to have received payments included Angelina Jolie, Sean Pean, Jean Claude Van Dam, Orlando Bloom and Ben Stiller.

 that “Ben Stiller is not compensated for his work with UNHCR and self-funds his travel. Ben has been supporting UNHCR since 2016 and has been a Goodwill Ambassador since 2018. We are grateful for Ben’s longstanding support to refugees and forcibly displaced people.”

The video from February 5 claims that USAID paid **Angelina Jolie** $20 million, **Sean Penn** $5 million, **Jean-Claude Van Damme** (misspelled in the footage) $1.5 million, **Orlando Bloom** $8 million, and **Ben Stiller** $4 million to complete their respective visits to Ukraine.

 between April and May 2022 while serving as a special envoy for the UN refugee agency. There was no funding from USAID and certainly no payment of any kind.”

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "E! News reported that the United States Agency Aid and Development (USAID) paid millions for celebrities to visit Ukraine."

## Actions
```
web_search("E! News USAID Ukraine celebrities")
web_search("USAID Ukraine celebrity visits")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Several sources debunk a video alleging that USAID paid Hollywood celebrities to visit Ukraine. The BBC ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0m12wl0jwpo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0m12wl0jwpo)) and The Hollywood Reporter ([https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/politics-news/fake-online-usaid-paid-hollywood-stars-debunked-1236129713/](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/politics-news/fake-online-usaid-paid-hollywood-stars-debunked-1236129713/)) identified the video as Russian disinformation. The video falsely claimed USAID paid Angelina Jolie, Sean Penn, Jean Claude Van Damme, Orlando Bloom, and Ben Stiller.

Ben Stiller denied the claims, stating he self-funded his trip, as reported by Vanity Fair ([https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/ben-stiller-denies-elon-musks-retweet-claiming-usaid-funded-the-stars-trip-to-ukraine?srsltid=AfmBOooGw1dpqnug2OYCP6ztL_oyb-nbLtgTwlK9XIbCoPDkIdmO6uAz](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/ben-stiller-denies-elon-musks-retweet-claiming-usaid-funded-the-stars-trip-to-ukraine?srsltid=AfmBOooGw1dpqnug2OYCP6ztL_oyb-nbLtgTwlK9XIbCoPDkIdmO6uAz)). The video was fabricated to appear as though it came from E!.


### Evidence from `web_search`
The Duke Sanford School of Public Policy reported on claims that USAID paid celebrities to travel to Ukraine (<image:k>). The Hollywood Reporter published an article debunking a video that claimed USAID paid Hollywood stars to visit Ukraine. The article was written by Etan Vlessing and published on February 7, 2025. [https://sanford.duke.edu/news/dan-ariely-usaid-didnt-pay-celebrities-travel-ukraine-despite-new-claims/](https://sanford.duke.edu/news/dan-ariely-usaid-didnt-pay-celebrities-travel-ukraine-despite-new-claims/) and [https://www.imdb.com/news/ni65115329/](https://www.imdb.com/news/ni65115329/).


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the claim is false. Multiple sources, including the BBC and The Hollywood Reporter, debunked a video that falsely alleged USAID paid celebrities to visit Ukraine. The video was fabricated to look like it came from E! News. Ben Stiller denied the claims, stating he self-funded his trip.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that the claim is false. Multiple sources, including the BBC and The Hollywood Reporter, debunked a video that falsely alleged USAID paid celebrities to visit Ukraine. The video was fabricated and misrepresented information.

Nearly three years after **Ben Stiller** [called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Axbhf1Qhe94)
 Ukrainian president **Volodymyr Zelenskyy** “my hero” during a humanitarian trip to his country, the actor is refuting claims that his travels were funded by the US Agency for International Development (USAID).

“Totally false. Seeking safety is a right and it needs to be upheld for every person.”

The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) [confirmed on its website](https://www.unhcr.org/us/news/speeches-and-statements/statement-goodwill-ambassador-ben-stillers-work-behalf-unhcr)
 that “Ben Stiller is not compensated for his work with UNHCR and self-funds his travel. Ben has been supporting UNHCR since 2016 and has been a Goodwill Ambassador since 2018. We are grateful for Ben’s longstanding support to refugees and forcibly displaced people.”

The video from February 5 claims that USAID paid **Angelina Jolie** $20 million, **Sean Penn** $5 million, **Jean-Claude Van Damme** (misspelled in the footage) $1.5 million, **Orlando Bloom** $8 million, and **Ben Stiller** $4 million to complete their respective visits to Ukraine.

A post [shared on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=3936628693283593&id=100008095036730)
 claims billionaire Elon Musk posted a “last dollar” for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

**Verdict: False**

There is no evidence that Musk posted this.

**Fact Check:**

Musk joined President-elect Donald Trump on his phone call with Zelenskyy, according to [The Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-ukraine-elon-musk-zelenskyy-starlink-f6ab0c5e1c5de1262ae2a1747247819c)
. Musk has become a part of Trump’s inner circle, the outlet reported.

Social media users are claiming that Musk posted that Zelenskyy had received his “last dollar.” These claims show an image of a purported tweet from Musk, which states, “The last dollar for Zelenskiy” and is accompanied by a dollar with Trump in the middle.

These claims are false. 6 tweet.

> [](https://twitter.com/CforCD/status/1854169532924891301?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

“The tweet attributed to Elon Musk about the alleged ‘last dollar for Zelenskyy’ featuring a bill with Donald Trump’s portrait is fake. This is fabricated content intended for manipulation and provocation,” reads the tweet.

Logically Facts also [debunked](https://www.logicallyfacts.com/en/fact-check/no-elon-musk-didnt-post-the-last-dollar-for-zelenskyy)
 this claim, saying that Ukrainian and Russian Telegram channels spread the fake image, though noted the Ukrainian channels said it was satire.

From [Source](https://www.politico.eu/article/billionaire-elon-musk-mocks-ukraine-president-zelenskyy-asking-aid-with-meme/): 
Content: "[Skip to main content](#main)

Billionaire entrepreneur [Elon Musk mocked Ukraine’s war-time leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1708629197617336398)
 on Monday, using a meme to scoff at the president’s calls for Western aid.

“When it’s been 5 min and you haven’t asked for a billion dollars in aid,” read Musk’s message, which accompanied Zelenskyy’s head attached to a famous photo of an agitated schoolboy, who — according to the [meme’s etymology](https://medium.com/@tazreen.noman/the-origin-of-michael-mcgee-vein-popping-guy-ad41c63190f0)
 — was in a classroom and desperately trying to hold in flatulence.

Musk has had a troubled relationship with Ukrainians and the country’s administration since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion in February 2022, but now they’ve had just about enough of the SpaceX chief and owner of X (formerly Twitter).

“So you have bought social media to bully people who are dying because \[they\] love freedom,” Ukrainian stand-up comedian Anton Tymoshenko [wrote](https://twitter.com/_Tymoshenko/status/1708716338196214196)
 in response to Musk’s post.

“Elon, did you write this meme during a friendly conversation with Putin on the phone?” another Ukrainian comic and volunteer, Vasyl Baydak, [wrote](https://twitter.com/by_by_duck/status/1708711638268878922)
 — alluding to a [New Yorker report](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/08/28/elon-musks-shadow-rule)
 that Musk and the Russian president spoke directly.

Even Ukrainian media organizations joined the anti-Musk revolt, with top publication Ukrainska Pravda [posting](https://twitter.com/pravda_eng/status/1708732658182701406?s=20)
 the same meme, but with Musk’s face photoshopped in, saying: “When’s it’s been 5 minutes and you haven’t spread Russian propaganda.”

Zelenskyy has not yet reacted to Musk’s post. But that narrative flipped after he began spreading what Ukraine said was [pro-Russian propaganda](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/03/ukrainian-officials-and-allies-rail-against-elon-musk-tweet-00060085)
 via his social media.

According to a new biography of the tech boss, Musk also secretly ordered his engineers to [disable Starlink satellite](https://www.politico.eu/article/elon-musk-ukraine-starlink-russia-crimea-war-drone-submarine-attack-sabotage/)
 communications near the coast of Russian-occupied Crimea last year to sabotage a planned Ukrainian drone strike.

Last week, the [European Commission slammed Musk’s X](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_NCu44_Xc0)
 as the social media platform which is the biggest source of disinformation. President Joe Biden [signed](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/09/30/biden-administration-congress-government-shutdown-deal-ukraine-aid-00119296)
 a temporary budget bill featuring no Ukraine aid to avert the American government’s shutdown.

Shortly after Putin’s assault on Kyiv began last year, Musk was hailed in Ukraine thanks to his early decision to provide Starlink satellite internet for the country. But one of his office advisers, Serhiy Leshchenko, hit back [in a tweet](https://twitter.com/Leshchenkos/status/1708720295681421701)
 accusing Musk of “trolling.”

Musk’s meme comes shortly after U.S."

**_UNITED24_** **did not report such information, and neither did any other credible source.**

Ukraine has found an alternative to the American satellite system Starlink, a number of pro-Russian sources [report](https://archive.ph/JTBdd)
 citing _UNITED24_. At the same time while commenting on this decision communications officer Ruslana Danilkina allegedly spoke obscenely about Elon Musk in the context of his recent comments about Ukraine.

! On her [personal page](https://www.instagram.com/rusya_danilkina/)
, she also did not publish any offensive comments about Elon Musk, and did not comment on this news invented by propagandists.

For now, Ukraine continues to use the Starlink system, despite the tensions in relations with the United States. They had previously used the _UNITED24_ brand identity to spread the fake that [eight villas of Ukrainian generals burned down in Los Angeles.](https://www.stopfake.org/en/fake-eight-villas-belonging-to-ukrainian-generals-burned-down-in-los-angeles/)

And secondly, Ruslana Danilkina, who was called a communications officer in the video, does not actually currently hold combat positions in the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Electronic warfare equipment manufacturer and former Air Force officer Anatoly Khrapchinsky [considers](https://www.unian.ua/war/starlink-hrapchinskiy-poyasniv-chi-maye-ukrajina-alternativu-suputnikovomu-zv-yazku-12932037.html)
 the Starlink shutdown unlikely: _«Both Trump and Musk are about money. That’s why they won’t give up multibillion-dollar, multimillion-dollar contracts."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The AOL article ([https://www.aol.com/fact-check-elon-musk-didn-164103080.html](https://www.aol.com/fact-check-elon-musk-didn-164103080.html)) fact-checks the claim that Elon Musk posted "The last dollar for Zelenskiy" and states the claim is false. The article includes an image of a purported tweet from Musk with the text "The last dollar for Zelenskiy" and a dollar bill with Trump's image <image:2360>. A wider internet search and a review of Musk’s X account did not yield any results for this claim.

The Politico.eu article ([https://www.politico.eu/article/billionaire-elon-musk-mocks-ukraine-president-zelenskyy-asking-aid-with-meme/](https://www.politico.eu/article/billionaire-elon-musk-mocks-ukraine-president-zelenskyy-asking-aid-with-meme/)) discusses Elon Musk's meme mocking Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's calls for Western aid.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the claim is false. The AOL article fact-checks the claim and states that it is not authentic. A wider internet search and a review of Musk's X account did not yield any results for this claim.

Newsweek AI is in beta. The cause of the fire is not known, and it is not clear whether the vehicle had been personally used by Putin, but the Russian leader has reportedly displayed paranoia about assassination plots.

What To Know
------------

The Aurus limousine blew up on Sretenka Street just north of the FSB headquarters in Lubyanka on Saturday night, with video footage showing the fire spreading to the vehicle's interior.

Onlookers can be seen watching back smoke billowing out of the front of the destroyed vehicle, and the rear of the car also seemed to be damaged.

It is not clear who was using the car, but it is said to be owned by Putin's Presidential Property Management Department, British newspaper _The Sun_ reported. The independent Russian language outlet Meduza [said that Putin](https://www.newsweek.com/putin-decries-massive-blunder-after-top-general-assassinated-2003548)
 had called the incident a major security lapse.

Video from Putin's visit last week to the Arctic city of Murmansk showed servicemen from a ceremonial guard being patted down for hidden weapons or explosive devices before the president came to lay a wreath by the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.

What People Are Saying
----------------------

**_The Sun_ newspaper wrote:** "An Aurus limousine from Putin's 'official car fleet' blew up in a huge blast on a street just north of Moscow's FSB secret service headquarters in Lubyanka."

**Ukrainian X user Devana posted:** "Not just Russia is burning—even Putin's limo went boom. So hey, Vladimir—if even your car goes up in flames next to FSB HQ … maybe the system's cracking from within?"

What Happens Next
-----------------

Official comment about the car blast is unlikely, but security around Putin will continue to dominate headlines. [Russia's special services have ramped up](https://www.newsweek.com/putin-spending-personal-security-russia-ukraine-arrest-warrant-icc-1803885)
 the [already-strict security measures](https://www.newsweek.com/putin-bulletproof-vest-armor-public-events-security-1908361)
 surrounding the Russian leader to an unprecedented degree, unnamed Russian and Kremlin officials told _The Moscow Times_ in June 2024.

The video of the alleged explosion has gone viral on social media, leading to speculation of an assassination attempt on the Russian leader
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A £275,000 Aurus Senat limousine, believed to be from Russian President Vladimir Putin's official car fleet, reportedly exploded and caught fire on a street in Moscow near the country's top intelligence agency FSB's headquarters.

 ![A huge volume of smoke was seen flowing out of the vehicle, in which the front portion is also believed to have been damaged in the incident.(HT File)](https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/03/30/550x309/KWHEVD2_1708605928909_1743298840432.jpg "A huge volume of smoke was seen flowing out of the vehicle, in which the front portion is also believed to have been damaged in the incident.(HT File)")

The incident is said to have taken place on March 29 on a street north of Moscow’s FSB headquarters, located near the Lubyanka, according to EuroWeekly.

A purported video of the alleged explosion has gone viral on social media, leading to speculation of an assassination attempt on the Russian leader amid talks backed by the United States to end Moscow's war in Ukraine.

In the viral video, workers from nearby establishments could be seen helping to extinguish the fire, which is believed to have started from the car's engine bay area and spread to its interiors.

### Watch the viral video here

Thick smoke was seen flowing out of the vehicle, whose front portion is also believed to have been damaged in the incident.

It was not immediately clear who was present in the car during the incident, as no injuries were reported, according to The Sun.

It is suspected that the fire started in the car’s engine and quickly engulfed the entire vehicle, EuroWeekly reported.

### **Ukraine war**

Ukrainian government and military analysts speaking to AP expected Russia to launch a fresh offensive across the 1,000-kilometer front line to strengthen its negotiating position ahead of potential talks with Kyiv.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia is getting ready for new offensives in the northeastern regions.

Putin escapes assassination bid? stuck in endless and pointless discussions about fake ‘conditions’ just to buy time and then try to grab more land,” Zelenskyy said Thursday in a visit to Paris.

The two sides have stepped up their aerial attacks even as US President Donald Trump pushes them to agree to a ceasefire after more than three years of intense fighting.

Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of breaching commitments to not strike energy facilities.

Zelensky also rejected Putin's idea of a “transitional administration”, backed by the United Nations, in Ukraine and said it was Putin's latest ploy to delay a peace deal.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that there have been reports of incidents involving Vladimir Putin's limousines, including a fire and an explosion. However, none of the provided sources confirm that Putin died in an explosion. The reports mention speculation about assassination attempts and rumors about Putin's health, but they do not confirm the claim.

The claim cannot be verified with the available information. The evidence only confirms that there were incidents involving Putin's limousines, but not his death.

To verify the claim, information about Putin's death would be needed.

Vladimir Putin in August 2025

Speculations regarding the health of [Vladimir Putin](/wiki/Vladimir_Putin "Vladimir Putin")
 have been a regular occurrence since his rise to power. This is largely speculation and cannot be accredited for authenticity.

Background
----------

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Claims_of_Vladimir_Putin%27s_incapacity_and_death&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Background")\
\]

Further information: [Public image of Vladimir Putin](/wiki/Public_image_of_Vladimir_Putin "Public image of Vladimir Putin")

For approximately 20 years, multiple sources have regularly reported that the [president of Russia](/wiki/President_of_Russia "President of Russia")
 [Vladimir Putin](/wiki/Vladimir_Putin "Vladimir Putin")
 is weeks or months away from death or medical incapacity.[\[1\]](#cite_note-cepa-1)
 At various points, it has been rumored that he is suffering from terminal [thyroid cancer](/wiki/Thyroid_cancer "Thyroid cancer")
, [blood cancer](/wiki/Blood_cancer "Blood cancer")
, [abdominal cancer](/wiki/Abdominal_cancer "Abdominal cancer")
, [Parkinson's disease](/wiki/Parkinson%27s_disease "Parkinson's disease")
, [leprosy](/wiki/Leprosy "Leprosy")
, serious surgery complications, the aftereffects of a [stroke](/wiki/Stroke "Stroke")
, or that he is, in fact, already dead.[\[2\]](#cite_note-nyt-2)
[\[3\]](#cite_note-ns-3)
[\[1\]](#cite_note-cepa-1)

According to the _[New Statesman](/wiki/New_Statesman "New Statesman")
_, many such allegations are based on "the old Soviet-era practice of [Kremlinology](/wiki/Kremlinology "Kremlinology")
, in which analysts scrutinise the leader's public appearances for signs of physical decline and clues as to who might be in favour or out, in the absence of reliable information".[\[3\]](#cite_note-ns-3)

Selected reports
----------------

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Claims_of_Vladimir_Putin%27s_incapacity_and_death&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Selected reports")\
\]

### 2005 report of stroke

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Claims_of_Vladimir_Putin%27s_incapacity_and_death&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: 2005 report of stroke")\
\]

In 2005, _[The Atlantic](/wiki/The_Atlantic "The Atlantic")
_ published an essay, based on observation of film footage, alleging Putin had suffered a stroke and was dying.[\[1\]](#cite_note-cepa-1)
[\[4\]](#cite_note-4)

### 2014 report of cancer

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Claims_of_Vladimir_Putin%27s_incapacity_and_death&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: 2014 report of cancer")\
\]

It was reported according to an unnamed German doctor, that Putin was receiving treatment for an "often terminal form of cancer".[\[5\]](#cite_note-ind-5)
 Russian government spokesman Dmitri Peskov denied the claim.[\[5\]](#cite_note-ind-5)

### 2015 report of cosmetic surgery complications

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Claims_of_Vladimir_Putin%27s_incapacity_and_death&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: 2015 report of cosmetic surgery complications")\
\]

Mainstream media outlets in the United States reported that Vladimir Putin might be seriously ill due to complications from a secret cosmetic surgery procedure it was claimed he'd undergone.[\[6\]](#cite_note-vox-6)
 The rumors originated after the Russian president postponed a scheduled meeting from 11 to 18 March, as well as analysis of background objects in official photographs by Russia observers.[\[6\]](#cite_note-vox-6)

_[Vox](/wiki/Vox_(website) "Vox (website)")
_ reported that "the idea that Putin would schedule plastic surgery for a week when he was supposed to have multiple public meetings seems highly implausible" and Russian government spokesman Dmitri Peskov denied Putin was suffering any type of medical issues.[\[6\]](#cite_note-vox-6)
 Asked to comment on the report Putin was dying of surgery complications, the Brookings Institution's Hannah Thoburn said "for all we know, he probably has the flu, or just wanted to hang out with his daughters or something".[\[6\]](#cite_note-vox-6)
 Russian television later aired footage of Putin attending a separate meeting on 13 March.[\[6\]](#cite_note-vox-6)

### 2017 and 2020 reports of leprosy and Parkinson's disease

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Claims_of_Vladimir_Putin%27s_incapacity_and_death&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: 2017 and 2020 reports of leprosy and Parkinson's disease")\
\]

In 2017, Russian historian and political analyst [Valery Solovei](/wiki/Valery_Solovei "Valery Solovei")
 asserted Vladimir Putin was about to resign for health-related reasons.[\[1\]](#cite_note-cepa-1)
 Putin did not resign.[\[1\]](#cite_note-cepa-1)
 In 2020, Solovei and others variously claimed that Putin had cancer, [Parkinson's disease](/wiki/Parkinson%27s_disease "Parkinson's disease")
 or [leprosy](/wiki/Leprosy "Leprosy")
 and would imminently resign, a claim which also did not transpire.[\[1\]](#cite_note-cepa-1)

### 2022 reports of multiple illnesses

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Claims_of_Vladimir_Putin%27s_incapacity_and_death&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: 2022 reports of multiple illnesses")\
\]

Following the 2022 [Russian invasion of Ukraine](/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine "Russian invasion of Ukraine")
, according to _[The New York Times](/wiki/The_New_York_Times "The New York Times")
_, rumors of Putin being seriously ill became "a subject of lurid speculation, internet video forensics, and potential wartime propaganda, even though U.S. officials say there is no evidence the Russian leader is dying".[\[7\]](#cite_note-7)

In May 2022, Ukrainian military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov reported that Vladimir Putin was simultaneously suffering from "several serious illnesses, one of which is cancer".[\[8\]](#cite_note-graun-8)
 [Christopher Steele](/wiki/Christopher_Steele "Christopher Steele")
 also alleged Putin was "dying".[\[1\]](#cite_note-cepa-1)

The _[New Statesman](/wiki/New_Statesman "New Statesman")
_ reported there was "no verifiable evidence that Putin is seriously ill"; Russian foreign minister [Sergei Lavrov](/wiki/Sergei_Lavrov "Sergei Lavrov")
 denied the allegation; William Burns, the director of the United States [Central Intelligence Agency](/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency "Central Intelligence Agency")
 said "as far as we can tell, he's entirely too healthy"; and [Richard Moore](/wiki/Richard_Moore_(diplomat) "Richard Moore (diplomat)")
, the head of [MI6](/wiki/MI6 "MI6")
 said there "is no evidence that Putin is suffering from serious illness".[\[2\]](#cite_note-nyt-2)
 [\[8\]](#cite_note-graun-8)
[\[9\]](#cite_note-9)
[\[3\]](#cite_note-ns-3)

On 28 May 2022 the _[Daily Star](/wiki/Daily_Star_(United_Kingdom) "Daily Star (United Kingdom)")
_ even speculated that Putin might have already died of blood cancer.[\[3\]](#cite_note-ns-3)
 The _[Sunday Mirror](/wiki/Sunday_Mirror "Sunday Mirror")
_ published its own story the next day also reporting that Putin may have been dead.[\[3\]](#cite_note-ns-3)

In July 2022, the _[Toronto Sun](/wiki/Toronto_Sun "Toronto Sun")
_ and other media outlets reported Putin had lost use of his right arm due to an unexplained medical crisis. The _Toronto Sun_ cited, as evidence of the allegation, that a video showed Putin swatting a [mosquito](/wiki/Mosquito "Mosquito")
 with his left arm instead of his right.[\[10\]](#cite_note-ts-10)

Neurologists have previously noted that several Russian officials such as [Anatoly Sidorov](/wiki/Anatoly_Sidorov "Anatoly Sidorov")
 and [Sergei Ivanov](/wiki/Sergei_Ivanov "Sergei Ivanov")
 who, like Putin, have specialized training by Soviet-era military and intelligence services and typically make limited use of their right arm, often holding it unnaturally stiff to the side of the torso in what is called [gunslinger's gait](/wiki/Gunslinger%27s_gait "Gunslinger's gait")
.[\[11\]](#cite_note-nbc-11)
 A 2015 study by Dutch physicians published in the _[British Medical Journal](/wiki/British_Medical_Journal "British Medical Journal")
_ which compared video of the various officials against body movement instructions in a [KGB](/wiki/KGB "KGB")
 training manual, suggested this was a learned behavioral adaptation to allow quick access to a firearm in response to a sudden threat and probably not a signifier of any medical condition in either Putin or other Russian political leaders.[\[12\]](#cite_note-12)

In December 2022, Solovei announced Putin was being treated with cancer drugs for an unspecified, advanced stage cancer and "the end is already in sight".[\[13\]](#cite_note-13)
 Several years prior, in 2017, Solovei suggested that Putin might resign due to ill health.[\[1\]](#cite_note-cepa-1)

### January 2023 claim by Zelenskyy

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Claims_of_Vladimir_Putin%27s_incapacity_and_death&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: January 2023 claim by Zelenskyy")\
\]

In January 2023, Ukrainian president [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy "Volodymyr Zelenskyy")
 publicly "questioned whether Vladimir Putin was still alive" during a virtual address to the [World Economic Forum](/wiki/World_Economic_Forum "World Economic Forum")
 and suggested that Putin might have already been replaced by [his body double](/wiki/Alleged_doubles_of_Vladimir_Putin "Alleged doubles of Vladimir Putin")
.[\[14\]](#cite_note-14)

Speculation about Russian President Vladimir Putin’s health is only surpassed by theories surrounding the nature of his relationship with U.S. 
\[TASS\]

**Ukrainian President** Volodymyr Zelenskyy appeared in Paris on March 27, 2025, and boldly predicted the demise of his avowed enemy, Russian President Vladimir Putin.

“He will die soon, and that’s a fact, and it will come to end,” declared the man whose leadership through one of history’s more improbable military campaigns has been compared to Winston Churchill’s during the Battle of Britain.

Zelenskyy, who has been targeted by Russian assassins since Moscow’s forces invaded Ukraine in February 2022, apparently didn’t expand on the statement. How he expects Putin to die, by poor health or some other means, wasn’t clear. Putin has survived at least a half-dozen assassination attempts and a raft of rumoured health issues spanning more than two decades.

But Zelenskyy’s assertion spawned yet another wave of speculation about the 72-year-old Putin’s welfare after he has spent the last three-plus years directing an unexpectedly taxing war of aggression in Ukraine.

[! The rumours, old and new, have never been proven.

In late 2016, Russian historian and political analyst Valery Solovei said Putin might be forced to step back from his role for health-related reasons. It found this was likely a learned behavioral adaptation to allow quick access to a firearm in response to a sudden threat and probably not a signifier of any medical condition in either Putin or other high-profile Russians.

> Neurologists have noted that several Russian officials typically make limited use of their right arm, often holding it in what is called gunslinger’s gait.

**In 2022**, the General Svr Telegram channel reported that Putin had soiled himself after falling down stairs, and blamed it on “cancer affecting his stomach and bowels.” Other reports point to his “increasingly erratic behaviour,” and there has been speculation about his mental health.

_The New Statesman_ says many such allegations are based on “rumours swirling within the intelligence community and the old Soviet-era practice of Kremlinology, in which analysts scrutinise the leader’s public appearances for signs of physical decline and clues as to who might be in favour or out, in the absence of reliable information.”

“To be clear,” the news magazine’s Katie Stallard added in a piece first published June 2, 2022, “there is no verifiable evidence that Putin is seriously ill. Still less so that he is dead.”  
> _—Katie Stallard,_ The New Statesman

**_The New York Times_** has said Putin’s health became a particular “subject of lurid speculation, internet video forensics, and potential wartime propaganda” since the invasion of Ukraine, “even though U.S. officials say there is no evidence the Russian leader is dying.”

William Burns said during his 2021-25 tenure as CIA director that “as far as we can tell, he’s entirely too healthy.” Richard Moore, head of Britain’s MI6, said there is “no evidence that Putin is suffering from serious illness.”

Regardless, evidence that Putin has resorted to body doubles, ostensibly as a defence against potential assassination attempts, is relatively strong. <image:5239>](https://legionmagazine.com/long-standing-rumours-of-putins-impending-death-have-been-greatly-exaggerated/pu1/)

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence reveals ongoing speculation and rumors about Vladimir Putin's health and potential death. However, these are unconfirmed. While there are reports of incidents involving Putin's limousines, there is no evidence to support the claim that Putin died in an explosion. The statement by Zelensky is a prediction, not a confirmation.

The claim remains unverified.

The Economic Times reported that one of Vladimir Putin's official limousines exploded in Moscow, raising security concerns (<image:5206>, <image:5207>, <image:5208>).

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that there have been reports of incidents involving Vladimir Putin's limousines, including a fire and an explosion. However, none of the provided sources confirm that Putin died in an explosion. The reports mention speculation about assassination attempts and rumors about Putin's health, but they do not confirm the claim.

The claim cannot be verified with the available information. The evidence only confirms that there were incidents involving Putin's limousines, but not his death.

To verify the claim, information about Putin's death would be needed.


## Actions
```

```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Wikipedia article "Claims of Vladimir Putin's incapacity and death" discusses speculations about Vladimir Putin's health, including claims of various illnesses and even death, which have been circulating for approximately 20 years. The Legion Magazine discusses rumors about Vladimir Putin's health and impending death, mentioning speculation and claims from various sources, but emphasizes that these rumors have not been proven (<image:5235>, <image:5239>). The Economic Times reports that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that Vladimir Putin "will die soon" (<image:5253>, <image:5254>, <image:5255>).

## Elaboration
The evidence reveals ongoing speculation and rumors about Vladimir Putin's health and potential death. However, these are unconfirmed. While there are reports of incidents involving Putin's limousines, there is no evidence to support the claim that Putin died in an explosion. The statement by Zelensky is a prediction, not a confirmation.

The claim remains unverified.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that there have been reports of incidents involving Vladimir Putin's limousines, including a fire and an explosion. However, none of the provided sources confirm that Putin died in an explosion. The reports mention speculation about assassination attempts and rumors about Putin's health, but they do not confirm the claim.

The claim cannot be verified with the available information. The evidence only confirms that there were incidents involving Putin's limousines, but not his death.

To verify the claim, information about Putin's death would be needed.

Putin breaks silence over Prigozhin's reported death

Watch: Putin's first words on Prigozhin plane crash

**Vladimir Putin has broken his silence over Yevgeny Prigozhin's reported death - some 24 hours after the Wagner chief's private jet crashed.**

Russia's president said the head of the mercenary group was a "talented person" who "made serious mistakes in life".

Mr Putin also sent condolences to the families of all 10 people said to be on board the plane that went down north-west of Moscow on Wednesday evening.

However, he stopped short of explicitly confirming Prigozhin's death.

From the moment the plane came down, there has been frenzied speculation about what caused the deadly crash and whether Prigozhin was indeed on board, as stated on the passenger list.

At a briefing on Thursday, a Pentagon spokesperson said the US believed the Wagner chief was likely killed in the crash.

Villagers near the crash site in the Tver region say they heard a loud bang before seeing a plane falling out of the sky.

One of the theories being investigated is whether a bomb was smuggled on board, reports in Russian media suggest.

A US official told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that the most likely cause appeared to be an explosion aboard the aircraft.

What caused the explosion was not known, although a bomb was one possibility, the official added.

Another theory, raised by a Prigozhin-linked Telegram channel, suggested that the jet had been shot down by Russian anti-aircraft forces. <image:13610>!Presentational grey line 3 <image:13611>

When Prigozhin and his armed men - including many convicts - launched their insurrection two months ago, Mr Putin described their actions as "treachery" and a "stab in the back of Russia".

He vowed to punish the perpetrators, who called off their march on Moscow only about 200km (125 miles) from the capital.

However a deal was later reached that saw Wagner fighters given a choice - either join the Russian army or move to neighbouring Belarus, and you will face no punishment.

The rollback surprised both ordinary Russians and experts, who were puzzled that the Wagner boss was apparently being allowed to travel freely across Russia and, it seemed, internationally.

The Russian defence ministry has not commented.

Russian forensic experts are now reported to have started the victims' identification, but Mr Putin said DNA tests would take time.

According to Russia's civil aviation authority, Wagner co-founder Dmitry Utkin and the man who looked after Wagner's finances, Valeriy Chekalov were also on the plane.

All seven passengers and three crew members on board the plane are believed to have died.

* * * But he achieved results both for himself, and for the common good when I asked for it - like in the last few months."

Despite speaking about Prigozhin in the past tense and offering his sympathy to the families of the victims, Mr Putin did not confirm the Wagner chief's death.

! This has not been confirmed, and on Thursday the Pentagon said there was no information to indicate this.

Ground staff in Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport - where the plane took off heading for St Petersburg - are being questioned, and CCTV footage is being checked.

Prigozhin - the leader of Russia's Wagner mercenary group - was once known as a Putin loyalist.

But after leading a short-lived mutiny in Russia in June, many observers described him as a "dead man walking".

The Kremlin stayed conspicuously silent after the crash. The following morning, President Putin even addressed the Brics summit in South Africa via video-link - but made no mention of the crash that much of the world was talking about.

On Thursday evening, however, that changed.

"I would like to above all express words of the most sincere condolences to the families of all those who have died," he said in a televised meeting at his Kremlin residence.

Initial data, he continued, suggested that "Wagner employees" were on board.

"These are people who have made a significant contribution to our common cause of fighting the neo-Nazi regime in Ukraine," Mr Putin said, repeating the Kremlin's false narrative that Ukraine is aligned with Nazism.

He used this accusation to justify his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

Turning to Prigozhin himself, Mr Putin said he had known him since the early 90s, and described him as a "man with a complicated life".

The Russian leader also had praise for Prigozhin and his fighters, in particular for their actions in Ukraine.

Your task is to **summarize the fact-check**. That is, you provide a concise, one-paragraph justification for the final VERDICT based on the knowledge from the Record. Note:
* Be truthful, brief, do not add any additional information besides the information given in the Record. 
* Link key sources in your summary. Use Markdown notation for that. You may link them in-line.
* Don't state the Claim again. Rather focus on the key insights of the fact-check.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "Russian President Vladimir Putin has died in an explosion in one of his limousines."

## Actions
```
web_search("Vladimir Putin death limousine explosion")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Newsweek reports that a limousine from Vladimir Putin's presidential fleet caught fire near the FSB headquarters in Moscow (<image:5183>). The cause of the fire is unknown, and there were no reports of injuries. The Hindustan Times published an article about a viral video of an explosion involving a limousine, believed to be part of Vladimir Putin's official car fleet, in Moscow (<image:k>). The Economic Times reported that one of Vladimir Putin's official limousines exploded in Moscow, raising security concerns (<image:5206>, <image:5207>, <image:5208>).

The articles mention speculation of an assassination attempt and rumors surrounding Putin’s health.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that there have been reports of incidents involving Vladimir Putin's limousines, including a fire and an explosion. However, none of the provided sources confirm that Putin died in an explosion. The reports mention speculation about assassination attempts and rumors about Putin's health, but they do not confirm the claim.

The claim cannot be verified with the available information. The evidence only confirms that there were incidents involving Putin's limousines, but not his death.

To verify the claim, information about Putin's death would be needed.


## Actions
```
web_search("Vladimir Putin health status")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Wikipedia article "Claims of Vladimir Putin's incapacity and death" discusses speculations about Vladimir Putin's health, including claims of various illnesses and even death, which have been circulating for approximately 20 years. The Legion Magazine discusses rumors about Vladimir Putin's health and impending death, mentioning speculation and claims from various sources, but emphasizes that these rumors have not been proven (<image:5235>, <image:5239>). The Economic Times reports that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that Vladimir Putin "will die soon" (<image:5253>, <image:5254>, <image:5255>).

## Elaboration
The evidence reveals ongoing speculation and rumors about Vladimir Putin's health and potential death. However, these are unconfirmed. While there are reports of incidents involving Putin's limousines, there is no evidence to support the claim that Putin died in an explosion. The statement by Zelensky is a prediction, not a confirmation.

The claim remains unverified.


## Actions
```
web_search("Vladimir Putin official statements death")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The official website of the President of Russia, kremlin.ru, shows that Vladimir Putin was active in late August 2025, with meetings and greetings. The BBC reported on August 24, 2023, that Putin commented on the reported death of Yevgeny Prigozhin, but did not explicitly confirm Prigozhin's death. (<image:k>)


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Vladimir Putin was active in late August 2023, which contradicts the claim that he died in an explosion. The official website of the President of Russia shows his activity, and the BBC reported on his comments on another death.

The claim is false.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals reports of incidents involving Vladimir Putin's limousines, as well as ongoing speculation about his health and potential death. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that Putin died in an explosion. Furthermore, official sources show Putin was active in late August 2023. Therefore, the claim is demonstrably false. `false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim that Vladimir Putin died in an explosion is demonstrably false. While there have been reports of incidents involving Putin's limousines and speculation about his health, there is no evidence to support the claim. Furthermore, official sources, such as the [Kremlin website](https://kremlin.ru/), show Putin was active in late August 2023, contradicting the claim.

FSWC Calls for Canadians to Stand with Israel
---------------------------------------------

### News Release

[< Back to News Room](/news)

! <image:1348>

‍

**Statement from FSWC**

**Toronto (October 7, 2023)** - Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center (FSWC) is devastated by today’s horrific news from Israel concerning the many Israelis killed or wounded in the murderous, multi-front assault by Hamas terrorists.

We extend our condolences and deepest sympathies to the families of those killed in this abhorrent, unprovoked attack on civilians. We express our wishes for a full and speedy recovery to those wounded and pray for the safe return of all those kidnapped and taken to Gaza as hostages by the Hamas invaders.

We condemn, in the harshest terms, the actions of Palestinian terror groups in firing thousands of rockets indiscriminately at civilian targets in Israel and massacring residents in numerous villages and towns, actions that constitute heinous war crimes that shouldn’t go unpunished.

FSWC thanks senior police officials in Toronto, York and Peel regions after they informed us that they have devoted additional resources to ensure the safety and security of Jewish residents and Jewish community institutions given the antisemitic attacks that took place two years ago in Toronto during the last major conflict between Israel and Palestinian terror groups in Gaza.

**FSWC President and CEO Michael Levitt issued the following statement:**

“We appreciate the strong support for Israel already expressed by leaders in our country, including the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and many others at all levels of government and many community organizations. We call on all Canadians to stand in solidarity with Israel, to unequivocally condemn today’s appalling attacks against Israelis and to speak out against the actions of the Palestinian terrorists and those who support them, including their backers in Iran.”

On December 28, 2024, Yahya Sare’e, the spokesperson for the Houthis, [announced](https://x.com/AmeenHa2024yan/status/1873057956704731540)
 that a Houthi surface-to-air missile shot down a US MQ-9 Reaper unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) overflying the Al Bayda governorate in Yemen. Despite their protracted deployment, the number of US drones lost to hostile fire was minimal, with only three MQ-9 Reapers shot down by the Houthis between [2017](https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/aviation/news/a28469/us-reaper-drone-shot-down-over-yemen/)
 and [2019](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security-usa-drone-idUSKCN1VB180/)
.

During the Houthis’ anti-shipping campaign, there has been a marked escalation in the group’s tactical proficiency against US drones. Four days later, the Houthis [boasted](https://x.com/AmeenHa2024yan/status/1874346837530087576)
 the downing of a second US-made drone in the Marib governorate, marking the first Houthi strike of an MQ-9 Reaper in 2025.

These attacks represent the latest in a long string of successful Houthi strikes against US UAVs since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war, showcasing the Houthis’ growing offensive capabilities. 

For the Yemeni militant group, imposing a heavy toll on the US drone fleet serves tactical, strategic, and symbolic goals at the domestic and regional levels. The strikes against MQ-9 Reaper drones impair US intelligence and targeting systems and help the Houthis shore up domestic and regional support. And, with the Houthis’ ties to China, Russia, and Iran, downed MQ-9 Reaper drones could end up in the hands of US adversaries. 

Given the benefits the Houthis continue to enjoy from shooting down these drones, the United States needs to adjust its drone deployment strategy to ensure that MQ-9 Reapers are less vulnerable to the militant group’s attacks. 

#### **The offensive**

The surge of attacks on US UAVs and the anti-shipping campaign are major pieces of the Houthi’s latest offensive. Since November 2023, the Houthis [have claimed](https://english.almasirah.net.ye/post/44879/)
 responsibility for downing fourteen MQ-9 Reaper drones, in a series of attacks that have targeted US assets primarily in Marib and Sa’ada governorates. However, those designs are either variants of Iranian weapon systems or based on Iran’s technology, such as the Sayyad-2C (Hunter) missile, the Saqr series (Iran’s 358 missile), and the Barq missile family (Iran’s Taer series). 

#### **Inside the Houthis’ strategy**

Tactically, the Houthi shootdowns of MQ-9 drones primarily aim to blind the US intelligence and targeting systems. The Houthis’ efforts to conceal strategic sites have heightened the Western coalition’s dependence on UAVs to collect actionable intelligence on military installations.

For the Houthis, the shootdowns of US drones also hold symbolic value. Factual or not, these claims serve to inflate the Houthis’ perceived combat strength and burnish their image as a militia capable of confronting US forces head-on.

#### **The Houthis’ dangerous partners**

Although the MQ-9 Reapers have been shot down over Yemen, the negative ramifications of these Houthi attacks on US military assets could spill over beyond the country’s borders. In addition, US intelligence revealed that [Iran mediated talks](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-brokering-talks-send-advanced-russian-missiles-yemens-houthis-sources-say-2024-09-24/)
between Russia and the Houthis that led to Moscow supplying Russian-made advanced anti-ship cruise missiles to the group. For instance, in mid-2019, Iran [rushed](https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5529508,00.html)
 to retrieve a US Navy MQ-4C Triton that the IRGC [shot down](https://www.reuters.com/article/markets/commodities/iran-shoots-down-us-military-drone-in-gulf-region-idUSL8N23R09Y/)
 over the Strait of Hormuz."

From November 2023 until this January, the Houthis targeted more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two of them and killing four sailors. **Osamah Abdulrahman/AP** ****hide caption****

WASHINGTON — Houthi rebels in Yemen have shot down seven U.S. The drones were doing attack runs or conducting surveillance, and they crashed both into the water and onto land, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military operations.

The U.S. He promised to use "overwhelming lethal force" until the Houthis cease their attacks on shipping along a vital maritime corridor.

Central Command spokesman Dave Eastburn said Thursday night that the U.S. "These strikes have destroyed multiple command-and-control facilities, air defense systems, advanced weapons manufacturing facilities, advanced weapons storage locations, and killed hundreds of Houthi fighters and numerous Houthi leaders," Eastburn said.

Another defense official said that although hostile fire is likely the cause of the drone losses, the incidents are still under investigation."

CNN  — 

In the month since the US launched a major military campaign targeting the [Houthi rebel group in Yemen](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/06/middleeast/us-airstrikes-yemen-houthis-may-be-relishing-them-intl/index.html)
, the militants have successfully shot down at least seven multi-million-dollar American drones, hindering the US’ ability to move into “phase two” of the operation, multiple US officials familiar with the matter told CNN.

The US was hoping to achieve air superiority over Yemen within 30 days, officials said and degrade Houthi air defense systems enough to begin a new phase focusing on ramping up intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance of senior Houthi leaders in order to target and kill them, the officials said.

But the platforms best suited to conduct that persistent effort, the MQ9 Reaper drones, keep getting shot down, the officials explained. These assessments were largely based on signals intelligence, one of the people said.

Asked for comment about the downed drones and whether it has negatively impacted the operation, a defense official told CNN in a statement that “we are aware of the Houthi reports these MQ-9s have been shot down. The strikes have forced the Houthis to stay underground more and left them in a “confused and disarrayed state,” the officials noted.

But the consistent loss of the drones has made it more difficult for the US to determine precisely how much the US has degraded the Houthis’ weapons stockpiles.

Over the last six weeks, the Houthis have launched 77 one-way attack drones, 30 cruise missiles, 24 medium-range ballistic missiles, and 23 surface-to-air missiles either at US forces, into the Red Sea, or at Israel, two of the officials said.

The intelligence community has also assessed in recent days that over nearly six weeks of US bombing, the Houthis’ ability and intent to keep lobbing missiles at US and commercial vessels in the Red Sea and at Israel is little changed, as is their command-and-control structure, according to two other people familiar with the intelligence. Trump posted on X in March that the Houthis “have been decimated” and their capabilities “are rapidly being destroyed.”

While Eastburn provided additional data on Thursday regarding the impact of US strikes, US Central Command has been largely silent about the impact, however, even as it routinely shares photos and videos on its X account of missiles firing off of warships or US aircraft preparing to launch off aircraft carriers in the Red Sea. The US does not have boots on the ground in Yemen, so it relies on overhead surveillance — much of it from the MQ9s—to conduct battlefield damage assessments and track terrorists.

CNN [reported earlier this month](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/04/politics/cost-us-military-houthis-limited-impact/index.html)
 that the US had killed several Houthi officials considered to be mid-level, akin to “middle management,” rather than senior political leadership.

The officials said the US had hit over 700 targets and launched more than 300 airstrikes since the campaign began on March 15. “Additionally, Houthi ballistic missile launches have dropped by 87% while attacks from their one-way drones have decreased by 65% since the beginning of these operations.”

The administration is vowing to continue with the campaign until the Houthis can no longer attack Red Sea shipping. In a letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson [last month](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/04/text-of-a-letter-from-the-president-to-the-speaker-of-the-house-of-representatives-and-the-president-pro-tempore-of-the-senate/)
, President Donald Trump said the operations would continue “until the Houthi threat to United States forces and navigational rights and freedoms in the Red Sea and adjacent waters has abated.”

But the Houthis have long proven to be extremely resilient, burying their equipment deep underground and continuing to receive supplies from Iran. The Pentagon has also not addressed claims by the Houthis that the airstrikes have killed dozens of civilians.

In a rare update, CENTCOM said last week that it had destroyed a port in Yemen that the Houthis were using to import oil and fuel their attacks. But the impact of that on the Houthis’ operations similarly remains unclear.

One of the US officials who spoke to CNN left the door open for a continuous campaign in support of US partners in the Gulf region against the Houthis, similar to how the US operates in Africa.

The costs of the campaign, meanwhile, are only rising. The operation [cost the US nearly $1 billion](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/04/politics/cost-us-military-houthis-limited-impact/index.html)
 in just the first three weeks, and the US has continued striking Houthi targets daily for over a month.

The large-scale operation has also rattled some officials at US Indo-Pacific Command, who CNN has reported had complained in recent weeks about the large number of long-range weapons being expended by CENTCOM that would be critical in the event of a war with China.

“We have to maintain a high state of indications and warning so we can get those forces back if there is a crisis with greater exigence than there is one in the CENTCOM (area of responsibility),” US Indo-Pacific Command Commander Adm."

Okay, next job. NATO has carefully studied the conflict even before the Blue Helmets force surge and sent several drones to recon. Two drones were shot down over the coast, now that getting to them has become possible, we can try to pull out the memory block from these. Find their impact locations and bring me the memory disks. Open up the panels to retrieve the disks

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:20> This image shows a US drone which was shot down in March 2025 by the Houthis using Russian missiles."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:20>)
web_search("US drone shot down Houthis Russian missiles")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:20>

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Atlantic Council reports that the Houthis shot down a US MQ-9 Reaper over Yemen on December 28, 2024, and another in the Marib governorate in 2025. The Houthis have claimed responsibility for downing fourteen MQ-9 Reaper drones since November 2023. Iran mediated talks between Russia and the Houthis that led to Moscow supplying Russian-made advanced anti-ship cruise missiles to the group. [Source](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/menasource/houthi-strikes-on-us-mq9-reaper-drones/)

NPR and CNN report that the Houthis shot down seven U.S. Reaper drones in recent weeks. The U.S. launched a major military campaign targeting the Houthi rebel group in Yemen in March 2025. The U.S. has hit over 700 targets and launched more than 300 airstrikes since the campaign began on March 15. [Source](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/25/nx-s1-5377192/houthis-reaper-drones-us-military-yemen), [Source](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/25/politics/houthis-target-drones-hampering-trump-mission) <image:i>


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the Houthis have shot down US MQ-9 Reaper drones. The Atlantic Council reports that the Houthis shot down a US MQ-9 Reaper over Yemen on December 28, 2024, and another in the Marib governorate in 2025. NPR and CNN report that the U.S. launched a major military campaign targeting the Houthi rebel group in Yemen in March 2025.

The claim states that the image shows a US drone shot down in March 2025 by the Houthis using Russian missiles. The evidence does not confirm the image's origin or the specific circumstances of the drone's downing. However, the evidence does support the claim that the Houthis shot down US drones in March 2025.

The evidence does not confirm the image's origin or the specific circumstances of the drone's downing. The claim that the Houthis used Russian missiles is supported by the Atlantic Council, which reports that Iran mediated talks between Russia and the Houthis that led to Moscow supplying Russian-made advanced anti-ship cruise missiles to the group.

A drone crashed into a [New Jersey](https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unidentified-objects-in-new-jersey-skies-trigger-ufo-conspiracy-theories-101734137956906.html)
 homeowner’s backyard after falling out of the sky on Thursday night, December 12. Following the incident, the town’s mayor drove to the scene to survey the site.

The drone crashed in a residential area of Pequannock Township in Morris County around 8:45 pm, as revealed by cops and dispatch audio. Officials said the craft was “a hobby or toy type of drone” and “not a large commercial or military grade drone,” the Pequannock Police Department told New York Post.

This incident comes shortly after New Jersey cops warned of possible “copycats.” “What we think is it started as some sort of Picatinny Arsenal base surveillance drill or operation but once it exploded online, this became a copycat situation,” one Garden State police chief said.

**‘God forbid something happens’**
----------------------------------

After the crash at the resident’s house, the mayor of Pequannock, Ryan Herd, pulled up in a Ford Econoline work van to take a look at the scene. God forbid something happens and it crashes into the big drone, and the big drone crashes into a house and kills six people — that’s going to be a problem,” he said.

The strange drone sightings have alarmed residents and lawmakers alike, with president-elect [Donald Trump](https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-news/who-is-susie-wiles-trump-picks-universally-admired-republican-strategist-as-white-house-chief-of-staff-101731028933780.html)
 suggesting that government officials know more about them than they are disclosing. 5, 2024 (Brian Glenn/TMX via AP, File)(AP)](https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/12/14/550x309/Drone_1734152639153_1734152639365.jpg "This photo provided by Brian Glenn shows what appears to be multiple drones flying over Bernardsville, N.J., on Thursday, Dec. 5, 2024 (Brian Glenn/TMX via AP, File)(AP)")

This photo provided by Brian Glenn shows what appears to be multiple drones flying over Bernardsville, N.J., on Thursday, Dec. Herd said that “it is definitely not” one of the massive, car-size drones, but that he is “absolutely” concerned that “nobody knows whose drones are flying over us and what they’re flying over us for and where they’re taking off and landing.” “Drones are flying over our houses, which is our private property. My family is here,” he added.

The incident is now being investigated by the Morris County Prosecutor’s Office.

Herd has urged residents not to chase after, shoot at or attempt to catch the large drones. “We can’t be putting up Class 1 and Class 2 drones trying to follow these drones."

Drones have reportedly been spotted above Picatinny [Arsenal](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/arsenal)
, a military research and manufacturing facility in Rockaway, and President-elect [Donald Trump](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/donald-trump)
's golf course in Bedminster.

The brightly lit and low-flying drones have been described by eyewitnesses to be significantly larger than those flown by hobbyists, _The New York Times_ reported.

Joseph Orlando, the chief of the Florham Park Police Department in Morris County, said in a statement on Wednesday that drones had been spotted above critical infrastructure, such as water reservoirs, electric transmission lines, police departments and military installations.

"While we currently have no evidence or information to indicate these drones pose an imminent threat at this time, their presence appears nefarious in nature," he wrote.

In response, the Federal Aviation Administration has temporarily banned drones from flying over the military base in Morris County and Trump's golf club.

One family told [Fox News](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/fox-news)
 that while a drone hovered above them, [their car's clock changed time](https://www.newsweek.com/mysterious-new-jersey-drones-change-time-clocks-eyewitness-claims-1996630)

The Atlantic Council reports that the Houthis shot down a US MQ-9 Reaper over Yemen on December 28, 2024, and another in the Marib governorate in 2025. NPR and CNN report that the U.S. launched a major military campaign targeting the Houthi rebel group in Yemen in March 2025.

The claim states that the image shows a US drone shot down in March 2025 by the Houthis using Russian missiles. The evidence does not confirm the image's origin or the specific circumstances of the drone's downing. However, the evidence does support the claim that the Houthis shot down US drones in March 2025.

The evidence does not confirm the image's origin or the specific circumstances of the drone's downing. The claim that the Houthis used Russian missiles is supported by the Atlantic Council, which reports that Iran mediated talks between Russia and the Houthis that led to Moscow supplying Russian-made advanced anti-ship cruise missiles to the group.

Lebanese President Joseph Aoun offered condolences to the soldiers who were killed and injured, stressing that the military “is paying, in blood, the price of preserving stability in the south” of the country.

The deadly incident came as Israel has been carrying out near-daily attacks on Lebanon despite [a ceasefire reached](/news/2024/11/26/ceasefire-between-lebanons-hezbollah-and-israel-what-to-know)
 with Hezbollah in November.

It also coincides with a United Nations Security Council vote to wind down a UN peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon, which has for decades been tasked with maintaining a buffer between Hezbollah fighters and Israeli forces.

The [mandate](/news/2025/8/28/un-security-council-renews-unifil-mission-in-lebanon-until-end-of-2026)
 for the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) was extended through the end of 2026, but after that, the UN will carry out an “orderly and safe drawdown and withdrawal” over the following year.

The resolution aims to make Lebanon’s military “the sole provider of security” in southern Lebanon, a goal complicated by Israel’s continued presence in the country. Both Israel and its top ally, the United States, have been pushing to end the UNIFIL mission.

“The process of withdrawing its 10,800 military and civilian personnel and equipment would start immediately in consultation with the Lebanese government, to be completed within a year,” Al Jazeera’s Zeina Khodr explained.

The US has also been pressuring Lebanon’s government to agree to a plan to disarm Hezbollah – something the Lebanese group has rejected, stressing that such a move will only reward Israel.

On a visit to Beirut on Tuesday, US envoy [Tom Barrack](/news/2025/8/28/us-envoy-says-calling-lebanon-reporters-animalistic-was-inappropriate)
 said Lebanon had agreed to present a plan aimed at persuading Hezbollah to disarm while Israel would submit a corresponding framework for its military withdrawal from the country.

Barrack said the plan, which is expected to be presented on Sunday, will not involve military coercion but focus on efforts to encourage Hezbollah to surrender its weapons.

A day earlier, Hezbollah Secretary-General [Naim Qassem said](/news/2025/8/25/hezbollah-chief-rejects-disarmament-demands-israel-comply-with-ceasefire)
 the Lebanese government must first ensure Israel complies with the ceasefire before talks on a national defence strategy could take place.

“If you truly want sovereignty, then stop the aggression."

In an apparent first, an Israeli Air Force drone was shot down over the Isfahan area in central Iran overnight, the Israeli military and Iranian media said.

Footage broadcast by Iran’s state broadcaster IRIB on Wednesday morning showed what appeared to be a crashed Israeli Air Force Hermes 900.

“During operational activity, a surface-to-air missile was launched at an air force unmanned aerial vehicle,” the Israel Defense Forces said later, confirming the drone crashed in Iran.

The IDF said that “there is no fear of information leaking.”

The IAF has been operating over Iran, at a distance of more than 1,500 kilometers from Israel, since early Friday.

The military says it has air supremacy over western Iran and Tehran, and is working to extend it to other parts of the country, to thwart Iranian ballistic missile attacks on Israel.

More than 70 Iranian air defense batteries have been destroyed in strikes so far, according to the IDF.

> Video of wreckage of an Isralei Hermes drone shot down by the Iranian air defense in the Isfahan province this morning. We are constantly engaged in the struggle to maintain air superiority,” the military said.

The IDF said the incident over Isfahan was being investigated further.

The military has denied previous Iranian claims of shooting down Israeli aircraft, which were not backed by any evidence.

Several Hermes drones were [downed](https://www.timesofisrael.com/hezbollah-downs-idf-drone-over-south-lebanon-fires-heavy-rockets-at-north/)
 during the war with Iran’s proxy Hezbollah terror group.

Now in its sixth day, the Israeli operation in Iran was launched Friday with the objective of removing the “existential threat” of the Iranian nuclear program and ballistic missile capabilities.

Israel says its sweeping assault on Iran’s top military leaders, nuclear scientists, uranium enrichment sites, and ballistic missile program is necessary to prevent the Islamic Republic from realizing its avowed plan to destroy the Jewish state.

Iran has retaliated by launching more than 370 missiles and hundreds of drones at Israel. [Skip to main content](#main-content)

The evidence does not confirm the image's origin or the specific circumstances of the drone's downing. However, the evidence does support the claim that the Houthis shot down US drones in March 2025.

The evidence does not confirm the image's origin or the specific circumstances of the drone's downing. The claim that the Houthis used Russian missiles is supported by the Atlantic Council, which reports that Iran mediated talks between Russia and the Houthis that led to Moscow supplying Russian-made advanced anti-ship cruise missiles to the group.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Escape from Tarkov Wiki discusses a quest involving crashed UAV drones on Shoreline, with images of the crash sites (<image:13615>, <image:13616>, <image:13617>). The Hindustan Times reported on a drone crashing into a New Jersey backyard in December 2024. Newsweek reported on mysterious drone sightings and an alleged crash in New Jersey, with the FBI and local police investigating (<image:13618>).


### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results provide images of drone crash sites. Dronewars.net shows a crashed drone <image:13624>. NBC News shows a drone assessing the Metrojet crash site in Egypt <image:13625>. The Mayor shows a drone crash site in Zagreb, Croatia <image:13626>.


## Elaboration
The evidence provides images of drone crash sites, but none of them match the image in the claim. The evidence does not provide any information about the location of the crash site in the image. Therefore, I cannot verify the claim.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Al Jazeera reports that two Lebanese soldiers were killed while investigating an Israeli drone crash in southern Lebanon on August 28, 2025. The Times of Israel reports that an Israeli Air Force Hermes 900 drone was shot down over the Isfahan area in central Iran on June 18, 2025, and includes an image of the crashed drone. The Jerusalem Post reports that an Iranian Shahed 136 drone crashed into a building in Beit She'an, Israel, on June 21, 2025, and includes an image of the crash site. <image:1>, <image:13627>, <image:21>


### Evidence from `image_search`
Al Jazeera's search result includes an image of a crashed drone <image:13628>. Defense News shows an image of an Israeli F-16I destroyed in an attack <image:13629>.


## Elaboration
The evidence provides images of drone crash sites, including one from the Times of Israel of an Israeli Air Force Hermes 900 drone shot down over Iran on June 18, 2025, and another of an Iranian Shahed 136 drone that crashed in Beit She'an, Israel, on June 21, 2025. However, none of the images match the image in the claim. Therefore, I cannot verify the claim.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image in the claim does not match any of the drone crash sites found in the search results. The claim also states that the drone was shot down by the Houthis, but the evidence does not confirm this. Therefore, the claim is not factually accurate. `false`

US President Donald Trump is focused on peace and has made unprecedented progress in the negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, US Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard told NDTV in an exclusive conversation today.

Here are the top 10 quotes by Tulsi Gabbard:
--------------------------------------------

1. "Trump remains very committed to combating and defeating the threat of Islamist terrorism. "Trump is also taking action where the previous administration failed. So, President Trump has taken a decisive action for our own safety, security, and prosperity."
    

8. "President Trump is seeing this ongoing conflict with very clear eyes. "Under the previous administration, there was no effort at all towards peace or direct dialogue with Putin to bring an end to this war. So, in a very short period of time, Trump has made much more progress towards peace than any other previous effort. The talks are just beginning between Trump's incoming cabinet and the Bangladesh government, but this continues to remain a central focus area of concern."

"I'm sure that President Trump will have a very productive conversation with Putin, once again, rooted in his unwavering commitment to peace."

In the same interview, **Gabbard** also hailed Trump's relationship with Indian Prime Minister [Narendra Modi](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/narendra-modi)
: "With President Trump's leadership in the United States, of course Prime Minister Modi's longstanding leadership here in India, we have two leaders of our two great countries who are very good friends and who are very focused on how we can strengthen those shared objectives and those shared interests."

What To Know

Macron warns against 'escalation' after Biden brands Putin 'butcher'
====================================================================

Kyiv (AFP) – France's President Emmanuel Macron warned Sunday against a verbal "escalation" of Russia's invasion in Ukraine, after US President Joe Biden branded Vladimir Putin a "butcher" who "cannot remain in power".

 ![Macron warns against 'escalation' after Biden brands Putin 'butcher'](https://s.france24.com/media/display/99f8a93a-e6c1-11ee-9116-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/img-default-F24.jpg)

The Kremlin had reacted in fury over Biden's comments which it said narrows the window for bilateral relations, with Russia's invasion of Ukraine now into a second month.

Macron said he would speak to Putin in the next two days to organise the evacuation of civilians from the heavily bombarded port city of Mariupol.

The French leader told broadcaster France 3 that he saw his task as "achieving first a ceasefire and then the total withdrawal of (Russian) troops by diplomatic means."

"If we want to do that, we can't escalate either in words or actions."

Ukraine was making a new push to get civilians out of the city on Sunday, with an aid route agreement for people to leave by cars or on evacuation buses, said Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk.

Several attempts at establishing safe routes for civilians to flee have collapsed as both sides trade blame for violating temporary ceasefires.

Mariupol, in the region of Donetsk, has borne the brunt of Russia's assaults, and residents who managed to flee have recounted harrowing scenes of death and destruction.

About 170,000 people remain trapped in the besieged city and authorities have said they fear some 300 civilians may have died in a Russian strike on March 17 that hit a theatre being used as a bomb shelter.

Several attempts at establishing safe routes for civilians to flee have collapsed as both sides trade blame for violating temporary ceasefires FADEL SENNA AFP

In an impassioned speech from the Royal Castle in Warsaw, Biden blasted Putin over Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

"For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power," the US leader said, before the White House clarified that Washington was not seeking regime change.

The Kremlin snapped back, saying "a head of state should stay sober".

'Going to die anyway'
---------------------

Personal attacks, said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, were "narrowing down the window of opportunity" for bilateral relations.

"Biden is weak, sick and unhappy," said Vyacheslav Volodin, president of the lower house of parliament.

Putin sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, vowing to destroy the country's military and topple pro-Western President Volodymyr Zelensky.

But his army has made little progress on capturing key cities, and it has hit hospitals, residential buildings and schools in increasingly deadly attacks on civilians.

In Kharkiv, where authorities reported 44 artillery strikes and 140 rocket assaults in a single day, residents were resigned to the incessant bombardments.

Anna Kolinichenko, who lives in a three-room flat with her sister and brother-in-law, said they do not even bother to head down to the cellar when the sirens go off.

"If a bomb drops, we're going to die anyway," she told AFP. Like a volcano is exploding, as if the earth explodes," she said as she rested on a chair at an evacuation centre on the outskirts of Kyiv.

Recapture town

"I write poems and when there are explosions I feel great inspiration."

Bombardments continued over the last 24 hours in Irpin, as well as other cities around Kyiv, said Ukrainian authorities.

With the conflict now into a second month, Ukraine's determined fighters continue to hold back Russia's far-bigger military Aleksey Filippov AFP

Ukraine's determined fighters continue to hold back Russia's far-bigger military on the frontlines, and some units are beginning to snatch back control.

Two people were killed by shelling in the village of Stanislav, close to the city of Kherson, where Ukrainian forces have mounted a counter-offensive.

In an update early Sunday, the Ukrainian General Staff said "the allied forces repulsed seven attacks" and destroyed eight tanks in the Donetsk and Lugansk areas of the Donbas.

The Ukrainian defence ministry said its forces had also recaptured Trostianets, a town near the Russian border that was one of the first to fall under Moscow's control.

Images published by the ministry showed Ukrainian soldiers and civilians among heavily damaged buildings and what appeared to be abandoned Russian military equipment.

Elsewhere, Russian forces took control of Slavutych, the town where workers at the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear plant live, briefly detaining the mayor, Ukrainian authorities said.

Residents of the town protested, prompting the Russians to fire shots in the air and lob stun grenades into the crowd, they added.

The International Atomic Energy Agency said it was "closely monitoring the situation" and was concerned about the ability of employees at Chernobyl to rotate and return to their homes to rest.

'One percent'
-------------

"There has been no staff rotation at the NPP for nearly a week now," the IAEA said.

Russia's army, which Western analysts said appeared bogged down by tactical, communications and logistics problems, had suggested on Friday it would shift its concentration to eastern Ukraine.

But Biden had cast doubt, saying he was "not sure" Moscow has indeed changed its objectives.

Biden, who was winding up a whirlwind visit to Poland after holding a series of urgent summits in Brussels with Western allies, met key Ukrainian cabinet ministers on Saturday.

In a possible shift on a plan to transfer Soviet-era fighter jets from Poland to Kyiv to boost Ukraine's firepower in the skies -- rejected last month by the Pentagon as too "high risk" -- Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the United States now did not object.

"As far as we can conclude, the ball is now on the Polish side," Kuleba said in written comments to AFP after the meeting.

In a video address, Zelensky reiterated a call for planes while urging allies to supply Ukraine with more weapons.

"During the meeting..."

**What was claimed:** A video shows the president of France, Emmanuel Macron, calling Vladimir Putin a “butcher” and commenting on his “war crimes” during a press conference with US president Donald Trump.

**Our verdict:** This isn’t quite right. Mr Macron referred to killings in the Ukrainian town of Bucha and mentioned war crimes, but did not describe President Putin as a “butcher”.

France's President Emmanuel Macron warned Sunday against a verbal "escalation" of Russia's invasion in Ukraine, after US President Joe Biden branded Vladimir Putin a "butcher" who "cannot remain in power."

The Kremlin had reacted in fury over Biden's comments which it said narrows the window for bilateral relations, with Russia's invasion of Ukraine now into a second month.

Macron said he would speak to Putin in the next two days to organize the evacuation of civilians from the heavily bombarded port city of Mariupol.

The French leader told broadcaster France 3 that he saw his task as "achieving first a ceasefire and then the total withdrawal of (Russian) troops by diplomatic means."

"If we want to do that, we can't escalate either in words or actions."

Ukraine was making a new push to get civilians out of the city on Sunday, with an aid route agreement for people to leave by cars or on evacuation buses, said Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk.

Several attempts at establishing safe routes for civilians to flee have collapsed as both sides trade blame for violating temporary ceasefires.

Mariupol, in the region of Donetsk, has borne the brunt of Russia's assaults, and residents who managed to flee have recounted harrowing scenes of death and destruction.

About 170,000 people remain trapped in the besieged city and authorities have said they fear some 300 civilians may have died in a Russian strike on March 17 that hit a theatre being used as a bomb shelter.

In an impassioned speech from the Royal Castle in Warsaw, Biden blasted Putin over Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

"For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power," the US leader said, before the White House clarified that Washington was not seeking regime change.

The Kremlin snapped back, saying "a head of state should stay sober."

### **“Going to die anyway”**

Personal attacks, said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, were "narrowing down the window of opportunity" for bilateral relations.

"Biden is weak, sick and unhappy," said Vyacheslav Volodin, president of the lower house of parliament.

Putin sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, vowing to destroy the country's military and topple pro-Western President Volodymyr Zelensky.

But his army has made little progress on capturing key cities, and it has hit hospitals, residential buildings and schools in increasingly deadly attacks on civilians.

In Kharkiv, where authorities reported 44 artillery strikes and 140 rocket assaults in a single day, residents were resigned to the incessant bombardments.

Anna Kolinichenko, who lives in a three-room flat with her sister and brother-in-law, said they do not even bother to head down to the cellar when the sirens go off.

"If a bomb drops, we're going to die anyway," she told AFP. <image:1440>\

### **Recapture town**

"I write poems and when there are explosions I feel great inspiration."

Bombardments continued over the last 24 hours in Irpin, as well as other cities around Kyiv, said Ukrainian authorities.

Ukraine's determined fighters continue to hold back Russia's far-bigger military on the frontlines, and some units are beginning to snatch back control.

Two people were killed by shelling in the village of Stanislav, close to the city of Kherson, where Ukrainian forces have mounted a counter-offensive.

In an update early Sunday, the Ukrainian General Staff said "the allied forces repulsed seven attacks" and destroyed eight tanks in the Donetsk and Lugansk areas of the Donbas.

The Ukrainian defense ministry said its forces had also recaptured Trostianets, a town near the Russian border that was one of the first to fall under Moscow's control.

Images published by the ministry showed Ukrainian soldiers and civilians among heavily damaged buildings and what appeared to be abandoned Russian military equipment.

Elsewhere, Russian forces took control of Slavutych, the town where workers at the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear plant live, briefly detaining the mayor, Ukrainian authorities said.

Residents of the town protested, prompting the Russians to fire shots in the air and lob stun grenades into the crowd, they added.

The International Atomic Energy Agency said it was "closely monitoring the situation" and was concerned about the ability of employees at Chernobyl to rotate and return to their homes to rest.

### **"One percent"**

"There has been no staff rotation at the NPP for nearly a week now," the IAEA said.

Russia's army, which Western analysts said appeared bogged down by tactical, communications and logistics problems, had suggested on Friday it would shift its concentration to eastern Ukraine.

But Biden had cast doubt, saying he was "not sure" Moscow has indeed changed its objectives.

Biden, who was winding up a whirlwind visit to Poland after holding a series of urgent summits in Brussels with Western allies, met key Ukrainian cabinet ministers on Saturday.

In a possible shift on a plan to transfer Soviet-era fighter jets from Poland to Kyiv to boost Ukraine's firepower in the skies -- rejected last month by the Pentagon as too "high risk" — Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the United States now did not object.

"As far as we can conclude, the ball is now on the Polish side," Kuleba said in written comments to AFP after the meeting.

In a video address, Zelensky reiterated a call for planes while urging allies to supply Ukraine with more weapons.

"We need more ammunition. <image:1437>\

CNN  — 

Vice President JD Vance warned on Thursday that the United States could hit Russia with economic and military “tools of leverage” if Russian leader Vladimir Putin doesn’t negotiate a peace deal with Ukraine in good faith.

Speaking to the Wall Street Journal on Thursday, Vance said the option of sending US troops to Ukraine was “on the table,” as well as economic punishment if a peace deal doesn’t guarantee Kyiv’s long-term independence.

“There are economic tools of leverage, there are of course military tools of leverage,” Vance told the newspaper.

His comments strike a different tone from other recent statements from the White House – including from US President Donald Trump who [suggested this week](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/11/europe/ukraine-russia-trump-zelensky-intl/index.html)
 that Ukraine “may be Russian someday,” shortly before announcing that peace negotiations would begin immediately after holding a phone call with Putin.

Vance’s statement also contrasts with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who has said the US would no longer prioritize European and Ukrainian security. (AP Photo/Alex Babenko)\

The Wall Street Journal interview was published before Vance was set to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the high-level Munich Security Conference in Germany.

On arrival in Munich Vance said NATO remains an important alliance for the United States.

“Europe is of course a very important ally to the United States, NATO is a very important military alliance … but we want to make sure NATO is actually built for the future, and part of that is ensuring that NATO does a little bit more burden-sharing in Europe so the United States can focus on some of our challenges in East Asia,” Vance said, speaking to reporters beside NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte.

An air of uncertainty and anxiety that has enveloped Europe in the past week, after Trump’s announcement [sparked fears that a “dirty deal”](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/13/europe/europe-dirty-deal-trump-putin-ukraine-deal-intl/index.html)
 may be struck with Putin to end the war on terms favorable to Moscow without Kyiv’s involvement.

Many in Europe were shocked Trump appeared to make key concessions to Moscow before even agreeing to peace talks. [](#maincontent)

Volodymyr Zelenskyy, president of Ukraine speaks to the press during a media briefing on the territory of Khmelnytskyi Nuclear Power Plant, Ukraine, Thursday, Feb. This week, he told NATO allies that European and non-European troops – but not Americans – would have to police any agreement between Ukraine and Russia.

CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.

[![Volodymyr Zelenskyy, president of Ukraine speaks to the press during a media briefing on the territory of Khmelnytskyi Nuclear Power Plant, Ukraine, Thursday, Feb. His and Hegseth’s comments also threw into question the future of NATO’s future unity, resources and funding, a cornerstone of European security since the Second World War.

There was also surprise that Trump spoke to Putin before speaking to Zelensky, with European leaders on Thursday scrambling to make clear any peace deal would have to involve Ukraine at the heart of negotiations.

After Trump’s announcement of the peace deal negotiations, French President Emmanuel Macron also described his return to the White House as an “electroshock” for Europe in an interview with the Financial Times.

Macron underlined the need for Europe to strengthen its economy and defenses, agreeing with Trump’s stance that Ukraine’s security was a European responsibility. 13, 2025. 13, 2025. But he also emphasized that only Ukraine could negotiate for itself, and that any peace that was a “capitulation” would be bad news for everyone.

A century after a landmark treaty rekindled ties between [Japan](https://www.scmp.com/topics/japan?module=inline&pgtype=article)
 and the Soviet Union, a new era of tension shows just how fragile relations between Tokyo and Moscow have become.

[Russia](https://www.scmp.com/topics/russia?module=inline&pgtype=article)
 marked the Soviet–Japanese Basic Convention’s 100th anniversary with a pointed statement last week that seemed less about history and more about present animosities.

“The Russian side proceeds from the fact that even today in Japan there are sensible politicians and public figures who are aware of the harmfulness of the anti-Russian course of the official authorities, its negative consequences for the Japanese people,” said the foreign ministry in a statement on January 20.

For many observers, this seemed a bitter irony, given the current state of affairs.

Relations between the two countries have plummeted in recent years, particularly [since 2022](https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/east-asia/article/3171349/ukraine-war-japan-slams-russia-move-end-disputed-kuril-islands?module=inline&pgtype=article)
, when Moscow officially designated Japan as an “unfriendly country” after Tokyo joined Western nations in imposing sanctions over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. They are at rock bottom,” said James Brown, a professor of international relations specialising in Russian affairs at Temple University’s Tokyo campus.

Tokyo Declaration on Japan-Russia Relations  
(PROVISIONAL TRANSLATION)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

### The Prime Minister of Japan and The President of the Russian Federation

    Based upon the recognition that, with the end of the Cold war, the world is moving away from the structure of confrontation towards cooperation which will open new vistas for advances in international cooperation on both global and regional levels as well as in bilateral relations between different countries, and that this is creating favorable conditions for the full normalization of the Japan-Russia bilateral relations;

As the Sino-Soviet split developed in the 1960s, border tensions emerged.[\[10\]](#cite_note-:02-10)
: 150  Amid heightening tensions, the Soviet Union and China began border talks. Zhou ended his speech with a barely veiled call for the people of Czechoslovakia to wage guerrilla war against the [Red Army](/wiki/Red_Army "Red Army")

The Chinese historian Li Danhui wrote, "Already in 1968, China began preparations to create a small war on the border." She noted that prior to March 1969, the Chinese troops had twice attempted to provoke a clash along the border, "but the Soviets, feeling weak, did not accept the Chinese challenge and retreated." Another Chinese historian, Yang Kuisong, wrote, "There were already significant preparations in 1968, but the Russians did not come, so the planned ambush was not successful."[\[16\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGoldstein200359-16)

Western historians believe that the events at Zhenbao Island and the subsequent border clashes in Xinjiang were caused mainly by Mao's use of Chinese local military superiority to satisfy domestic political imperatives in 1969.[\[53\]](#cite_note-53)
 Yang Kuisong concludes that "the \[Sino-Soviet\] military clashes were primarily the result of Mao Zedong's domestic mobilization strategies, connected to his worries about the development of the Cultural Revolution."[\[54\]](#cite_note-54)

Russian historians point out that the consequences of the conflict stem directly from a Chinese desire to take a leading role in the world and to strengthen ties with the United States. According to the 2004 Russian documentary film, _Damansky Island Year 1969,_ Mao sought to elevate his country from the world's periphery and to place it at the centre of world politics.[\[55\]](#cite_note-55)
 Other analysts state that the Chinese intended their attack on Zhenbao to deter future Soviet invasions by demonstrating that China could not be "bullied".[\[7\]](#cite_note-cna.org-7)

### Result

Most scholars and analysts describe this conflict to have resulted in a Soviet victory, because the conflict was not over what a final border deal between the USSR and China would look like. The agreement also includes the Chinese gain of ownership of Yinlong / Tarabarov Island and half of [Heixiazi / Bolshoi Ussuriysky Island](/wiki/Heixiazi_Island "Heixiazi Island")
.[\[59\]](#cite_note-59)

In the 21st century, the Chinese Communist Party's version of the conflict, which is present on many official Party websites, describes the events of March 1969 as a Soviet aggression against China.[\[60\]](#cite_note-60)

 Noteworthy is that China did not recognize the illegal annexation of either the Crimean Peninsula or the Ukrainian regions occupied since 2014 or since 2022; on the contrary, China’s conflict settlement plan published in 2023 stands clearly for the territorial integrity of all states.[23](#footnote_22_40842 "Gabuev, Alexander. This avoidance of binding military commitments ensures that while the two countries may collaborate on military technology and engage in joint military exercises, China’s participation remains measured and does not extend to active military involvement in Russia’s conflicts. China, in particular, is cautious about being associated too closely with Russia in military engagements, especially in conflict zones where its own strategic interests could be jeopardized.

Partnership Short of Alliance: Military Cooperation Between Russia and China
============================================================================

The growing military-technical partnership between Russia and China has become an influential factor in shaping global security dynamics.

June 16, 2025[](#image-credit)

**Executive Summary:**
----------------------

*   Before 2014**,** military cooperation between Russia and China was characterized by pragmatic, practical considerations: Russia contributed to the modernization of China’s armed forces by selling various types of weaponry, while Beijing was a lucrative market for Russia’s military-industrial complex.
*   Since the illegal annexation of Crimea, Russia has lost access both to  Ukraine’s defense industry and to its Western military-industrial partners. This has left Russia with China as the sole remaining major source of much-needed imported military technology and components. While Russia and China share a strong anti-US stance, Beijing is unwilling to limit its own strategic autonomy and freedom of maneuver by making any commitment to Russia that would lead to an open conflict with the West or the introduction of sanctions. 
*   A prime example of the limits of Sino-Russian relations is Beijing’s refusal to officially recognize any Russian territorial gains since 2014. Limited trust is also reflected in the joint Russian-Sino military exercises, as these maneuvers are more about demonstrating the will of cooperation to the outside world than improving interoperability between Russian and Chinese armed forces.
*   Due to these limitations, while military cooperation along shared interests will continue, it is extremely unlikely that it will develop into any functioning, institutionalized alliance.

The growing military-technical partnership between Russia and China has become an increasingly influential factor in shaping global security dynamics, particularly in the context of Russia’s ongoing full-scale war against Ukraine. Nevertheless, we can draw some conclusions about the general trends of military cooperation between the two countries, especially given the absence of certain actions and commitments, which are indicative of the limits of their military cooperation.

The Beginning: A Pragmatic, Practical Partnership
-------------------------------------------------

The military cooperation of post-Soviet Russia and China began as a relatively straightforward arms trade relationship in the 1990s and has evolved into a complex partnership. “China’s Very First Aircraft Carrier Was Built in Ukraine.” The National Interest, March 28, 2025. https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/chinas-very-first-aircraft-carrier-was-built-ukraine-207796")
 Albeit the latter was sold by Ukraine, the transfer could not have taken place without at least the tacit consent of Russia.

In this period before 2014, the two sides had asymmetric, but conveniently complementary, motivations to cooperate: China needed Russia’s military-technological know-how, while the Russian defense industry was eager to sell weaponry to China.

For China, acquiring Russian technology has long served a dual purpose: It enhances Beijing’s military capabilities and provides a foundation for the development of indigenous weapons systems through military-industrial cannibalization."

German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi speak to the media following talks on July 3, in Berlin.

CNN  — 

Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told the European Union’s top diplomat that Beijing can’t accept Russia losing its war against Ukraine as this could allow the United States to turn its full attention to China, an official briefed on the talks said, contradicting Beijing’s public position of neutrality in the conflict.

The admission came during what the official said was a four-hour meeting with EU foreign affairs chief Kaja Kallas on Wednesday in Brussels that “featured tough but respectful exchanges, covering a broad range of issues from cyber security, rare earths to trade imbalances, Taiwan and Middle East.”

The official said Wang’s private remarks suggested Beijing might prefer a protracted war in Ukraine that keeps the United States from focusing on its rivalry with China. They echo concerns of critics of China’s policy that Beijing has geopolitically much more at stake in the Ukrainian conflict than its admitted position of neutrality.

On Friday, at a regular Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs briefing, spokeswoman Mao Ning was asked about the exchange, which was first reported in [the South China Morning Post](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3316875/china-tells-eu-it-cannot-afford-russian-loss-ukraine-war-sources-say)
, and re-affirmed Beijing’s long-standing position on the three-year war.

“China is not a party to the Ukraine issue,” Mao said. A prolonged Ukraine crisis serves no one’s interests.”

She added that China wanted a political settlement as quickly as possible: “Together with the international community and in light of the will of the parties concerned, we will continue playing a constructive role towards this end.”

China’s public statements on the Ukraine war mask a more complex picture.

Just weeks before Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Chinese leader Xi Jinping declared a “no limits” partnership with Moscow and since then political and economic ties have strengthened.

China has put itself forward as a possible peacemaker, but as CNN [has previously reported](https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2025%2F02%2F12%2Fchina%2Fchina-trump-ukraine-war-putin-xi-jinping-intl-hnk&data=05%7C02%7Cnick.thompson%40cnn.com%7C8c9e0ba600894c20653608ddbb03fac9%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638872347943204106%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=ejhk%2BABRvFRLAF5J5MlbKyP0XayP6n%2BwyN36aFfOKoU%3D&reserved=0)
 the stakes are high for Beijing, not least potentially losing a major partner in Russia.

China has also rejected growing accusations it is providing near-military support to Russia. One image displayed part of the drone’s alleged fuselage which said the device was made in China on June 20.

Sybiha added that night the “Chinese Consulate General’s building in Odesa suffered minor damage as a result of Russian strikes on the city. “China’s position on the Ukraine crisis is objective and consistent, that is, negotiation, ceasefire and peace. Ukraine has sanctioned several Chinese companies for providing Russia drone components and technology for use in missile production.

Japan-Russia relations have been strained, especially since 2022, when Japan imposed sanctions on Russia following the invasion of Ukraine, as detailed in an article from the South China Morning Post ([https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3296430/rock-bottom-100-years-japan-russia-ties-come-full-circle](https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3296430/rock-bottom-100-years-japan-russia-ties-come-full-circle)). The history of Japan-Russia relations, including the Russo-Japanese War and current relations, is discussed on Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan%E2%80%93Russia_relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan%E2%80%93Russia_relations)).

The Tokyo Declaration on Japan-Russia Relations, from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan ([https://www.mofa.go.jp/region/n-america/us/q&a/declaration.html](https://www.mofa.go.jp/region/n-america/us/q&a/declaration.html)), discusses the importance of normalizing relations, promoting peace, and continuing dialogue.


## Elaboration
The evidence focuses on Japan-Russia relations, highlighting historical tensions and current strains due to the war in Ukraine. The sources also mention Japan's sanctions against Russia.

The provided sources do not mention any invasion plans by China or Japan against Russia.

The claim cannot be verified due to a lack of evidence.

The **Russo-Japanese War**[\[6\]](#cite_note-6)
 (8 February 1904 – 5 September 1905) was fought between the [Russian Empire](/wiki/Russian_Empire "Russian Empire")
 and the [Empire of Japan](/wiki/Empire_of_Japan "Empire of Japan")
 over rival imperial ambitions in [Manchuria](/wiki/Manchuria "Manchuria")
 and the [Korean Empire](/wiki/Korean_Empire "Korean Empire")
. The complete military victory of an Asian and non-Western nation over a European and Western power surprised international observers, and transformed the global balance of power, with the Empire of Japan emerging as a [great power](/wiki/Great_power "Great power")
 and the Russian Empire declining in prestige among the European powers. Your devoted friend and cousin, Willy, Admiral of the Atlantic.[\[33\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTERöhl2014183-33)

Wilhelm aggressively encouraged Russia's ambitions in Asia because [France, Russia's closest ally](/wiki/Franco-Russian_Alliance "Franco-Russian Alliance")
 since 1894, was less than supportive of Russian expansionism in Asia, and it was believed in Berlin that German support of Russia might break up the Franco-Russian alliance and lead to a new German–Russian alliance.[\[30\]](#cite_note-McLean2003_121-30)
 The French had made it clear that they disapproved of Nicholas's forward policy in Asia; the French Premier [Maurice Rouvier](/wiki/Maurice_Rouvier "Maurice Rouvier")
 (in office: May to December 1887) publicly declaring that the Franco-Russian alliance applied only in Europe, not to Asia,[\[34\]](#cite_note-34)
 and that France would remain neutral if Japan attacked Russia.[\[35\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTERöhl2014252–253-35)

 (in office 1901–1909), who was attempting to mediate the Russian–Japanese dispute, complained that Wilhelm's "Yellow Peril" propaganda, which strongly implied that Germany might go to war against Japan in support of Russia, encouraged Russian intransigence.[\[36\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFiebi-von_Hase2003163-36)
 On 24 July 1905, in a letter to the British diplomat [Cecil Spring Rice](/wiki/Cecil_Spring_Rice "Cecil Spring Rice")
, Roosevelt wrote that Wilhelm bore partial responsibility for the war as "he has done all he could to bring it about", charging that Wilhelm's constant warnings about the "Yellow Peril" had made the Russians uninterested in compromise as Nicholas believed that Germany would intervene if Japan attacked.[\[37\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFiebi-von_Hase2003163–164-37)

The implicit promise of German support suggested by Wilhelm's "Yellow Peril" speeches and letters to Nicholas led many decision-makers in [Saint Petersburg](/wiki/Saint_Petersburg "Saint Petersburg")
 to believe that Russia's military weaknesses in the Far East (like the uncompleted Trans-Siberian railroad line) did not matter – they assumed that the _Reich_ would come to Russia's assistance if war should come. Recognition on the part of Russia of the exclusive right of Japan to give advice and assistance in the interest of reform and good government in Korea, including necessary military assistance.
6. Instead, Russia's goal was buying time – via diplomacy – to further build up militarily.[\[44\]](#cite_note-KodaNWCR2005-44)
 In December 1903, Wilhelm wrote in a marginal note on a diplomatic dispatch about his role in inflaming Russo–Japanese relations:

> Since 97 – Kiaochow – we have never left Russia in any doubt that we would cover her back in Europe, in case she decided to pursue a bigger policy in the Far East that might lead to military complications (with the aim of relieving our eastern border from the fearful pressure and threat of the massive Russian army!). This notion conflicts with a comment made by Nicholas to Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany, saying there would be no war because he "did not wish it".[\[52\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTESchimmelpenninck_van_der_Oye200542-52)
 This does not reject the claim that Russia played an aggressive role in the East, which it did; rather, it means that Russia unwisely calculated and supposed that Japan would not go to war against Russia's far larger and seemingly superior navy and army. Nicholas held the Japanese in contempt as "yellow monkeys", and he took for granted that the Japanese would simply yield in the face of Russia's superior power, which thus explains his unwillingness to compromise.[\[53\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEJukes200216–20-53)
 Evidence of Russia's false sense of security and superiority to Japan is seen by Russian reference to Japan's choosing war as a big mistake.[\[54\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEJukes200221-54)

Japan had conducted detailed studies of the Russian Far East and Manchuria prior to the war and, as it was mandatory for Japanese officers to speak one foreign language, Japan had access to superior maps during the conflict. The gesture was symbolic and no soldiers from the army were ever deployed in the far East but a few Montenegrins volunteered and joined the Russian army.[\[68\]](#cite_note-68)

From [Source](https://www.asianstudies.org/publications/eaa/archives/the-russo-japanese-war-and-world-history/): 
Content: "The impact of Japan’s military victories, and likewise, Russia’s defeat, therefore, marked the beginning of a new century now commonly accepted as the era of total global conflict. Always considered a bilateral engagement between two military powers, which it was in its most basic sense, the Russo-Japanese war also had a significant global impact.

Although the idea is controversial, the Russo-Japanese War could be considered “World War Zero” for a host of reasons, beginning with the newly developed capacity of industrialized powers to wage war on an unprecedented scale on Far Eastern battlefields and oceans.1 The debate that emerged over the concept of World War Zero underscores the significance of the Russo-Japanese War to twentieth century history, in that a fundamental question emerges: was the conflict that occurred between Russia and Japan a precursor to World War I, and, as such, the original example of the type of conflict that occurred in the first half of the twentieth century?2 In its broadest sense, the age of Imperialism reached its apex between 1904 and 1905 when Russia, a traditional European power, confronted Japan, the rising Asian power, in China and Korea, both self-proclaimed and internationally recognized neutral countries. With this fact as an essential historical precedent, appreciating the broad impact of the Russo-Japanese War on the belligerent nationals, as well as on the history of the world, heightens the understanding of the war, not only in military and political, but also in social and cultural terms.4

From the time it began, military observers, journalists, and analysts, and later on military historians, treated the Russo-Japanese War as a regional conflict that resulted in an unexpected outcome. Japan’s victory started them down the road of creating an Asia for Asians, while the people of Asia recognized that a new military power had asserted its authority in their region of the world.

http://ocw.mit.edu/ans7870/21f/21f.027/throwing\_off\_asia\_03/toa\_vis\_02.html.

The actual military engagements of the Russo-Japanese War, however, are not what allow us to refer to the conflict as World War Zero. What makes this war different from the German Wars of Unification, or the more recent Spanish-American and Boer wars, was the scope of international involvement that occurred during and after the conflict.

!photo of women in dresses and men in military uniforms <image:2521>

English nurses sent by the Queen to inspect the workings of the Japanese Red Cross. Be it through French loans to Russia, or Japanese loans from a syndicate of British and/or American bankers, the belligerent nations needed to reach outside of their own resources to finance this conflict. The outcome of this war redefined international relations in a way that fostered a series of conflicts, culminating in the second half of the twentieth century with the globalization of the world.

At the root of this question rests the issue of why the Russo-Japanese War occurred at all. Both Russia and Japan had imperial ambitions over the territories where they fought—Manchuria and Korea."

Russia and China have separately warned Japan over its decision to allow the United States to deploy [“Typhon” intermediate-range missiles](/news/2024/12/23/philippines-angers-china-with-plans-to-buy-us-typhon-missile-system)
 during joint military exercises in Japan next month, calling the move a threat to regional stability.

“We view this as another destabilising step as part of Washington’s course toward ramping up the potential of ground-based shorter and intermediate-range missiles,” Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Friday.

Deploying Typhon missiles “in regions near Russia poses [a direct strategic threat](/news/2024/7/28/putin-warns-us-of-cold-war-style-crisis-if-missiles-deployed-to)
 to Russia”, Zakharova said in comments published by the country’s state-run TASS news agency.

Moscow has also taken note of Japan’s moves towards “accelerated militarisation” and cooperation with the US, the spokeswoman said.

If Japan does not rethink its decision on the Typhon’s deployment, Russia “will have to take appropriate military-technical measures”, she said.

“We will assume that the entire responsibility for the further degradation of the situation in the region rests on the Japanese side,” she added.

Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Guo Jiakun said on Friday that the US and Japan should contribute to regional peace and stability and not undermine it with the deployment of medium-range missiles, even if only temporarily.

“China always opposes the United States deploying the Typhon Mid-Range Capability missile system in Asian countries,” Guo said, according to the state-run Xinhua news agency.

“We urge Japan to take a hard look at its history of aggression, follow the path of peaceful development, act prudently in military and security areas, and refrain from further losing the trust of its Asian neighbours and the international community,” he said.

Guo said China also called on Washington to “draw lessons from history and devote more effort and resources to doing the right thing rather than the other way around”.

The Reuters news agency reports that the Typhon system is part of a drive by Washington to amass a variety of antiship weapons in Asia.

That move already led to an earlier rebuke from China when the missiles were first deployed in the Philippines during a training exercise in 2024.

Manila has since announced plans to buy the land-based US missile system, which has a range of some 480km (300 miles), though a longer-range version is currently being developed.

A spokesperson for Japan’s Ground Self-Defence Force told Reuters the Typhon would be deployed to the US Marine Air Station in Iwakuni city, on Honshu island, some 890km (553 miles) west of Tokyo.

It was unclear if Typhon missiles would be fired as part of the “Resolute Dragon” exercises between US and Japanese forces that run from September 11 to 25.

**Pavel Podvig, head of the Strategic Nuclear Weapons of Russia project, told Russian outlet RBC:** "There is no qualitatively new and more serious threat to Russia here, rather the statement is more of symbolism."

Although the drills end on Tuesday, Japan's Ministry of Defense warned that China's military cooperation with Russia poses serious security concerns.

Meanwhile, Medvedev has not posted on social media since July 31, and Russian media outlets have largely not reacted to his spat with Trump, which could suggest a truce in the online war of words.

's ally.

The Maritime Interaction 2025 exercises with Beijing had been planned before Trump denounced as "foolish and inflammatory" nuclear threats from former Russian President [Dmitry Medvedev](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/dmitry-medvedev)
.

But the drills are the latest sign of deepening military cooperation between the countries as Trump's announcement adds to growing tensions between Moscow and Washington.

Why It Matters
--------------

Before Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia and China signed a "no limits" strategic partnership, and since then, their military and economic ties have increased, although Beijing has claimed neutrality in the war.

China and Russia have carried out annual drills for years, but the latest ones come at a sensitive time in which Trump has expressed his growing anger with Putin and responded to Medvedev's nuclear saber rattling.

What To Know
------------

The navies of Russia and China are conducting joint artillery and anti-submarine drills in the Sea of Japan, near the Russian port of Vladivostok, as part of the "Maritime Interaction-2025" exercise, Russian officials said on Sunday.

Russian and Chinese media said the drills involved the joint detachment of Russian and Chinese warships, including a large Russian anti-submarine vessel and two Chinese destroyers.

Also taking part were diesel-electric submarines from both countries and a Chinese submarine rescue ship.

Four Chinese vessels, including guided-missile destroyers _Shaoxing_ and _Urumqi_, were taking part, according to China's Defense Ministry.

The drills, which are scheduled to end on Tuesday, include artillery fire exercises, anti-submarine warfare training, air defense operations, and joint search and rescue missions.

They follow Trump's comments on Friday that he had ordered the deployment of U.S. Inconsistencies may occur.

Medvedev, who was Russian president between 2008 and 2012 and is now deputy chairman of the Federation Council, issued a veiled nuclear threat against the U.S. and Russia throughout the Cold War.

"Having said that, any shift in nuclear posture should be carefully calibrated, and act as a deterrent and not a prelude to unchecked increased tensions," Murrett added.

It cites a similar situation in the South China Sea and says PLA actions there are a legitimate Japanese concern because Tokyo has major sea lanes running through the waterway.

Jiang Bin, a spokesperson for China’s Defense Ministry, said Wednesday that Japan was “hyping up the ‘China threat,’ and grossly interfering in China’s internal affairs.”

“The Japanese side is fabricating false narratives to find excuses for loosening its military constraints,” Jiang said, referring to Japan’s strict post-war constitution, which limits its military forces to self-defense only.

And Japan’s invocation of World War II is controversial in a region where fissures over Tokyo’s devastating militarism during the period sour relations with many of its neighbors to this day.

“We urge the Japanese side to deeply learn from history, cease slandering and accusing China,” Jiang said.

But the Japanese paper didn’t only focus on Beijing’s unilateral actions.

As part of its expanded activities, the PLA is increasing cooperation with Russian armed forces, including joint bomber flights and naval patrols near Japan, the paper says.

“These repeated joint activities are clearly intended for demonstration of force against Japan,” it says.

The report says that in the past fiscal year Japanese fighter jets scrambled 704 times, including 464 times in response to approaching Chinese aircraft and 237 times for Russian aircraft, a rate of almost two scrambles a day.

Russia’s three-and-a-half-year-old invasion of Ukraine, along with the buildup in the Russian military that has come with it, is a worry for Japan, especially because of its status as a key US ally, the report says.

“The security of Europe and the Indo-Pacific is inseparable,” it says, and warns that a Ukraine-like war is possible in the region – without specifically mentioning where that might occur.

The report says some of Russia’s newest military hardware has been deployed to the Pacific.

Moscow has added troops, missiles and warplanes to islands north of Japan, which the Soviet Union took toward the end of World War II, but which Japan says are sovereign Japanese territory illegally occupied now by Russia.

North Korea, meanwhile, is further developing nuclear weapons and the ballistic missiles to deliver them, the report says.

Pyongyang’s ballistic missiles, believed to be capable of carrying nuclear warheads, can cover the entirety of the Japanese archipelago, it says.

“North Korea’s military activities are posing an even more grave and imminent threat to Japan’s security than ever before,” the paper says.

The Japanese paper echoed many of the concerns the head of the US military’s Indo-Pacific Command, Adm. [](#maincontent)

Seoul, South Korea CNN  — 

Japan is facing its most severe security environment since World War II as three potential adversaries in East Asia – China, Russia and North Korea – ramp up military activities in the region, the country’s defense minister said Tuesday.

“The existing order of world peace is being seriously challenged, and Japan finds itself in the most severe and complex security environment of the post-war era,” Defense Minister Gen Nakatani said in an introduction to the ministry’s annual defense white paper.

China’s military activities present “an unprecedented and the greatest strategic challenge” to Japan, the report said.

Beijing is “rapidly enhancing its military capability in a qualitative and quantitative manner” while “intensifying” activities around the region, Nakatani said, specifically mentioning the Senkaku Islands, a chain in the East China Sea that Tokyo controls but which is also claimed by Beijing, which calls them the Diaoyus.

![An aerial photo shows Chinese marine surveillance ship Haijian No. In particular, the inter-state competition between the United States and China is likely to intensify even further in future,” the white paper says.

The paper says escalating Chinese military activity around the democratically controlled island of Taiwan poses a threat.

“China seeks to create a fait accompli where the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is operating, and improve its actual combat capabilities,” it says.

[![U.S. Samuel Paparo, voiced in a posture paper in April.

“China continues to pursue unprecedented military modernization and increasingly aggressive behavior that threatens the U.S. homeland, our allies, and our partners,” Paparo said.

The US commander also said the deepening cooperation between China and Russia as well as North Korea presents an increasing threat in the Pacific.

“Together, these countries’ growing ties create a complex, interconnected challenge to U.S. 66 (top) trying to approach a Japanese fishing boat (bottom) as Japan Coast Guard vessel Ishigaki cruises next to the Chinese ship, in the East China Sea, near what are known as the Senkaku isles in Japan and the Diaoyu islands in China, in this photo taken on April 23, 2013.](https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2013-04-23t120000z-1834268566-gm1e94n0vjk01-rtrmadp-3-japan-china.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill)

The 34-page document gives a dire outlook on the future of the region, especially on the rivalry between China and the United States, Tokyo’s most important ally.

“The global balance of power is shifting dramatically and competition among states continues."

Lavrov said Russia understands North Korea’s decision to seek nuclear weapons.

“The technologies used by North Korea are the result of the work of its own scientists. nuclear-capable bombers near the Korean Peninsula, as their top military officers met in Seoul and urged North Korea to cease all unlawful activities that threaten regional security.

North Korea views major U.S.-led military drills as invasion rehearsals. We respect North Korea’s aspirations and understand the reasons why it is pursuing a nuclear development,” Lavrov said.

During their meeting, Choe reiterated that North Korea “unconditionally” supports Russia’s fight against Ukraine. She described ties between North Korea and Russia as “the invincible alliance.”

Lavrov said he repeated Russia’s gratitude for the contribution that North Korean troops made in efforts to repel a Ukrainian incursion into Russia’s Kursk border region.

Wonsan city, the meeting venue, is where North Korea recently opened a mammoth beach resort that it says can accommodate nearly 20,000 people.

In his comments at the start of his meeting with Choe, Lavrov said that “I am sure that Russian tourists will be increasingly eager to come here. We will do everything we can to facilitate this, creating conditions for this, including air travel,” according to the Russian Foreign Ministry.

The Wonsan-Kalma tourist zone is at the center of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s push to boost tourism as a way to improve his country’s troubled economy."

[!Russia Notes US Hypocrisy in California Fire Case <image:4830>](/en/news/2025/01/12/3236714/russia-notes-us-hypocrisy-in-california-fire-case)

### TEHRAN (Tasnim) - Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova commented on reports that hundreds of prisoners have been mobilized to extinguish fires in the US state of California, pointing to the hypocrisy of the US.

[\- Other Media news -](/en/service/1200/other-media)

Earlier, The Washington Post, citing the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, reported that the state authorities had sent 395 prisoners to fight forest fires. The diplomat noted that in 2023, Washington restricted imports of products from several Chinese companies in an attempt to exclude goods allegedly produced with the help of Uygur forced labor from the US supply chain.

"This raises a logical question: will Congress draft a bill imposing sanctions on California authorities, private companies, and ordinary Americans for using prison labor to put out fires?" she wondered. "We are so sick of this hypocrisy!" Zakharova added.

Wildfires began to spread across Los Angeles County on January 7."

Did Russia offer sanctuary to California residents who lost their homes in the Los Angeles fires? A viral X [post](https://x.com/jacksonhinklle/status/1879042008465183185)
 by Jackson Hinkle—a [regular purveyor](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/11/business/media/jackson-hinkle-israel-gaza-misinformation.html)
 of Russia-related misinformation—claims so.

“BREAKING: RUSSIA has offered shelter & sanctuary to Californians whose livelihoods were DESTROYED in the LA wildfires,” reads the post, which had more than 500,000 views on X as of January 15.

Assessing Claims That Russia Offered Sanctuary to California Fire Victims
=========================================================================

One Russian governor did make an offer, but there are some caveats.

! A single Russian governor said that he would welcome California fire victims to the region of occupied Ukraine he oversees, but only if they don’t support the government in Kyiv.

On Monday, Vladimir Saldo, the governor of the Russian-occupied Kherson oblast region of Ukraine, [told](https://tass.ru/obschestvo/22867057)
 _TASS_—a Russian state-controlled media outlet—that the region would accept any Americans who lost their homes in this month’s California fires. “Despite the ongoing, blatantly anti-Russian policy of the United States, we fully understand that natural disasters don’t care who you are or what you do,” Saldo said, [according to](https://www.rt.com/russia/610836-california-fires-sanctuary-kherson/)
 Russia Today, a Russian state-controlled network that translated the statement into English. Therefore, our region is ready to welcome any American citizen who has lost their home and livelihood.”

That offer comes with a caveat, applying only to Californians who haven’t supported Ukraine since Russia invaded its borders in February 2022. Sutton")

Other Russian Telegram channels are also spreading false or unverified narratives about the southern California fires and the government's response, as well as amplifying critiques from Americans including the president-elect's son, Donald Trump, Jr., Andy Carvin of the Atlantic Council's DFRLab told NPR in an email. The Russian news site [Pravda](https://web.archive.org/web/20250115205032/https://news-pravda.com/world/2025/01/08/963104.html)

"Over the last week, Pravda has published at least 350 stories of this type \[based on Telegram messages about the fires\], based on our initial content analysis of the site," Carvin said.

Russia exploits wildfires in Los Angeles to push anti-US, anti-Ukraine propaganda

Russia exploits wildfires in Los Angeles to push anti-US, anti-Ukraine propaganda

#### Maria Zakharova

Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman

U.S. uses forced labor by involving inmates in fighting Los Angeles fires, while sanctioning China for using forced labor in Xinjiang.

[Source: RIA Novosti, January 12, 2025](https://ria.ru/20250112/zaharova-1993301092.html "Source: RIA Novosti, January 12, 2025")

False

Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova accused the United States of “obscurantist hypocrisy” for allowing inmates to fight Los Angeles wildfires. has been condemning for years.

"Hundreds of prisoners have been recruited to fight wildfires in southern California … In recent years, U.S. officials have repeatedly criticized China for using forced labor, especially in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region … \[W\]ill Congress impose sanctions on the California government, private companies, and ordinary Americans for using prison labor to fight fires."

The claim is false.

[In California, inmates voluntarily join firefighting crews](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/10/nx-s1-5254122/inmate-firefighters-california-wildfires)
 if they meet the program’s qualifications, which consider physical fitness and behavioral records. government is impoverishing its own citizens.

Speaking at a January 14 press conference on the results of Russian diplomacy in 2024, Lavrov said, that Americans “burned almost all of California,” and the damage is estimated $250 billion, which is “comparable” to what the U.S. pledged to [Ukraine](https://www.state.gov/bureau-of-political-military-affairs/releases/2025/01/u-s-security-cooperation-with-ukraine)
 about $66.2 billion in [security assistance](https://media.defense.gov/2025/Jan/09/2003626079/-1/-1/1/KEY-ACHIEVEMENTS-AND-FACTS-US-SECURITY-ASSISTANCE-TO-UKRAINE.PDF)
 between 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea, and February 2022 when Moscow launched a war, and about $66.5 billion since.

Lavrov’s claim that by aiding Ukraine the U.S. society, in part due to the [Russian propaganda influence](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/07/nx-s1-5101895/doj-says-russia-paid-right-wing-influencers-to-spread-russian-propaganda)
.

Experts, however, argue that opposite to draining American economy, the large portion of the Ukraine aid is being reinvested domestically, [boosting defense manufacturing industry and sustaining jobs](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/blog-post/us-aid-ukraine-helps-american-economy-and-boosts-us-jobs)
.

Russian propaganda exploited the Ukrainian angle in the Los Angeles fires trying to spread false accusations against Ukraine’s military command of misappropriating the Western aid.

Russia’s newly emerged group of social media influencers nicknamed “milbloggers” as most members are either Russian combatants or pro-war reporters from the battle lines in Ukraine, played key role in creating and spreading such false claims.

Russian Telegram channel Voennyj obozrevatel' (Military Observer) alleged on January 11, that eight mansions worth a total of $90 million owned by high-ranking Ukrainian military officials, were destroyed in the Los Angeles wildfires.

“According to Ukrainian sources, 8 mansions owned by high-ranking Ukrainian military personnel were burned during large-scale wildfires in Los Angeles. The total value of these properties amounts to $90 million and was allegedly purchased with funds provided by the West as part of economic aid to Kyiv after the war began.”

Russian state-controlled news sites and media outlets, including Gazeta.ru, Lenta.ru, EADaily, News.ru, Komsomolskaya Pravda, Tsargrad, and Rossiyskaya Gazeta used the post in their news coverage.

[Multiple fact-checking outlets](https://www.factchecker.gr/2025/01/12/russian-propaganda-8-mansions-of-high-ranking-ukrainian-military-officials-did-not-burn-down-in-los-angeles/)
 and even some Russian news media debunked the post as lacking merit and unsubstantiated.

Yet the claim about the luxury villas of Ukrainian generals allegedly burning down in Los Angeles spread on X the following days, receiving millions of views and thousands of reposts.

In another disinformation plot, on January 13-14, Russian state-owned news sites sought to undermine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's decision to send Ukrainian firefighters to Los Angeles to help put out the wildfires.

State-owned RIA Novosti, RT, and others used an X post by “Ukrainian journalist” Diana Panchenko, who wrote responding to Zeleskyy’s announcement: "I am glad that hundreds of men will have the opportunity to leave Ukraine these days."

Russian news outlets generalized the post, speculating it signaled that Ukrainian journalists oppose Ukraine's fight for independence and the Ukrainian men are desperate to leave the country.

In fact, Reporters Without Borders exposed [Diana Panchenko as Russian propagandist](https://rsf.org/en/diana-panchenko-ukrainian-propagandist-working-kremlin)

The evidence suggests that Russia used the wildfires to criticize the U.S. and promote anti-Ukraine narratives. However, there is still no mention of Russia offering any form of assistance.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The fact-check reveals that Russia commented on the California wildfires in January 2025, with some officials criticizing the U.S. and offering sanctuary to fire victims under specific conditions. However, the search results do not provide any evidence of Russia offering assistance for the California wildfires.

Given the lack of evidence supporting the claim that Russia offered assistance, the most appropriate decision option is `not enough information`.

Last week, devastating wildfires ignited across Los Angeles County in what is one of the most destructive natural disasters in US history. But as firefighters continue to battle the flames, false and misleading information about the disaster [has spread](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/10/rightwing-misinformation-los-angeles-fire)
 just as quickly on social media. While much of the false information seemingly originated from users in the United States, Russian state-affiliated accounts also leveraged the California wildfires and narratives reverberating among certain segments of the US public to sow division, undermine trust in relief efforts, and reduce public support for Ukraine.  

**Diverting Resources to Ukraine** 

Amid the destructive wildfires in Los Angeles, Russian government officials and state-affiliated media have propagated narratives critical of the Biden administration and other Democratic leaders to aggravate political division, particularly on Ukraine, and to denigrate the United States. Russian-state controlled outlet Sputnik further [mocked](https://x.com/Sputnik_India/status/1879127371049001320)
 Biden’s emergency relief payments to victims of the wildfires, claiming that they receive less daily per capita than people in Ukraine and Israel.  

Russian state-controlled media outlets further [honed in](https://sputnikglobe.com/20250109/california-wildfires-unexpected-links-to-us-green-lobby-and-ukraine-1121391704.html)
 [on reports](https://x.com/SputnikInt/status/1877282105815597399)
 that the Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) donated surplus equipment to Ukraine in 2022 [to suggest](https://x.com/SputnikInt/status/1877345987468882396)
 that those donations [created a lack of](https://x.com/RT_com/status/1877126472915128820)
 resources to fight fires. Additionally, Russian state media seized on the fires to fuel divides on other partisan policy issues, linking the fires to the “[green lobby](https://sputnikglobe.com/20250109/california-wildfires-unexpected-links-to-us-green-lobby-and-ukraine-1121391704.html)
” and [blaming](https://x.com/RT_com/status/1877151147703562608)
 the firefighter shortage on COVID-19 vaccine mandates.

**Amplifying** **AI-Generated Content**

In at least one case, Russian state media amplified a misleading image generated by artificial intelligence (AI). Other Russian-language media outlets subsequently spread the image. 

**Conclusion** 

Kremlin-affiliated accounts have leveraged the California wildfires to further advance Russia’s geopolitical agenda. In a press conference on January 14, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov [claimed](https://x.com/SputnikInt/status/1879100711361016212)
 the estimated $250 billion worth of damage sustained from the California fires is comparable to the amount Washington “pumped into Ukraine”. Russia’s messaging on the wildfires further underlines a trend of autocratic states [exploiting natural disasters](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/investigations/russia-china-cuba-amplified-falsehoods-recent-hurricanes-us-official-s-rcna177672)
 to advance their geopolitical goals. This approach keeps with Russia’s now [longstanding strategy](https://securingdemocracy.gmfus.org/a-year-of-disinformation-russia-and-chinas-influence-campaigns-during-the-war-in-ukraine/)
 to dent US support for Ukraine by playing to pocketbook issues and perceptions that domestic issues have received less attention than foreign ones. 

![](/sites/default/files/inline-images/rt%201.png)

**Blaming DEI**

Accounts affiliated with Russia echoed narratives prominent among American audiences that claim diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives hindered wildfire recovery efforts. Russian state-controlled media outlet RT [accused](https://x.com/RT_com/status/1876870822637248582)
 LAFD Chief Kristen Crowly—the first woman and openly gay person to serve in the role—of prioritizing DEI initiatives at the expense of preventing fires. Sputnik also [posted](https://x.com/SputnikInt/status/1877278684240859332)
 a local news clip of a California resident who claimed that “gay people” were the cause of the fires."

The article also mentions that Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov claimed the damage from the California fires was comparable to the amount Washington "pumped into Ukraine." The article does not mention any offers of assistance from Russia.


## Elaboration
The evidence consistently shows that Russia commented on the California wildfires and used them to criticize the U.S. and promote anti-Ukraine narratives. However, none of the provided sources mention Russia offering any form of assistance for the wildfires.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Tasnim News Agency published an article on January 12, 2025, discussing Russia's comments on the California wildfires, including comments from Maria Zakharova. The article mentions that wildfires began to spread across Los Angeles County on January 7. ([https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2025/01/12/3236714/russia-notes-us-hypocrisy-in-california-fire-case](https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2025/01/12/3236714/russia-notes-us-hypocrisy-in-california-fire-case)) <image:4830>, <image:4831>

The Dispatch published an article on January 15, 2025, discussing claims that Russia offered sanctuary to California fire victims. Vladimir Saldo offered to accept Americans who lost their homes in the California fires, but only those who haven't supported Ukraine since February 2022. ([https://thedispatch.com/article/assessing-claims-that-russia-offered-sanctuary-to-california-fire-victims/](https://thedispatch.com/article/assessing-claims-that-russia-offered-sanctuary-to-california-fire-victims/)) <image:4838>

An NPR article, published on January 16, 2025, discusses how pro-Kremlin social media accounts spread a narrative about the Los Angeles wildfires. The article states that Russian news sites are spreading false or unverified narratives about the California fires. ([https://www.npr.org/2025/01/16/nx-s1-5259842/los-angeles-california-fires-russia-ukraine](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/16/nx-s1-5259842/los-angeles-california-fires-russia-ukraine)) <image:4849>, <image:4853>


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Russia commented on the California wildfires and that Vladimir Saldo offered sanctuary to fire victims. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Russia offered assistance for the California wildfires.

The NPR article suggests that Russian news sites spread false or unverified narratives about the fires. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence.

To verify the claim, information about any specific offers of assistance from Russia would be needed.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-exploits-wildfires-in-los-angeles-to-push-anti-u-s-anti-ukraine-propaganda/7938909.html): 
Content: Voice of America published an article on January 16, 2025, discussing how Russia exploited the Los Angeles wildfires to push anti-US and anti-Ukraine propaganda. The article mentions Maria Zakharova, who accused the U.S. of hypocrisy regarding the use of inmate firefighters. The article also mentions that Lavrov claimed the damage from the fires was comparable to the U.S. aid to Ukraine. <image:13678>


## Elaboration
The new evidence from Voice of America ([https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-exploits-wildfires-in-los-angeles-to-push-anti-u-s-anti-ukraine-propaganda/7938909.html](https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-exploits-wildfires-in-los-angeles-to-push-anti-u-s-anti-ukraine-propaganda/7938909.html)) does not mention any offers of assistance from Russia. Instead, it focuses on Russia's exploitation of the wildfires for propaganda purposes.

The evidence suggests that Russia used the wildfires to criticize the U.S. and promote anti-Ukraine narratives. However, there is still no mention of Russia offering any form of assistance.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified.

Senate Leaders Finalize Committee Assignments for the 119th Congress
====================================================================

[Back to Blog](https://www.acec.org/news/blog-last-word/)

![Washington DC, US Capitol Building](https://www.acec.org/wp-content/uploads/bb-plugin/cache/AdobeStock_904736501-1200x800-landscape-6c888ef13f0fe19ac1b3fb6c4a765b28-ra284zgqv9t1.jpeg "Washington DC, US Capitol Building")

Senate Republican Leader John Thune (R-SD) and Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) have announced committee assignments for the new Congress, including appointments for newly elected members.

On the Finance Committee, which will take the lead in crafting an extension and modification of the 2017 tax law, Senator Roger Marshall (R-KS) is the only new Republican addition to this key committee. He will be joined by fellow freshmen senators Adam Schiff (D-CA), Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-DE), and Angela Alsobrooks (D-MD).

The Commerce, Science, & Transportation Committee, with responsibility for aviation and surface transportation policy, will include Senators Bernie Moreno (R-OH), Tim Sheehy (R-MT), and Curtis. There was significant turnover on the Democratic side, with senators Sanders (I-VT), Smith (D-MN), Lujan (D-NM), Warnock (D-GA), and Welch (D-VT) replacing departing members.

Newly elected John Curtis (R-UT) will be joining the Environment & Public Works Committee, which has jurisdiction over federal highway, water, and environmental infrastructure programs. On the Democratic side, the committee adds newly elected senators Andy Kim (D-NJ) and Blunt Rochester.

Senators Jim Justice (R-WV) and Dave McCormack (R-PA) will join the Energy Committee on the majority side, along with Senator Ruben Gallego (D-AZ) on the minority.

Content: "Eric Swalwell and Adam Schiff, the former chairman of the panel.

The decision reflects the increasingly politicized nature of one of Congress’ most important national security committees and was swiftly met with outrage by the two California Democrats, both of whom played key roles in the impeachments of former President Donald Trump.

“I cannot put partisan loyalty ahead of national security, and I cannot simply recognize years of service as the sole criteria for membership on this essential committee. Integrity matters more,” McCarthy wrote in a letter to House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries that he [posted on Twitter](https://twitter.com/SpeakerMcCarthy/status/1618047779422769154?s=20&t=d-aUU6NhKX5LawVEJvU2nA)
 Tuesday night.

McCarthy has cited a “new standard” from Democrats for why he would strip Schiff and Swalwell, both of California, of their committee assignments. [](#maincontent)

![Sen. “It’s too bad because that committee has always been a bipartisan committee, and he’s taking one of the most precious pieces of glassware in the congressional cabinet and smashing it, and the damage is going to be irreparable.”

He added that “if a Democrat advocated for violence against another member of Congress, I would support getting rid of them.”

Schiff told reporters that “if McCarthy thinks this is going to stop me from vigorously pushing back against his efforts to tear down these institutions, he’s going to find out just how wrong he is.”

“I think this is a terrible move on his part and once again, showing McCarthy just catering to the most extreme elements of this conference,” he added.

Schiff will sit on the Judiciary Committee, according to a Democratic aide, while Swalwell told CNN he will sit on the Judiciary and Homeland Security panels.

Some House Republicans have criticized McCarthy’s move ejecting Democrats from the intelligence panel. Indeed, the opposition to it is bipartisan.”

The three Democrats whom McCarthy ousted or plan to oust stood in unity at a Capitol Hill news conference Wednesday.

“The three of us have chosen to stick together because this isn’t about any individual committee assignments, and this is about an institution where the speaker of the House is using his power to go after his political opponents, and to pick them off the field,” Swalwell said.

They all seemed in agreement that the “destructive move” was especially hypocritical, given embattled Rep. He’s perfectly comfortable with it,” Schiff said.

Members appointed to select subcommittees

McCarthy on Tuesday also announced the list of GOP members he is appointing to serve on the select subcommittee on the weaponization of the federal government, with Ohio GOP Rep. ](https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c-gettyimages-2204254022.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_250,c_fill)

In the letter, McCarthy added that “it is my assessment that the misuse of this panel during the 116th and 117th Congresses severely undermined its primary national security and oversight missions – ultimately leaving our nation less safe,” and that he wants the panel to be one of “genuine honesty and credibility that regains the trust of the American people.”

‘Political vengeance’
---------------------

“It’s political vengeance,” Swalwell said following the decision on Tuesday. Victoria Spartz of Indiana said in a statement that she opposes the push to remove the Democrats.

“I appreciate these Republican members speaking out against what McCarthy is doing,” Schiff later told CNN’s Anderson Cooper on “AC360.”

“I think it does show that there are Republicans who understand this is very ill considered."

The move comes as the new Republican majority is outlining its plans and priorities for the session, which include a focus on oversight and investigations of President Biden's administration.

As House speaker, McCarthy has authority to approve or reject spots on the intelligence committee because it is a "select" committee, while positions on standing committees ultimately require a vote of the House. 6 attack on the Capitol.

In [a letter to Jeffries](https://twitter.com/SpeakerMcCarthy/status/1618047779422769154)
, McCarthy said the intel committee under Schiff "severely undermined its primary national security and oversight missions — ultimately leaving our nation less safe."

### Schiff told reporters Tuesday he thinks the move is purely political

While McCarthy argues blocking Schiff and Swalwell is in the interest of national security, Democrats say the move is nothing more than political retribution.

"His objection seems to be that I was the lead impeachment manager in Donald Trump's first impeachment, and that we held him accountable for withholding hundreds of millions of dollars of military aid from Ukraine," Schiff said. "So he is now, I think, carrying the dirty water for the former president in trying to remove me from the intel committee."

But, Schiff added, "if McCarthy thinks this is going to stop me from holding him accountable, holding Donald Trump accountable or any of the extreme elements of his conference, he's wrong."

Schiff is now slated to serve on the House Judiciary Committee, according to a source familiar with the discussions but unauthorized to speak publicly.

Schiff, the former Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and the lead prosecutor in Trump’s first impeachment trial, has long been a top Republican political target. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida, removed a provision that could have fined Schiff $16 million if the House Ethics Committee determined he lied. Both investigations concluded that Russia intervened in the 2016 presidential election but neither found evidence of a criminal conspiracy.

“Representative Schiff purposely deceived his Committee, Congress, and the American people,” the resolution said.

The House has only censured two other lawmakers in the last 20 years. But the GOP resolution would also launch an ethics investigation into Schiff’s conduct.

While Schiff did not initiate the 2017 congressional investigation into Trump’s Russia ties — then-House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, a Republican who later became one of Trump’s most ardent defenders, started it — Republicans arguing in favor of his censure Wednesday blamed him for what they said was the fallout of that probe, and of the separate investigation started that same year by Trump’s own Justice Department.

Luna said that Schiff’s comments that there was evidence against Trump “ripped apart American families across the country” and that he was “permanently destroying family relationships.” Several blamed him for the more than $30 million spent by then-special counsel Robert Mueller, who led the Justice Department probe.

Schiff said the censure resolution “would accuse me of omnipotence, the leader of some a vast Deep State conspiracy, and of course, it is nonsense.”

Democrats aggressively defended their colleague. Adam Schiff calls Trump’s election lie a ‘dangerous cancer’](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-rep-adam-schiff-calls-trumps-election-lie-a-dangerous-cancer)

Mueller, who led the two-year Justice Department investigation, determined that Russia intervened on the campaign’s behalf and that Trump’s campaign welcomed the help. Schiff was the lead House prosecutor making the case for conviction to the Senate, arguing repeatedly that “right matters.” The Republican-led chamber ultimately acquitted him.

[**WATCH:** McCarthy says he’ll block Schiff, Swalwell from House intelligence committee](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-mccarthy-says-hell-block-schiff-swalwell-from-house-intelligence-committee)

Trump was impeached a second time a year later, after he had left office, for his role in the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the Capitol. The Senate again acquitted Trump.

In the censure resolution against Schiff, Luna also cited a report released in May from special counsel John Durham that found that the FBI rushed into its investigation of Trump’s campaign and relied too much on raw and unconfirmed intelligence.

Durham — who testified before the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday — said investigators repeatedly relied on “confirmation bias,” ignoring or rationalizing away evidence that undercut their premise of a Trump-Russia conspiracy as they pushed the probe forward."

Given names
-----------

East Slavic parents select a [given name](/wiki/Russian_personal_name "Russian personal name")
 for a newborn child. Most first names in East Slavic languages originate from two sources:

*   [Eastern Orthodox Church](/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church "Eastern Orthodox Church")
     tradition
*   [native pre-Christian Slavic lexicons](/wiki/Slavic_names "Slavic names")
    

Almost all first names are single. Doubled first names (as in, for example, [French](/wiki/French_name "French name")
, like _Jean-Luc_) are very rare and are from foreign influence. Most doubled first names are written with a hyphen: _Mariya-Tereza_.

### Forms

Being highly [synthetic languages](/wiki/Synthetic_languages "Synthetic languages")
, the East Slavic ones treat personal names as [grammatical](/wiki/Grammatical "Grammatical")
 nouns and apply the same rules of [inflection](/wiki/Inflection "Inflection")
 and [derivation](/wiki/Derivation_(linguistics) "Derivation (linguistics)")
 to them as for other nouns. So one can create many forms with different degrees of affection and familiarity by adding the corresponding suffixes to the auxiliary stem derived from the original name. The auxiliary stem may be identical to the word stem of the full name (the full name Жанна _Zhanna_ can have the suffixes added directly to the stem Жанн- _Zhann-_ like Жанн**очка** _Zhann**ochka**_), and most names have the auxiliary stem derived unproductively (the Russian name Михаил _Mikhail_ has the auxiliary stem Миш- _Mish-_, which produces such name-forms as Миш**а** _Mish**a**_, Миш**енька** _Mish**enka**_, Миш**уня** _Mish**unya**_ etc., not \***Михаил**ушка _**Mikhail**ushka_).

Unlike English, in which the use of diminutive forms is optional even between close friends, in East Slavonic languages, such forms are obligatory in certain contexts because of the strong [T–V distinction](/wiki/T%E2%80%93V_distinction "T–V distinction")
: the T-form of address usually requires the short form of the counterpart's name. Also, unlike other languages with prominent use of name suffixes, such as Japanese, the use of derived name forms is mostly limited to the T-addressing: there is no way to make the name more formal than the plain unsuffixed full form, and usually no suffixes can be added to the family name.

Most commonly, Russian philologists distinguish the following forms of given names:

| Name form | Example | Formation | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Full | _Анна_ (Anna) | full name stem + case ending | \-  |
| Short | _Ан**я**_ (An**ya**) | short name stem + II declension ending | most common for informal communication, comparable to Western name-only form of address _(Ann, John)_, or Japanese surname-only, or _surname/name -kun_ |
| Diminutive | _Ань**к**а_ (An**k**a) | short name stem + -к- _\-k-_ + II declension ending | expresses familiarity, may be considered rude when used between people who are not close friends. Comparable to English diminutives _(Annie, Willy)_ or Japanese unsuffixed names |
| Affective diminutive | _Ан**ечк**а_ (An**yechk**a) | short name stem + -ечк/очк/оньк/усь/юсь/уль/юль- _\-echk/ochk/on'k/us/yus/ul/yul-_ + II declension ending | most intimate and affectionate form, comparable to German diminutives _(Ännchen)_ or Japanese _\-chan_ suffixes |

#### Short forms

[Marina Tsvetaeva](/wiki/Marina_Tsvetaeva "Marina Tsvetaeva")
, a Russian poet. The name "Marina" traditionally has no short form.

_Руслан_ (Ruslan), a character in [Alexander Pushkin](/wiki/Alexander_Pushkin "Alexander Pushkin")
's poem _[Ruslan and Ludmila](/wiki/Ruslan_and_Ludmila "Ruslan and Ludmila")
_. The short form for _Руслан_ (Ruslan) is _Руся_ (Rusya).

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Mikola_II.jpg/250px-Mikola_II.jpg)](/wiki/File:Mikola_II.jpg)

Николай II ([Nicholas II](/wiki/Nicholas_II "Nicholas II")
), the last Russian emperor. In private, [his wife](/wiki/Alexandra_Feodorovna_(Alix_of_Hesse) "Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)")
 addressed him as Nicki, in the German manner, rather than _Коля_ (Kolya), which is the East Slavic short form of his name.

The "short name" (Russian: краткое имя _kratkoye imya_), historically also "half-name" (Russian: полуимя _poluimya_), is the simplest and most common name derivative. Bearing no suffix, it is produced [suppletively](/wiki/Suppletion "Suppletion")
 and always has the declension noun ending for both males and females, thus making short forms of certain unisex names indistinguishable: for example, Sasha (Russian: Саша) is the short name for both the masculine name Aleksandr (Alexander) and the feminine form Aleksandra (Alexandra).

Some names, such as Zhanna (Jeana) and Mark, have no short forms; others may have two (or more) different forms. In the latter case, one form is usually more informal than the other.

#### Diminutive forms

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Veruschka_Gr%C3%A4fin_von_Lehndorff_001.jpg/250px-Veruschka_Gr%C3%A4fin_von_Lehndorff_001.jpg)](/wiki/File:Veruschka_Gr%C3%A4fin_von_Lehndorff_001.jpg)

[Veruschka](/wiki/Veruschka "Veruschka")
, a German model, actress and artist. "Veruschka" is the German spelling the [hypocoristic](/wiki/Hypocoristic "Hypocoristic")
 Верушка of her given name [Vera](/wiki/Vera_(given_name) "Vera (given name)")
.

Diminutive forms are produced from the "short name" by means of various suffixes; for example, Михаил Mikhail (full) – Миша Misha (short) – Мишенька Mishenka (affectionate) – Мишка Mishka (colloquial). If no "short name" exists, then diminutive forms are produced from the full form of the respective first name; for example, Марина Marina (full) – Мариночка Marinochka (affectionate) – Маринка Marinka (colloquial). Unlike the full name, a diminutive name carries a particular emotional attitude and may be unacceptable in certain contexts. Depending on the nature of the attitude, diminutive name forms can be subdivided into three broad groups: affectionate, familiar, and slang.

##### Affectionate diminutive

Typically formed by suffixes -_еньк_\- (-yenk-), -_оньк_\- (-onk-), -_ечк_\- (-yechk-), -_ушк_ (-ushk), as illustrated by the examples below. It generally emphasises a tender, affectionate attitude and is roughly analogous to German suffixes -_chen_, -_lein_, Japanese -_chan_ and -_tan_ and affectionate name-derived nicknames in other languages. It is often used to address children or intimate friends.

Within a more official context, this form may be combined with the honorific plural to address a younger female colleague.\[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")\

| Ольга/Olga | Оля/Olya | Оленька/Olyenka |
| Степан/Stepan | Стёпа/Styopa | Стёпочка/Styopochka |

##### Colloquial diminutives

Colloquial diminutives are derived from short names by the -_к_\- ("-k-") suffix. Expressing a highly familiar attitude, the use may be considered rude or even pejorative outside a friendly context.

\], _Real Lads_). Kolyan shows viewers the ridiculous side of the life of [gopniks](/wiki/Gopnik "Gopnik")
, a subculture similar to British [chavs](/wiki/Chav "Chav")
.

Slang forms exist for male names and, since a few decades ago, female names. They are formed with the suffixes -_ян_ (-yan), -_он_ (-on), and -_ок/ёк_ (-ok/yok). The suffixes give the sense of "male brotherhood" that was once expressed by the patronymic-only form of address in the Soviet Union.

During the days of the [October Revolution](/wiki/October_Revolution "October Revolution")
, as part of the campaign to rid Russia of [bourgeois](/wiki/Bourgeoisie "Bourgeoisie")
 culture, there was a drive to invent new, revolutionary names. As a result, many Soviet children were given atypical names, often being [acronyms](/wiki/Acronyms "Acronyms")

Patronymics
-----------

The patronymic name is based on the given name of the father and is written in all legal and identity documents. If used with the given name, the patronymic always follows it; but it is not analogous to an English [middle name](/wiki/Middle_name "Middle name")
.

### Usage

The patronymic name is obligatory when addressing a person of higher social stance and/or on special occasions such as business meetings; for example, when a pupil addresses a teacher, they are obliged to use both first and patronymic names – [Russian](/wiki/Russian_language "Russian language")
: Марья Ивановна, могу я спросить..., [lit.](/wiki/Literal_translation "Literal translation") 'Marya Ivanovna, may I ask...'. Not using patronymic names in such situations is considered offensive.[\[2\]](#cite_note-3)

Addressing a person by patronymic name only is widespread among older generations and serves as a display of close relationship based on not only sympathy but also mutual responsibility.[\[3\]](#cite_note-4)

In speech patronymics are commonly truncated and it is not considered to be a colloquialism, e.g., written "Ivan Ivanovich" may be pronounced "as is", as well as "Ivan Ivanych".[\[4\]](#cite_note-5)
[\[5\]](#cite_note-6)

In the past of [East Slavs](/wiki/East_Slavs "East Slavs")
, before the introduction of surnames, noble, wealthy, or otherwise respected people were addressed by name plus patronymic, see, e.g., "[Yaroslavich](/wiki/Yaroslavich "Yaroslavich")
"/"[Yaroslavna](/wiki/Yaroslavna "Yaroslavna")
". From this custom a number of surnames of [West Ruthenian](/wiki/Ruthenians "Ruthenians")
 origin was produced, such as [Antonovich](/wiki/Antonovich "Antonovich")
 or [Prokopovich](/wiki/Prokopovich "Prokopovich")
, which in their turn derived [Polish surnames](/wiki/Polish_surnames "Polish surnames")
, such as [Antonowicz](/wiki/Antonowicz "Antonowicz")
 or [Prokopowicz](/wiki/Prokopowicz "Prokopowicz")
 (the Ruthenian origin is recognized by the suffix _\-wicz_: the corresponding native (now archaic) Polish suffix was '-wic': [Szymonowic](/wiki/Szymonowic "Szymonowic")
, [Klonowic](/wiki/Klonowic "Klonowic")
).[\[6\]](#cite_note-7)

For commoners, when the distinction among people with the same given name was required, a qualifier "son of..." was usually added: "Ивашка, Антонов сын" ("Ivashka, Antonov syn", i.e., 'Ivashka, son of Anton'). From the latter tradition Russian [patronymic surnames](/wiki/Patronymic_surname "Patronymic surname")
 ending in "-ov/-ev/yov" originated, in this case, [Antonov](/wiki/Antonov_(surname) "Antonov (surname)")
".

### Derivation

| Name | Masculine patronym | Feminine patronym |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Anatoly | Anatolyevich | Anatolyevna |
| Constantin | Constantinovich | Constantinovna |
| Dmitry | Dmitriyevich | Dmitriyevna |
| Ilya | Ilyich | Ilyinichna |
| Ivan | Ivanovich | Ivanovna |
| Nikolay | Nikolayevich | Nikolayevna |
| Vladimir | Vladimirovich | Vladimirovna |
| Yakov | Yakovlevich | Yakovlevna |

The patronymic is formed by a combination of the father's name and suffixes. The suffix is -_ович_ (-ovich) for a son, -_овна_ (-ovna) – for a daughter. For example, if the father's name was _Иван_ (Ivan), the patronymic will be _Иванович_ (Ivanovich) for a son and _Ивановна_ (Ivanovna) for a daughter.

If the suffix is being appended to a name ending in a _й_ ("y") or a soft [consonant](/wiki/Consonant "Consonant")
, the initial _o_ in the suffixes -_ович_ (-ovich) and -_овна_ (-ovna) becomes a _е_ ("ye") and the suffixes change to -_евич_ (-yevich) and -_евна_ (-yevna). For example, if the father is _Дмитрий_ (Dmitry), the patronymic is _Дмитриевич_ (Dmitrievich) for a son and _Дмитриевна_ (Dmitrievna) for a daughter. It is not _Дмитрович_ (Dmitrovich) or _Дмитровна_ (Dmitrovna) because the name _Дмитрий_ (Dmitry) ends on "й" ("y");

For some names ending in a [vowel](/wiki/Vowel "Vowel")
, the suffix is -_ич_ (-ich) for a son and -_ична_ (-ichna) or -_инична_ (-inichna) for a daughter; for example, Фока Foka (father's first name) – Фокич Fokich (male patronymic) – Фокична Fokichna (female patronymic); Кузьма Kuzma (father's first name) – Кузьмич Kuzmich (male patronymic) – Кузьминична Kuzminichna (female patronymic).

### Historical grounds

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Rurikname.JPG/250px-Rurikname.JPG)](/wiki/File:Rurikname.JPG)

The name [Rurik](/wiki/Rurik "Rurik")
 on a [Viking Age](/wiki/Viking_Age "Viking Age")
 runestone. All the princes of [Kievan Rus](/wiki/Kievan_Rus "Kievan Rus")
 had the patronymic [Ruerikovichi](/wiki/Rurikids "Rurikids")
.

Historical Russian naming conventions did not include surnames. A person's name included that of their father: e.g. _Иван Петров сын_ (Ivan Petrov syn) which means "Ivan, son of Peter". That is the origin of most Russian -ov surnames.

Modern -ovich- patronyms were originally a feature of the royal dynasty (Рюрико**вич**и, [Rueriko**vich**i, Rurikids](/wiki/Rurik_dynasty "Rurik dynasty")
, which makes the East Slavic patronym in its original meaning being similar to German _von_. From the 17th century, the second name with suffix -_ович_ (-_ovich_) was the privilege given by the [tsar](/wiki/Tsar "Tsar")
 to commoners. For example, in 1610, Tsar [Vasili IV](/wiki/Vasili_IV_of_Russia "Vasili IV of Russia")
 gave to the [Stroganovs](/wiki/Stroganov_family "Stroganov family")
, who were merchants, the privilege to use patronyms. As a tribute for developing the salt industry in Siberia, Pyotr Stroganov and all his issues were allowed to have a name with -_ovich_. The tsar wrote in the chart dated on 29 May, "... _to write him with_ ovich_, to try_ \[him\] _in Moscow only, not to fee_ \[him\] _by other fees, not to kiss a cross by himself_ \[which means not to swear during any processions\]"[\[7\]](#cite_note-8)
 In the 18th century, it was the family of merchants to have patronyms. By the 19th century, the -ovich form eventually became the default form of a patronymic.

### Legal basis

Everyone in Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus is supposed to have a tripartite name. Single mothers may give their children any patronym, and this does not have any legal consequences. Foreigners who adopt Russian citizenship are exempted from having a patronym. Now, an adult person is entitled to change patronyms if necessary,[\[8\]](#cite_note-9)
 such as to alienate themselves from the biological father (or to show respect for the adopted one) as well as to decide the same for an underage child.

### Matronymic

In modern Russia, there are cases when women raising a child without a father give the child their own name instead of a patronymic. This practice is not recognized by law, but the civil registry offices may meet such wishes. A common loophole is when mother's name is a feminine form of a masculine given name, even an obscure one.[\[9\]](#cite_note-10)
[\[10\]](#cite_note-11)

Family names
------------

[Family names](/wiki/Family_name "Family name")
 are generally used like in English.

In Russian, some common suffixes are -_ов_ (-ov), -_ев_ (-yev), meaning "belonging to" or "of the clan of/descendant of", e.g. Petrov = of the clan of/descendant of Petr (Peter), usually used for [patronymic surnames](/wiki/Patronymic_surname "Patronymic surname")
—or -_ский_ (-sky), an adjectival form, meaning "associated with" and usually used for [toponymic surnames](/wiki/Toponymic_surname "Toponymic surname")
. Historically, toponymic surnames may have been granted as a token of nobility; for example, the princely surname [Shuysky](/wiki/Shuysky "Shuysky")
 is indicative of the princedom based on the ownership of [Shuya](/wiki/Shuya_(inhabited_locality) "Shuya (inhabited locality)")
. Prince [Grigory Aleksandrovich Potemkin](/wiki/Grigory_Potemkin "Grigory Potemkin")
\-Tavricheski had the [victory title](/wiki/Victory_title "Victory title")
 'Tavricheski', as part of his surname, granted to him for the [annexation of Crimea by the Russian Empire](/wiki/Annexation_of_Crimea_by_the_Russian_Empire "Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Empire")
.

In the 19th and early 20th centuries, _\-off_ was a common transliteration of _\-ov_ for Russian family names in foreign languages such as French and German (like for the [Smirnoff](/wiki/Smirnoff "Smirnoff")
 and the [Davidoff](/wiki/Davidoff "Davidoff")
 brands).

Surnames of Ukrainian and Belarusian origin use the suffixes -ко (-ko), -ук (-uk), and -ич (-ych). For example, the family name _Писаренко_ ([Pisarenko](/wiki/Pisarenko "Pisarenko")
) is derived from the word for a scribe, and _Ковальчук_ ([Kovalchuk](/wiki/Kovalchuk "Kovalchuk")
) refers to a smith.

Less often, some versions of family names will have no suffix, e.g. Lebed, meaning swan, and Zhuk, meaning beetle (but see also Lebedev and Zhukov).

[Hyphenated surnames](/wiki/Hyphenated_surname "Hyphenated surname")
 like [Petrov-Vodkin](/wiki/Petrov-Vodkin "Petrov-Vodkin")
 are possible.

### Grammar

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Lesser_CoA_of_the_emperor_of_Russia.svg/250px-Lesser_CoA_of_the_emperor_of_Russia.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Lesser_CoA_of_the_emperor_of_Russia.svg)

The Coat of Arms of the _Романовы_ ([Romanovs](/wiki/Romanovs "Romanovs")
), the last Russian royal dynasty. The family name _Романов_ (Romanov) means "pertaining to (the name) Roman".

East Slavic languages are [synthetic languages](/wiki/Synthetic_languages "Synthetic languages")
 and have [grammatical cases](/wiki/Grammatical_cases "Grammatical cases")
 and [grammatical gender](/wiki/Grammatical_gender "Grammatical gender")
. Unlike [analytic languages](/wiki/Analytic_language "Analytic language")
 like English, which use prepositions ("to", "at", "on" etc.) to show the links and relations between words in a sentence, East Slavic suffixes are used much more broadly than prepositions. Words need the help of some suffix to integrate them into the sentence and to build a grammatically correct sentence. That includes names, unlike in German. Family names are declined based on the Slavic case system.

The surnames that originally are short (_\-ov_, _\-ev_, _\-in_) or full (_\-iy/-oy/-yy_) Slavic adjectives, have different forms depending on gender: male forms _\-ov_, _\-ev_, _\-in_ and _\-iy/-oy/-yy_ correspond to female forms _\-ova_, _\-eva_, _\-ina_ and _\-aya_, respectively. For example, the wife of _Борис Ельцин_ (Boris Yel'tsin) was _Наина Ельцин**а**_ (Naina Yel'tsin**a**); the wife of [Leo Tolst**oy**](/wiki/Leo_Tolstoy "Leo Tolstoy")
 was [Sophia Tolst**aya**](/wiki/Sophia_Tolstaya "Sophia Tolstaya")
, etc. All other, i.e. non-adjectival, surnames stay the same for both genders (including surnames ending with -_енко_ (_\-yenko_), -_ич_ (_\-ich_) etc.), unlike in many [West Slavic languages](/wiki/West_Slavic_languages "West Slavic languages")
, where the non-adjectival surname of men corresponds to derivative feminine adjectival surname (Novák → Nováková). Note the difference between patronymics and surnames ending with _\-ich_: surnames are the same for males and females, but patronymics are gender-dependent (for example, Ivan Petrov_ich_ Mirov_ich_ and Anna Petr_ovna_ Mirov_ich_)

This dependence of [grammatical gender](/wiki/Grammatical_gender "Grammatical gender")
 of adjectival surname on the gender of its owner is not considered to be changing the surname (compare the equivalent rule in [Polish](/wiki/Polish_name "Polish name")
, for example). The correct transliteration of such feminine surnames in English is debated: the names technically should be in their original form, but they sometimes appear in the masculine form.

The example of _Иванов_ (Ivanov), a family name, will be used:

| Grammatical  <br>case | Example of question | Masculine form |     | Feminine form |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cyrillic | Latin | Cyrillic | Latin |
| [Nominative](/wiki/Nominative_case "Nominative case") | Who? | _Иванов_ | Ivanov | _Иванова_ | Ivanova |
| [Genitive](/wiki/Genitive_case "Genitive case") | Whose? | _Ивано**ва**_ | Ivano**va** | _Ивано**вой**_ | Ivano**voy** |
| [Dative](/wiki/Dative_case "Dative case") | To whom? | _Ивано**ву**_ | Ivano**vu** | _Ивано**вой**_ | Ivano**voy** |
| [Accusative](/wiki/Accusative_case "Accusative case") | Whom? | _Ивано**ва**_ | Ivano**va** | _Ивано**ву**_ | Ivano**vu** |
| [Instrumental](/wiki/Instrumental_case "Instrumental case") | By whom? | _Ивано**вым**_ | Ivano**vym** | _Ивано**вой**_ | Ivano**voy** |
| [Locative](/wiki/Locative_case "Locative case")<br> (Prepositional) | About whom? | _Ивано**ве**_ | Ivano**ve** | _Ивано**вой**_ | Ivano**voy** |

The surnames which are not grammatically adjectives (_Zhuk_, _Gogol_, _Barchuk_, _Kupala_ etc.) declines in cases and numbers as the corresponding common noun. The exclusion is when a woman has a surname which is grammatically a noun of masculine gender; in such case, the surname is not declined. For example, Ivan and Anna Zhuk in dative case ("to whom?") would be: Иван**у** Жук**у** (_Ivan**u**_ _Zhuk**u**_), but Анн**е** Жук (_Ann**e** Zhuk_).

Family names are generally inherited from one's parents. As in English, on marriage, women usually adopt the surname of the husband; the opposite, when the husband adopt the maiden surname of his wife, very rarely occurs. Rarely, both spouses keep their pre-marriage family names. The fourth, very rare but still legal way is the taking a double surname; for example, in marriage of Ivanov (he) and Petrovskaya (she), the spouses may adopt the family name Ivanov-Petrovsky and Ivanova-Petrovskaya, correspondingly.

Slavicisation of foreign names
------------------------------

### Slavicisation of foreign surnames

See also: [Azerbaijanization of surnames](/wiki/Azerbaijanization_of_surnames "Azerbaijanization of surnames")

Some surnames in those languages have been [russified](/wiki/Russification "Russification")
 since the 19th century: the surname of Kazakh former [president](/wiki/President_(government_title) "President (government title)")
 [Nursultan Nazarbayev](/wiki/Nursultan_Nazarbayev "Nursultan Nazarbayev")
 has a Russian "-yev" [suffix](/wiki/Suffix "Suffix")
, which literally means "of Nazar-bay" (in which "bay" is a Turkic native [noble](/wiki/Nobility "Nobility")
 [rank](/wiki/Ranks_of_nobility_and_peerage "Ranks of nobility and peerage")
: compare [Turkish](/wiki/Turkish_people "Turkish people")
 "[bey](/wiki/Bey "Bey")
", [Uzbek](/wiki/Uzbeks "Uzbeks")
 "boy" "bek", and [Kyrghyz](/wiki/Kyrgyz_people "Kyrgyz people")
 "bek"). The frequency of such russification varies greatly by country.

After incorporation of [Azerbaijan](/wiki/Azerbaijan "Azerbaijan")
 into the [Soviet Union](/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union")
, it became obligatory to register their surnames and to add a Russian suffix such as _\-yev_ or _\-ov_ for men and _\-yeva_ or _\-ova_ for women.[\[11\]](#cite_note-12)
 Since the majority did not have official surnames, the problem was resolved by adopting the name of the father and adding the mentioned suffixes. Examples are [Aliyev](/wiki/Aliyev "Aliyev")
, [Huseynov](/wiki/Huseynov "Huseynov")
, and [Mammadov](/wiki/Mammadov "Mammadov")
.

Since 1930s and 1940s, surnames and patronymics were obligatory in [Uzbekistan](/wiki/Uzbekistan "Uzbekistan")
.[\[12\]](#cite_note-13)
 The surname could be derived from the name of the father by adding the suffixes -ev after vowels or soft consonants and -ov in all other cases. Examples are [Rashidov](/wiki/Rashidov "Rashidov")
, [Beknazarov](/wiki/Beknazarov "Beknazarov")
 and [Abdullaev](/wiki/Abdullaev "Abdullaev")
. Most of the people born in this time had the same surname as their patronymic.

### Slavicisation of foreign patronymics

By law, foreign persons who adopt [Russian citizenship](/wiki/Russian_citizenship "Russian citizenship")
 are allowed to have no patronymic.[\[13\]](#cite_note-14)
 Some adopt non-Slavonic patronymics as well. For example, the Russian politician [Irina Hakamada](/wiki/Irina_Hakamada "Irina Hakamada")
's patronym is _Муцуовна_ (Mutsuovna) because her [Japanese](/wiki/Japanese_name "Japanese name")
 father's given name was Mutsuo. The ethnicity of origin generally remains recognizable in Russified names. Other examples are [Kazakh](/wiki/Kazakh_language "Kazakh language")
 _ұлы_ (_uly_; transcribed into Latin script as _\-uly_, as in [Nursultan Abish**uly** Nazarbayev](/wiki/Nursultan_Nazarbayev "Nursultan Nazarbayev")
), or [Azeri](/wiki/Patronymic#Azeri "Patronymic")
 _оглы/оғлу_ (_oglu_) (as in [Heydar Alirza **oglu** Aliyev](/wiki/Heydar_Aliyev "Heydar Aliyev")
); Kazakh _қызы_ (transcribed into Latin script as -_qyzy_, as in [Dariga Nursultan**qyzy** Nazarbayeva](/wiki/Dariga_Nazarbayeva "Dariga Nazarbayeva")
).\[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")\
_\] Such Turkic patronymics were officially allowed in the Soviet Union.\[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")\
_\]

[Bruno Pontecorvo](/wiki/Bruno_Pontecorvo "Bruno Pontecorvo")
, after he emigrated to the Soviet Union, was known as _Бруно Максимович Понтекорво_ (Bruno Maximovich Pontekorvo) in the Russian scientific community, as his father's given name was _Massimo_ (corresponding to Russian Максим (Maksim)). His sons have been known by names _Джиль Брунович Понтекорво_ (Gigl Brunovich Pontecorvo), _Антонио Брунович Понтекорво_ (Antonio Brunovich Pontecorvo) and _Тито Брунович Понтекорво_ (Tito Brunovich Pontekorvo).

Forms of address
----------------

### Common rules

*   For informal communication, only the first name is used: Иван Ivan. Even more informally, [diminutives](/wiki/Diminutives "Diminutives")
     (several can be formed from one name) are often used.
*   In rural areas, the patronymic name alone (_Петрович_ Petrovich, _Ивановна_ Ivanovna) is used by old people among themselves, but young people sometimes use the form for irony. Also, younger people can use the form for much older people for both respect and informality. For example, a much younger man with a very good relationship with his elder colleague may use a patronymic and the "ty" form, but using the first name alone is generally inappropriate. Using a diminutive (like in most informal communication) would nearly always be very impolite.
*   The family name alone (_Петров_, Petrov) is used, much more rarely, in formal communications. It is commonly used by school teachers to address their students. Informally, Russians are starting to call people by their surnames alone for irony.
*   the form "first name + patronymic" (for instance, _Иван Иванович_, Ivan Ivanovich):
    *   is the feature of official communication (for instance, students in schools and universities call their teachers in the form of "first name + patronymic" only);
    *   may convey the speaker's respect for the recipient. Historically, patronymics were reserved for the royal dynasty (Рюрико**вич**и, [Rueriko**vich**i](/wiki/Rurikovich "Rurikovich")
        )
*   The full three-name form (for instance, _Иван Иванович Петров_ Ivan Ivanovich Petrov) is used mostly for official documents. With some exceptions, everyone in Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus is supposed to have a three-part name. This form is also used on formal occasions and for introducing oneself to a person who is likely to write down the full name, like a police officer. The family name is placed first (_Петров Иван Иванович_, Petrov Ivan Ivanovich) in various documents, when sorting by personal name is important.

Historically, [diminutives](/wiki/Diminutive "Diminutive")
 of the given names were used in reference to commoners, to indicate an their low status: [Stenka Razin](/wiki/Stenka_Razin "Stenka Razin")
, [Grishka Rasputin](/wiki/Grishka_Rasputin "Grishka Rasputin")
, etc. A diminutive could be used by persons of a higher class when referring to themselves to indicate humility, e.g., when addressing to the [tsar](/wiki/Tsar "Tsar")
.

The choice of addressing format is closely linked to the [choice of second-person pronoun](/wiki/T%E2%80%93V_distinction#Russian "T–V distinction")
. Russian language distinguishes:

*   formal _вы_ (vy, "you"); respectful _Вы_ ("Vy", "You") may be capitalized in formal correspondence, but plural _вы_ ("vy", "you") is not.
*   informal _ты_ (ty, "you", "thou" in old English);

_Вы_ ("Vy") is the plural of both forms to address a pair or group. Historically, it comes from German, under [Peter the Great](/wiki/Peter_the_Great "Peter the Great")
, which uses [_du_ and _Sie_](/wiki/T%E2%80%93V_distinction#Sie_and_du "T–V distinction")
 similarly.\[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")\
_\]

Other than the use of patronymics, Russian forms of address in Russian are very similar to English ones.

Also, the meaning of the form of address strongly depends on the choice of a V-T form:

| Vy or ty | Form | Male example | Female example | Use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Using "Vy" | Full three-name form | Anatoliy Pavlovich Ivanov | Varvara Mikhailovna Kuznetsova | Official documents, very formal occasions (when necessary) |
| First name + patronymic | Anatoliy Pavlovich | Varvara Mikhailovna | General formal or respectful form |
| Surname | Ivanov | Kuznetsova | Formal. Often used by a person of a higher social position (like a teacher talking to a student) |
| Informal first name + informal patronymic | Tol' Palych | Varvara Mikhalna | Respectful but less formal |
| Full first name | Anatoliy | Varvara |
| Diminutive first name | Tolya | Varya | Friendly but still somewhat formal |
| Affectionate first name |     | Varechka | Used almost exclusively towards women, showing fondness but still keeping some formality (like to a younger colleague) |
| Using "Ty" | First name + patronymic | Anatoliy Pavlovich | Varvara Mikhailovna | Can be used between friends on semi-formal occasions or ironically |
| Informal patronymic | Palych | Mikhalna | Combining familiarity and respect |
| Surname | Ivanov | Kuznetsova | Similar in use to a "vy" form but less formal |
| Full first name | Anatoliy | Varvara | Friendly but with a tone of formality. If the name has no diminutive form (Yegor), also used informally |
| Diminutive first name | Tolia | Varya | General informal form |
| Colloquial first name | Tolik | Var'ka | Very familiar form |
| Slang first name | Tolyan | Varyukha |
| Affectionate first name | Tolen'ka | Varechka | Tender, affectionate form |

Using a "ty" form with a person who dislikes it or on inappropriate occasions can be an insult, especially the surname alone.

### Adjectives

Other East Slavic languages use the same adjectives of their literal translation if they differ from Russian analogue. All East Slavic languages are synthetic languages, and grammatical genders are used. Thus, the suffix of an adjective changes with the sex of the recipient.

In Russian, adjectives before names are generally restricted to written forms of communication. Adjectives like _Любимый / Любимая_ (lyubimiy / lyubimaya, "beloved") and _Милый / Милая_ (miliy / milaya, "sweetheart") are informal, and _Уважаемый / Уважаемая_ (uvazhayemiy / uvazhayemaya, literally "respected") is highly formal. Some adjectives, like _Дорогой / Дорогая_ (dorogoy / dorogaya, "dear"), can be used in both formal and informal letters.

**Russian passport expiration date**
------------------------------------

Russian passport expiry date:

*   from 14 years old – until reaching the age of 20;
*   from 20 years – until reaching the age of 45;
*   from 45 years – indefinitely.

**Russian passport machine-readable entry**
-------------------------------------------

Russian domestic passport has special rules and method of forming a machine-readable entry. The machine-readable record contains the surname, name, patronymic, date of birth (year, month, day) of the passport holder, sex of the passport holder, series and number of the passport, code of the migration department issuing the passport, date of issue of the passport, as well as the type of document, state issuing the passport, citizenship of the passport holder.

A machine-readable entry consists of two lines of 44 characters each. The machine-readable entry area is located in the opposite fold of the bottom quarter of the third page of the passport.

A machine-readable entry is entered into the passport with a special printer using the font OCR-B type 1 (Стандарт ИСО 1073/П).

To fill in the positions of characters 6–44 of the top line of a machine-readable record, the “modernized clair” information coding method is used, in which the letters of the Russian alphabet correspond to certain letters of the Latin alphabet and Arabic numbers:

letters of the Russian alphabet

To fill in the positions of the characters on the bottom line of a machine-readable record, a digital method of encoding information is used, except for the positions of characters 11 – 13 and 21.

There is a data structure of the upper and lower machine-readable lines.

**Russian internal passport number format**
-------------------------------------------

These details will tell you how to read a Passport series and number Russian. The series and passport number are recorded in the format XX XX YYYYYY, where XX XX is the 4-digit passport series and YYYYYY is the 6-digit passport number.

Now you know how many digits does a Russian passport have

![numbers in russia internal passport series number and id number](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20600%20137'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Russian passport number example

The first two digits of the passport series correspond to the OKATO code of the region in which the passport was issued; the third and fourth digits of the passport series correspond to the last two digits of the year of issue of the passport form (deviation of 1-3 years is allowed).

What is a series and passport number of a citizen of the Russian Federation? This is an original 10-digit numeric combination. Without looking closely, you can see that there is a small gap between the first four digits and the next six, which distinguishes the series from the number. The first four numerical values are a series of the document, and the remaining six are its number.

If you look closely, the first 4 digits are also pairwise separated from each other, for example, 52 17. The first pair number allows you to find out in which area the citizen received his document.

The digital code in the document allows you to distinguish one document from another. A single surname and name would not be enough, since many people with the same surname, name and date of birth can live in the Russian Federation.

In such a situation, only a given numerical code helps to distinguish one citizen from another. After all, the chance that two citizens have a numerical code will be identical is zero.

If you enter these values in a special database, then the result will be all the information about the person (his name, information about marriage, children, etc.).

**Russian passport number sample**
----------------------------------

Passport number Russia

![Russia passport number sample](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20400%2087'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Russia passport number

Example Russian passport serial number: a passport of a series 45 04 was issued in the city of Moscow, and a passport of a series 37 11 was issued in the Kurgan region in 2011.

For example, if the beginning of the ten-digit code contains the number 52, this means that the document was received in the Nizhny Novgorod region. After the first two-digit number follows the second, which means the year of issue.

From example 52-17 it can be understood that the passport was issued in 2017.

Attention! Sometimes the second number does not coincide with the year of issue, that is, instead of 17 it may be 16 or 18. There is an explanation for this.

This can happen when the issued forms for 2017 ended, and in the passport office began to use forms for the next, 2018. Or vice versa, the year 2016 has passed, and the forms remained on it.

Therefore, if the second two-digit number does not coincide with the year of issue, there is nothing criminal in it.

![Russian passport ID number](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20450%20607'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Russian passport ID number

![Russia passport number](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20450%20318'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Russian passport number format

The photo shows the second and third pages of the passport of a person who is a citizen of Russia. On the right vertically along the entire length of the pages of the document, a series and a number are printed in red font. Russian passport ID number

The first numerical value, consisting of 2 digits – 39, means the area in which the citizen received the document. In the situation presented in the photo above, the document was issued in the Kaliningrad region.

Let’s look at another example with a different arrangement of partially original code of Russian passport series and number.

![Russian passport series and number](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20450%20636'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Russian passport series and number

On the page on the lower right, you can clearly see numbers from small punctures. Everything is similar here, only spaces between numerical values are less noticeable than in the first example.

The last six digits are the serial number in the state database.

Based on this, we can conclude that the first 4 digits of many citizens of the Russian Federation can be identical. But the next six digits of all people are absolutely unique.

“Russian passport (inside). It has been photoshopped.

**Fact Check:**

Alawites, a minority in Syria, are living in fear as reports of killings and forced disappearances have spread, according to [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/01/01/syria-assad-alawites-hts-rebels-violence/)
. Through a reverse image search, Check Your Fact found that the image was photoshopped from an actual passport [shared](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_passport_of_Russia#/media/File:Pasport_RF.jpg)
 to Wikipedia."

The devastating Russian-Ukrainian war has been ongoing for several years, with the United States and NATO providing support to Ukraine. A report can be read [here](https://tass.com/russia/1728697)
. 

**Clarification:**

Peskov’s Comments: It is important to note that Peskov’s remarks about the United States being an “enemy” were part of a broader narrative criticizing American policies and actions towards Russia. The confusion may stem from a recent shift in Russian officials’ rhetoric amid ongoing tensions over the Ukraine conflict.

**Background:**

**Recent Statements by Russian Officials:** Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov referred to the United States as an “enemy” state in a recent press interaction. More details can be read [here](https://www.trtworld.com/us-and-canada/russia-formally-declares-the-us-as-enemy-what-next-18170984)
.

**Misinterpretation**: Peskov’s statement, “We are now an enemy country for them, just as they are for us,” has been misinterpreted on social media as a declaration of war. This is a significant escalation from the term “unfriendly states” that Russian officials have used previously to describe the United States and its allies.

**Context**: Peskov’s comments followed actions by the Biden administration, allowing Ukraine to use American-supplied weapons to attack targets within Russia. In this context, a significant amount of misleading information regarding the situation is being spread on social media.

**Social Media Posts** 

Social media posts claim that Russia has declared war against the USA.

! Details can be read [here](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy770l9llnzo)
. 

**Historical Rhetoric:** Russian President Vladimir Putin has previously referred to the Western countries’ elites as Russia’s enemies while characterizing Ukraine as a tool used by the West. The rhetoric from Russian officials reflects escalating tensions but does not amount to a declaration of war. Social media users should be cautious about misinterpreting or amplifying such statements without verifying the facts through reliable sources.

Ukrainians sought shelter in underground shelters as Russian forces attacked on 24 February 2022

Launching the biggest European invasion since the end of World War Two, Putin gave a fiery speech on TV declaring his goal was to "demilitarise and denazify" Ukraine.

Russia has repeatedly painted modern Ukraine as a Nazi state, in a crass distortion of history.

Putin had already seized Ukraine's Crimean peninsula eight years earlier, after a revolution that ousted Ukraine's pro-Russian president and replaced him with a more pro-Western government.

Putin then triggered a lower-level war in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, with pro-Russian proxy forces occupying territory and setting up rebel states supported by Moscow.

But the 2022 invasion was on a different scale.

Putin had just [recognised the rebel states as independent](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-europe-60470900)
. He has spoken of the Ukrainian leader's "illegitimacy" - a false narrative that has also been repeated by President Trump.

As evidence Putin cites the postponement of Ukraine's March 2024 presidential election, although it is because of Russia's war that Ukraine is under martial law and elections are barred under the constitution.

Putin's own re-election in 2024 is highly questionable, as Russia's opposition leaders are either in exile or dead.

Was Nato expansion to blame for the war?
----------------------------------------

Putin has for years complained about Nato's eastward expansion as a security threat, and sees any possibility of Ukraine joining the alliance as a major red line.

Before Russia's 2022 invasion he demanded that Nato remove multinational deployments from the Central and Eastern European states that joined the Western alliance after 1997.

But it was Russia that launched military action in Eastern Europe, when it invaded Georgia in 2008 and then Crimea in 2014.

After the Crimea invasion, Nato established a continuous presence on its eastern flank - closest to Russia.

Nato has always stressed the whole purpose of the alliance is to defend territories "with no aggressive intentions". <image:2680>!A map showing the expansion of Nato over time <image:2687>

Zelensky said as much two weeks into the invasion: "Nato is not prepared to accept Ukraine."

He has since said he would consider resigning in exchange for Nato membership, but Trump says Kyiv should "forget about" joining the Western alliance.

Putin has accused Nato of participating in the war, because its member states have increasingly sent Ukraine military hardware, including tanks and fighter jets, air defence systems, missile systems, artillery and drones.

Nato has provided security assistance and training to Ukraine, but it insists that does not make it a party to the war.

Putin's grievance against Nato dates back to 1990, when he claims the West promised not to expand "an inch to the East".

However that was before the Soviet Union collapsed and it was based on a limited commitment made to then Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.

Gorbachev said "the topic of Nato expansion was never discussed" at the time.

How could the war end?
----------------------

The most likely route is through direct talks, although previous rounds of negotiations between the two sides made little progress on a ceasefire.

After a fifth visit to Moscow by Trump envoy Steve Witkoff on 6 August, the US president said a there was a "good chance" he could meet the Russian and Ukrainian leaders for talks in person.

The Kremlin also said a Trump-Putin meeting would happen in the coming days, but Putin ruled out an imminent meeting with Zelensky, saying the right conditions were not in place.

So far though, the two sides have been unable to find a way of bridging their differences.

Russia wants direct talks to address the "root causes of the conflict", a phrase that harks back to Putin's "maximalist" demands at the start of the war in March 2022.

These included Ukraine becoming a neutral state, dramatically reducing its military and abandoning its Nato aspirations.

Russia also wants international recognition of its territorial gains in Ukraine reflected in any future deal, including annexation of Crimea and four eastern regions. <image:2680>!Reuters Vladimir Putin remembering Russia's victory over Nazi Germany wears a long coat as soldiers pass him by carrying swords <image:2689>Reuters

Vladimir Putin has made repeated false allegations of genocide and Nazi taunts against Ukraine

At the start of the 2022 invasion, Putin vowed to protect people in occupied areas of eastern Ukraine from eight years of Ukrainian "bullying and genocide, during the war in the east.

More than 14,000 people died on both sides of the front line between 2014-2022, but Russian claims of Ukrainian Nazis committing genocide in the occupied regions never added up, and no international body has spoken of genocide. It abandoned its nuclear weapons in 1994 in return for guaranteed security from Russia, the UK and US which Moscow failed to respect.

Since the war, many Ukrainians have turned their back on Russian, and Zelensky himself avoids using the language in public.

When Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered up to 200,000 soldiers into Ukraine, his aim was to sweep into the capital, Kyiv, in days, overthrow its pro-Western government and return Ukraine to Russia's sphere of influence.

Putin failed but, more than three years on, a fifth of Ukrainian territory is in Russian hands.

US President Donald Trump has been trying to negotiate a peace deal and the Kremlin says Putin will meet Trump "in the coming days". Last year he told US TV talk show host Tucker Carlson that Ukraine was an "artificial state".

Those comments have led many to believe that the goal of the invasion was in effect to erase the state of Ukraine.

Russia's state-run Ria news agency explained that "denazification is inevitably also de-Ukrainisation" - seemingly tying the idea of erasing Ukraine to the stated goal of the invasion.

Ukrainian culture and identity have in fact existed for centuries independently of Russia.

Does Putin want to get rid of Zelensky?
---------------------------------------

! <image:2680>!Getty Images The president of Ukraine holds his hands out, flanked by two Ukrainian flags <image:2685>Getty Images

Volodymyr Zelensky was elected president in Ukraine in 2019

Putin has long sought to get rid of Ukraine's elected pro-Western president, and Zelensky was apparently a target from the very start of the war.

Russian troops made two attempts to storm the presidential compound soon after the invasion, according to Zelensky's adviser, and Ukraine's elected leader said they wanted him dead.

"The enemy has designated me as target number one; my family is target number two.

"[They want to destroy Ukraine politically](https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/zvernennya-prezidenta-do-ukrayinciv-naprikinci-pershogo-dnya-73149)
 by destroying the head of state."

Zelensky said later that Putin had initially tried to replace him with the wealthy head of a pro-Russian party, Viktor Medvedchuk, who was accused of treason in Ukraine and is now in Russia.

Even now, Putin has not agreed to peace talks with Zelensky and his officials call him a "loser" and a "clown". It will also look for Western security guarantees to ensure Russia never invades its territory again.

Was Zelensky to blame for the war?
----------------------------------

Before his return to the White House and in the first months of his presidency, Trump suggested Ukraine's president was responsible for the war with Russia.

"\[Zelensky\] should never have let the war start, that war's a loser," he said in October 2024.

In reality, the war began in 2014, when Putin seized Crimea and Russian proxies grabbed part of eastern Ukraine. Putin then ordered Russia's full-scale invasion eight years later, after months of meticulous co-ordination and denials of any such plan.

However, the US president's messaging has not been altogether consistent, and in recent weeks his position appears to have hardened against Russia.

"We thought we had \[the war\] settled numerous times, and then President Putin goes out and starts launching rockets into some city like Kyiv and kills a lot of people," he said last month.

Trump has announced sweeping new secondary tariffs on any country still trading with Russia if a ceasefire with Ukraine is not agreed by Friday, 8 August.

Do Putin's claims on Nazis and genocide stack up?

Content: "After each of them—Serbia in 2000, Georgia in 2003, Ukraine in 2004, the Arab Spring in 2011, Russia in 2011–12, and Ukraine in 2013–14—Putin has pivoted to more hostile policies toward the United States, and then invoked the NATO threat as justification for doing so.

Boris Yeltsin never supported NATO expansion but acquiesced to the first round of expansion in 1997 because he believed that his close ties to President Bill Clinton and the United States were not worth sacrificing over this comparatively smaller matter. Following John Mearsheimer’s provocative 2014 _Foreign Affairs_ article arguing that “the Ukraine crisis is the West’s fault,” the narrative of Russian backlash against NATO expansion has become a dominant framework for explaining—if not justifying—Moscow’s ongoing war against Ukraine.[1](#f1)
 This notion has been repeated not only in Moscow but in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere by politicians, analysts, and writers. By this telling, the specter of Ukraine’s NATO membership points both to the cause of the conflict and its solution: Take membership off the table for Ukraine, so the argument goes, and future wars will be prevented.

### Michael McFaul

_**Michael McFaul**, former U.S. If NATO was _always_ a threat to Russia and its “sphere of influence,” why did Putin facilitate the opening of these bases in the former Soviet Union?

During his November 2001 visit to the United States, Putin struck a realistic but cooperative tone:

> We differ in the ways and means we perceive that are suitable for reaching the same objective . Putin blamed the United States directly for assisting this democratic breakthrough and helping to install someone whom he saw as a pro-American puppet, President Mikheil Saakashvili. Since the Revolution of Dignity, Putin has waged an unprecedented assault against Ukraine’s democracy using a full spectrum of military, political, informational, social, and economic weapons in an attempt to destabilize and eventually topple Ukraine’s democratically elected government.[18](#f18)
 Ukraine’s relationship with NATO and the United States was just a symptom of what Putin believes is the underlying disease: a sovereign, democratic Ukraine.

Putin’s Real _Casus Belli_: Ukrainian Democracy

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

From [Source](https://www.russiamatters.org/blog/russias-economy-collapsing): 
Content: "For one, the [IMF](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2025/01/17/world-economic-outlook-update-january-2025)
 and [World Bank](https://thedocs.worldbank.org/en/doc/c50bc3c87bc2666b9e5fa6699b0b2849-0050012025/related/GEP-Jan-2025-Analysis-ECA.pdf)
 estimate that the Russian economy grew by 3.8% and 3.4%, respectively, in 2024.3 Looking ahead, both expect the Russian economy to continue growing in 2025–2026, even though this growth is expected to slow down. The same year saw 19 new Russian dollar billionaires join Forbes’s ranking, which is the highest number of new dollar billionaires Russia has produced since 2011, according to [Re: Russia](https://re-russia.net/en/analytics/0233/)
.

As the economy grew in 2024, so did Russia’s budget revenues, even though this growth was not sufficient to eliminate the aforementioned budget deficit. Olga Chyzh of the University of Toronto also took a dim view of the Russian economy in her recent commentary for The Guardian, entitled “A string of assassinations, a [faltering economy](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/dec/19/russia-assassinations-economy-workers-putin)
, a shortage of workers: the pressure on Putin is ratcheting up.” In this Dec. 2024, commentary, Chyzh writes that Russia’s “economy is faltering under the combined strain of the war and Western sanctions.” “War-driven salary increases … have triggered a vicious cycle of inflation and subsequent interest-rate hikes. Writing in The Hill in October 2024, he predicts that a “Russian economic meltdown is coming next year.” “Leonid Brezhnev’s Soviet Union should have taught Putin a lesson,” warns Motyl, who has repeatedly predicted [Russia’s collapse](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=Alexander+Motyl+Russia+collapse)
. 5, 2024, entitled “[The collapse of the Russian economy](https://www.counteroffensive.news/p/the-collapse-of-the-russian-economy)
,” on American journalist Tim Mak’s Substack, “Counteroffensive.” The Kyiv-based Euromaidan Press outlet then published a commentary by [Yurii Bohdanov](https://euromaidanpress.com/author/yuriybohdanov/ "View all posts by Yurii Bohdanov")
 on Jan. 17, 2025, in which he claims that “even ‘freezing’ the war in Ukraine will not solve Russia’s economic problems… and a freeze only delays the inevitable collapse.” 

### Russia Doesn’t Have a Clean Bill of Health

Some of the aforementioned criticism of what the [IMF](https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/PPPSH@WEO/OEMDC/ADVEC/WEOWORLD)
 ranks as the world’s 4th largest economy in terms of PPP is valid. In fact, Russia’s budget revenues in December 2024 reached more than 4 trillion rubles ($40 billion), up by 28% compared to December 2023, the highest level recorded in ministry data beginning from January 2011, according to [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-21/russia-s-budget-revenue-surges-to-record-in-december-despite-sanctions "(opens in a new window)")
.5 One sector of the Russian economy which provides much of the money6 that is accumulated in the Russian budget and that the Kremlin then spends on its war, is the energy sector. Gazprom, the national gas champion, is estimated to have lost more [than $3 billion](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/gazprom-reports-9-month-loss-32-billion-2024-10-29/)
 in the first nine months of 2024, for instance.)

### Conclusion 

No economy is completely healthy, and Russia’s is, by far, no exception, particularly given Western sanctions and its rampant spending on the military-industrial complex and the war against Ukraine.

Is Russia’s Economy Collapsing?
===============================

February 06, 2025

[Simon Saradzhyan](/authors/simon-saradzhyan)

The past few months have seen a number of Russia watchers echo each other’s proclamations that the Russian economy is either already collapsing or close to crumbling. 

Will these predictions materialize?

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that the IMF provides information about Russia's economy, including projections for GDP growth. Additionally, russiamatters.org states that the IMF ranks Russia as the world's 4th largest economy in terms of PPP. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the IMF declared Russia the fourth-largest economy in the world in October 2024.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified with the provided evidence. The exact date of the IMF's ranking and the specific criteria used (PPP or nominal GDP) are missing.

Clips of Hegseth calling Vladimir Putin a "war criminal" appeared online after he was nominated as secretary of defense by President-elect Donald Trump. Think about it through the psychology of him."

The Facts

While Hegseth aligned with the claim that Putin was a "war criminal," the clip shared online was from March 2022 not long after the outbreak of the conflict.

Since then Hegseth has been more cautious, and critical of the U.S. spending on the conflict, claims appeared on social media repeating comments Hegseth had made criticizing Russian President [Vladimir Putin](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/vladimir-putin)
 in bold terms.

!Pete Hegseth <image:2703>

Pete Hegseth on May 31, 2019, in New York City. intervention in Ukraine and the prognosis from others that Russia's intervention would lead to wider conflict.

In an episode of the _Shawn Ryan Show_ Podcast from November 2024, Hegseth said he did not see Putin taking the world into a wider global or nuclear conflict, saying his gains would be incremental, part of what he called a "get my s\*\*\* back" conflict.

"I found it overinflated from the beginning this idea that Vladimir Putin's attack on Ukraine was going to lead to nuclear war or war across the continent," Hegseth said.

"I've always felt like it was from the beginning, like a couple days in, I like, this feels like the Putin's 'give me my s\*\*\* back' war.

"It kind of feels like \[Putin thought\] 'I feel like you've been pushing pretty hard, and we used to have the former Soviet Union, and we're pretty proud of that, and Ukraine was a part of it, and all these other... I think he probably knows enough to know that it's probably not going much further than Ukraine.

"And I don't think he's a suicidal maniac who's hell-bent on bringing in armageddon with nuclear warfare."

Elsewhere, he has also defended Trump's comment in 2022 calling Putin "very savvy" after the Russian president announced Moscow's recognition of the independence of [two self-proclaimed republics](https://www.newsweek.com/blinken-says-swift-response-needed-russia-recognizing-new-republics-1681212)
 in eastern Ukraine.

While the White House and the [EU](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/eu)
 described Putin's actions as a violation of international law and a pretext for an invasion, Trump said [Putin's move was "genius" and "very savvy."](https://www.newsweek.com/trump-calls-putin-moving-troops-ukraine-peacekeeping-genius-1681557)

Hegseth defended the comments saying that Trump was trying to tease the media for obsessing over the Russian leader

"Here's the reality, Vladimir Putin lives rent-free in the minds of our media, of the American media," Hegseth said.

"No organism, no entity has done more to spread Russian propaganda and to prop up the strawman that is Vladimir Putin than our very own media."

In a [Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/video/6320895317112)
 interview in February 2023 with South Carolina [Republican](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/republican)
 Representative [Nancy Mace](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/nancy-mace)
, Hegseth criticized the number of times President [Joe Biden](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/joe-biden)
 had visited Ukraine compared to the southern border of the U.S., and the "billions spent in Ukraine" suggesting he was ignoring "our problems at home."

He also asked "what do we get out of" the billions the U.S."

“There are good guys and bad guys in this war, and the Russians are the bad guys,” Wicker said. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth made a “rookie mistake” when he said a return to Ukraine’s pre-war borders was “unrealistic,” Senate Armed Services Chair Roger Wicker said Friday.

Hegseth on Thursday [pulled back some of the comments](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/13/hegseth-pull-back-00204088)
 he made about Ukraine a day earlier, where he said that NATO membership for Kyiv was off the table and that the country could not return to its internationally recognized borders. 

“Hegseth is going to be a great defense secretary, although he wasn’t my choice for the job,” the Mississippi Republican [told POLITICO on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference](https://www.politico.eu/politico-munich-security-conference-2025/)
. Wicker said he favors a firm posture with Moscow.

“Everybody knows … and people in the administration know you don't say before your first meeting what you will agree to and what you won't agree to,” Wicker said, adding that he was “puzzled” and “disturbed” by Hegseth’s comments.

President Donald Trump this week held a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on ending the war; Vice President JD Vance will meet in Munich Friday with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Hegseth wasn't freelancing. “But he made a rookie mistake in Brussels and he’s walked back some of what he said but not that line."

"I don’t know who wrote the speech — it is the kind of thing Tucker Carlson could have written, and Carlson is a fool," Wicker said, referring to the pro-Putin broadcaster.

Speaking to Jonathan Martin at the POLITICO Pub in the Munich conference, Wicker — a staunch Ukraine supporter — said he was “surprised” by Hegseth’s original comments and “heartened” that the new defense secretary had reversed course. Trump on Thursday said there was a "good possibility of ending that horrible, very bloody war." He also said it was not "practical" for Kyiv to join NATO and "unlikely" that Ukraine could return to its 2014 pre-invasion borders.

The direct talks between Trump and Putin have left European allies rattled that the EU and Ukraine could be sidelined in any peace deal.

Amid Trump’s talks with Putin, Wicker took a more hawkish stance that is in line with traditional Republican views. resolve, arguing that failing to arm Ukraine could force American troops into future wars.

On Friday, Wicker also called for the U.S."

The session revealed deep divisions within the GOP on U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth (R) looks on as U.S. [Mitch McConnell](https://kyivindependent.com/mcconnells-exit-signals-shift-in-republican-support-for-ukraine/)
 of Kentucky, one of three Republicans who voted against Hegseth’s confirmation, who warned, "America’s reputation is on the line."

McConnell, now chair of the panel overseeing defense funding, issued some of his strongest public criticism yet, questioning whether the United States would continue defending democratic allies against authoritarian threats.

He contrasted his stance — rooted in a Reagan-era commitment to global leadership — with Hegseth’s "America First" approach favored by many Trump supporters. "We don’t want a headline at the end of this conflict that says [Russia](https://kyivindependent.com/tag/russia/)
 wins and America loses," McConnell said.

When asked who the aggressor in the three-year-old war is, [Hegseth](https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-bracing-for-painful-reduction-in-us-military-aid-after-hegseth-announces-cuts/)
 responded, "Russia is the aggressor." But he avoided directly stating which side the U.S. wants to see win, instead emphasizing that President Trump is committed to achieving peace.

The U.S. Air Force has answered a questioned that burned in people’s minds as bystanders were hurriedly pushed back to safer locations several times and the 215 Freeway was closed after [the crash of an Air National Guard F-16 fighter jet](https://www.pressenterprise.com/2019/05/16/plane-crashes-near-march-air-reserve-base-215-freeway-shut-down/)
 near March Air Reserve Base in 2019:

Why didn’t the missiles aboard the Flying Falcon explode on impact?

The reason, the Air Force said this week, is that the ordnance attached to the F-16 during its intercept training mission were never armed.

“Aircraft flying this mission do fly with live ordnance. In order for the weapons to detonate, there are multiple conditions that must be met, including arming and launching of the weapon to complete the detonation sequences,” said Capt. Tisha J. Yates, an Air Force spokeswoman at Joint Base Langley-Eustis in Virginia.

The missiles were eventually removed from the jet as it sat in a warehouse on Opportunity Way near the Riverside-Moreno Valley border. They were trucked to nearby Ben Clark Training Center, [where they were destroyed in a controlled detonation](https://www.pressenterprise.com/2019/05/17/x-9/)
.

“The determination to move civilians away from the scene was a safety measure put in place by the incident commander on scene and in coordination with NORAD based on the hazards present until all munitions were secured,” Yates said in response to questions from this news organization, [which first reported the cause of the crash](https://www.pressenterprise.com/2020/04/23/hydraulic-failure-caused-f-16-to-crash-near-march-base-last-year-air-force-says/)
.

The F-16 was assigned to the 114th Fighter Wing at Joe Foss Field in South Dakota. The pilot was attached to the 144th Fighter Wing at March.

On May 16, 2019, the pilot was returning from the two-jet maneuvers about 120 miles east of March when he lost hydraulic pressure and therefore the ability to control the aircraft. At 3:39 p.m., after burning off fuel, he ejected about 250 feet off the ground less than a mile from the base. The pilot suffered minor injuries, as did about a dozen people in the warehouse where the plane crashed.

The Air Force concluded in its 22-page accident report that the $24 million jet lost the fluid from its two hydraulic tanks when two inlet check valves — each less than an inch tall — failed because they were improperly installed.

Each valve consists of a cap, screw threads, a retainer ring and an O-ring that collectively are referred to as a screw cap. That screw cap screws into the valve body. The retainer helps keep the O-ring in place. It is primarily the screw cap retainer and O-ring that prevent hydraulic fluid from leaking under high pressure.

The investigation determined that both screw caps were not properly screwed into the valve bodies. The retainers were found to be deformed, and portions of the O-rings were missing. As a result, hydraulic fluid leaked out through the threads between the screw caps and the valve bodies.

A suspected hydraulic leak had been noted in the jet in March 2019. A new flight-control system that had been overhauled months earlier was installed on March 28, and the plane flew 10 more missions without incident before the crash. The report concluded that the overhaul process lacked “an effective procedure to identify improper installation of ISA check valves.” ISA stands for Integrated Servo Actuator, a flight-control system.

In the wake of the crash, the Air Force also said this week that it studied the overhaul process and found a problem with how the inlet check valve was assembled during overhauls, said Derek Kaufman, a civilian spokesman for the Air Force Materiel Command at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio.

There are two approved configurations of the valves. The older configuration uses smaller Teflon backing rings, and newer configurations use larger rings. The team discovered the potential for installation of the wrong-size backing ring since both size rings were packaged side by side, Kaufman said.

As a result, the Air Force changed the process for assembling the valves during overhauls. It separated the installation and inspection steps on the work documentation and added a secondary quality check for just O-ring backing ring installation. And it inserted a “quality stamp” of the entire process for the first six months after the changes to ensure proper training was accomplished.

The Air Force also inspected all of its inlet check valves and found three to be defective. Those were fixed, Kaufman said.

“We review the facts for any lessons that can be applied to maintenance processes and training to improve the safety and quality of systems we deliver to our warfighters,” he said.

The improper installation of two parts caused an [F-16](/weapons/f-16/ "Learn more about the F-16 Fighting Falcon")
‘s hydraulic system to fail, making the pilot [lose control and crash into a warehouse in May 2019](https://www.airforcemag.com/f-16-crashes-during-norad-training-in-california/)
 while flying back to March Air Reserve Base, Calif., Air Force investigators found.

The F-16 pilot successfully ejected before the Viper crashed into the civilian building. The aircraft was destroyed at a loss of $24.99 million, and caused about $3.9 million in damage to the warehouse, according to an Air Combat Command Accident Investigation Board report.

The F-16C, tail number 88-0477 from the South Dakota Air National Guard’s 114th Fighter Wing, was operated by a pilot from the California Air National Guard’s 144th Fighter Wing Detachment 1 at March for homeland defense missions. On May 16, 2019, the F-16C took off as part of a two-ship formation for an aerospace control alert training mission in a nearby military operating area.

The two F-16s flew one-versus-one tactical intercepts, low-level proficiency training, and local area familiarization. While flying near Palm Springs, the pilot began receiving cockpit warnings of a potential hydraulic system issue with gauges showing low pressure and began going through appropriate checklists, according to the report.

About 20 miles from base, the pilot deployed speed brakes and lowered the landing gear to burn more fuel and let the wingman visually inspect the aircraft. With the speed brakes and gear deployed and locked, the pilot did not yet declare an emergency, but continued the approach to March, the report states.

The aircraft then indicated further loss of pressure in both of its “A and B” systems, and the pilot consulted checklists for dual hydraulic failure. Once they got close to the base, the wingman landed first on one of the base’s runways, allowing the damaged F-16 to land on a runway with an arresting cable.

With both hydraulic systems failing, the pilot declared an emergency and turned on emergency power as a precaution before starting a straight-in approach to the runway. About one mile before touching down, at about 300 feet above ground level, the F-16 began to roll to the left without any pilot input. The pilot tried to maintain control, and counter the roll, but the aircraft rolled hard to the right in a way that was inconsistent with the pilot’s input.

After losing control of the aircraft, the pilot ejected. Immediately after punching out, the F-16 crashed into the warehouse, located across a major highway from the base. A photograph of the impact shows the F-16’s nose sheared off and wings largely removed in a pile of boxes and equipment. The pilot parachuted onto the runway overrun at the base, and was briefly hospitalized with minor injuries.

The Accident Investigation Board found that the cause of the mishap was two improperly installed hydraulic check valves in the aircraft’s right flaperon integrated survoactuator—a part that translates electrical commands to the movement of flight control surfaces. For both of the parts that failed, investigators found the same problem: the retainer on a screw cap had deformed, with fragments tearing away allowing fluid to leak.

“This condition allowed hydraulic fluid to leak from both systems resulting in decreased hydraulic pressure to move flight control surfaces,” the report said. “The \[pilot\] set up to land as soon as possible, but the system had lost enough pressure on final approach to prevent the \[aircraft\] from sustaining controlled flight.”

Maintainers with the 144th Fighter Wing Detachment 1 installed the parts as part of unscheduled maintenance in March 2019 after a possible hydraulic leak was discovered. The parts went through operational checks with no discrepancies found, and the aircraft had flown 10 sorties for 16.3 hours before the crash. The AIB states that there was an inadequate overhaul process, which lacked an effective procedure to identify problems with the installation of the check valves.

An inlet check valve from the F-16 Fighting Falcon that crashed near March Air Reserve Base on May 16, 2019, is shown during the investigation into the crash. The U.S. Air Force concluded that the valve was improperly installed, leading to a leak of hydraulic fuel that rendered the pilot unable to control the aircraft. (Courtesy of U.S. Air Force)

A loss of hydraulic pressure prevented the pilot of the Air National Guard’s F-16 [that crashed near March Air Reserve Base](https://www.pe.com/2019/05/16/plane-crashes-near-march-air-reserve-base-215-freeway-shut-down/)
 last year from controlling the jet, the U.S. Air Force says in a report.

The pilot ejected and parachuted onto a base runway on May 16, 2019, suffering minor injuries. The $24 million Fighting Falcon plummeted through the roof of a warehouse, destroying the jet and causing a small fire.

Twelve people in the warehouse were treated for exposure to the debris, the Cal Fire/Riverside County Fire Department said at the time.

The 22-page report, dated April 14, said two inlet-check valves were improperly installed, resulting in damage to them that caused hydraulic fuel to leak.

The valves were part of a flight-control system that was overhauled in January 2019 and installed in the jet after a possible hydraulic leak was discovered several months later.

“The evidence also indicated an inadequate overhaul process that lacked an effective procedure to identify improper installation of ISA check valves,” the report says.

The F-16 was one of two jets initially practicing 120 miles east of March, which sits on the Riverside-Moreno Valley border. The planes were returning to March when the one jet lost hydraulic pressure.

The pilot burned off fuel before ejecting, the report says.

The F-16 was assigned to the 114th Fighter Wing at Joe Foss Field in South Dakota and ran some missions for the 144th Fighter Wing at March.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

Renovated in 2018, the facility in Toropets is estimated to have stored tonnes upon tonnes of military goods, including explosives, artillery shells and ballistic missiles.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A Ukrainian drone attack on a significant Russian weapons stockpile in the Tver region in the early hours of Wednesday might be the Ukrainian army's biggest hit against Moscow's arsenal since early 2022.

The blast from the strike was so strong that earthquake monitoring stations picked it up as if it were a minor earthquake, while NASA reported a series of heat sources spotted by its equipment from space.

The facility in Toropets is estimated to have stored around 30,000 tonnes of military munitions. The destruction of the ammunition that was stored there will most likely negatively affect the northern operational group of the Russian army.

But what is the Russian military storage facility in Toropets and how important is it?

Renovated in 2018, the facility in Toropets is estimated to have stored tonnes upon tonnes of military goods, including explosives, artillery shells and ballistic missiles.

The former Russian deputy defence minister Dmitry Bulgakov — who was arrested earlier this year on corruption charges — said after the renovations that the site met the "highest international standards" and could defend weapons from missiles and "even a small nuclear attack".

The storage site covered an area of over 5 square kilometres in size and a perimeter of more than 12 kilometres long. 

**Which missiles were stored at the facility?**
-----------------------------------------------

The town of Toropets is situated around 470 kilometers north of the Ukrainian border and the destruction of the ammunition that was stored there will most likely negatively affect the northern operational group of the Russian army, including the supply of troops in Kursk, Belgorod and Bryansk.

According to Ukrainian sources, the military site in Toropets reportedly housed fuel tanks, as well as missiles intended for Iskander missile systems, Tochka-U missile systems, guided aerial bombs and assorted artillery ammunition.

The head of Ukraine's Centre for Countering Disinformation, Andriy Kovalenko, said that in addition to its own ammunition, Russia had also started to store North Korean munitions in Toropets.

Maxar satellite service collected imagery clearly shows the extent of the damage from the Ukrainian drone attack causing a series of explosions, according to a photo shared by the Russia Team Lead at the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). 

The imagery shows large pillars of smoke covering much of the area, while a closer look at the ammunition storage area indicates that fires continue to burn in and near some bunkers, ISW's George Barros added.

**Have the storage bunkers been destroyed?**
--------------------------------------------

Most of the ammunition is presumably stored underground, so the question is whether Ukraine used any drones that could have penetrated inside the bunkers.

A full damage assessment remains impossible due to the thick smoke above the site. However, the possible destruction of the bunkers might have also been the result of Moscow not respecting its own regulations by placing the bunkers too close together, for example.

While repeatedly calling on the West to lift the restrictions over the use of long-range missiles deep into Russian territory, Ukraine has been using its home-produced UAVs to strike as deep as 1,800 kilometres into Russia, as was the case in the city of Orsk.

LONDON, Sept 18 (Reuters) - A large-scale Ukrainian drone attack on Russia triggered an earthquake-sized blast at a major arsenal in the Tver region on Wednesday, forcing the evacuation of a nearby town, war bloggers and some media reported.

Unverified video and images on social media showed a huge ball of flame blasting into the night sky and multiple detonations thundering across a lake about 380 km (240 miles) west of Moscow.

 in the area.

"The enemy hit an ammunition depot in the area of Toropets," said Yuri Podolyaka, a Ukrainian-born, pro-Russian military blogger. "Everything that can burn is already burning there (and exploding)."

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, speaking in his nightly video address, hailed the outcome of the attack without referring specifically to the target.

"A very important result was achieved last night on Russian territory and such actions weaken the enemy," Zelenskiy said. "I thank everyone involved. Such precision is truly inspiring."

He thanked the SBU security service, the HUR intelligence service and the Special Operations Forces.

A source in Ukraine's SBU state security service had earlier told Reuters the drone attack had destroyed [a warehouse storing missiles](/world/europe/ukraine-destroyed-arsenal-russias-tver-region-kyiv-security-source-says-2024-09-18/)
, guided bombs and artillery ammunition.

Russian state media have in the past reported that a major arsenal for conventional weapons was located at the site of the blasts. State media, now subject to military censorship laws, was muted in its reporting on Wednesday.

Igor Rudenya, governor of the Tver region, said that Ukrainian drones had been shot down, that a fire had broken out and that some residents were being evacuated. He did not say what was burning.

One woman told Reuters that members of her family had been evacuated from Toropets.

"A fire started with explosions," said the woman, who identified herself only as Irina.

Rudenya later said the situation in Toropets was stable as of midday local time (0900 GMT) and that evacuated residents could return. The fire had been put out and there were no recorded fatalities, he said.

Russia and Ukraine each reported dozens of enemy drone attacks on their territory overnight, with Russian forces advancing in eastern [Ukraine](https://www.reuters.com/topic/event/ukraine-crisis/)
.

MAJOR EXPLOSION
---------------

The size of the main blast shown in the unverified social media video was consistent with 200-240 tons of high explosives detonating, said George William Herbert of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey in California.

A Toropets chatroom on the Russian social media site VK was flooded with messages of support from other parts of the country and offers of help to people fleeing the town.

Some people were asking whether buildings at specific addresses were still standing.

"People, does anyone know what's happened to Kudino village??? They told me nothing is left of our house," posted one woman.

Another woman replied: "It's horror there." Kudino is a village 4.5 km (2.8 miles) northeast of Toropets.

Some war bloggers asked how drones could trigger such large blasts at what was thought to be a highly fortified facility.

According to an RIA state news agency report from 2018, Russia was building an arsenal for the storage of missiles, ammunition and explosives in Toropets, a 1,000-year-old town, with a population of just over 11,000.

Dmitry Bulgakov, then a deputy defence minister, told RIA in 2018 that the facility could defend weapons from missiles and even a small nuclear attack. Bulgakov was arrested earlier this year on corruption charges, which he denies.

"It (the concrete facilities) ensures their reliable and safe storage, protects them from air and missile strikes and even from the damaging factors of a nuclear explosion," RIA quoted Bulgakov as saying at the time.

Some Russians on chat groups expressed anger.

"Why wasn't the ammunition underground?! What are you doing???? In Kudino, houses were blown away! Why is the forest burning and no one is there... What kind of negligence is this!!!!" one woman posted.

Russia reported that its air defence units had destroyed 54 drones launched against five Russian regions overnight, without mentioning Tver. Ukraine said it had [shot down 46 of 52 drones](/world/europe/russian-drones-attack-energy-facilities-ukraines-sumy-authorities-say-2024-09-18/)
 launched by Moscow overnight and that Russia had used three guided air missiles which did not reach their targets.

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian [drones struck a large military depot in a town deep inside Russia](https://apnews.com/article/poland-us-blinken-duda-ukraine-54232b14cae7785df02f9d48a77e7823)
 overnight, causing a huge fire and forcing some residents to evacuate, a Ukrainian official and Russian news reports said Wednesday. At least 13 people were injured, Russia’s Health Ministry added.

Meanwhile, a senior U.S. diplomat said [Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-kursk-incursion-gamble-battlefield-e862afd58c65d6d2d5b7b3747423ca4d)
 has a workable plan to end the war, now in its third year, although its details have not been publicly disclosed.

Ukraine claimed the strike destroyed military warehouses in Toropets, a town in Russia’s Tver region about 380 kilometers (240 miles) northwest of Moscow and about 500 kilometers (300 miles) from the border with Ukraine.

The attack was carried out by Ukraine’s Security Service, along with Ukraine’s Intelligence and Special Operations Forces, a Kyiv security official told The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the operation.

According to the official, the depot housed Iskander and Tochka-U missiles, as well as glide bombs and artillery shells. He said the facility caught fire in the strike and was burning across an area 6 kilometers (4 miles) wide.

Among the destroyed ammunition were North Korean KN-23 short-range ballistic missiles, another official, in Ukraine’s Intelligence Office, told AP. He also was not authorized to comment publicly and didn’t provide evidence to support his claim.

Russia and North Korea signed [a landmark pact](https://apnews.com/article/russia-putin-kim-north-korea-pact-556492779b6a32c4cf74b992741d91a8)
 in June that envisioned mutual military assistance between Moscow and Pyongyang.

More than 100 domestically produced exploding drones were deployed in the attack on the depot, the Ukrainian intelligence official added.

Russian state news agency RIA Novosti quoted regional authorities as saying air defense systems were working to repel a “massive drone attack” on Toropets, which has a population of about 11,000. The agency also reported a fire and the evacuations, and the Health Ministry said 13 people were hospitalized in the region after the attack.

Tver regional Gov. Igor Rudenya later said all evacuees could return home.

Successful Ukrainian strikes deep inside Russia have become more common as Kyiv developed its drone technology.

Zelenskyy also is seeking approval from Western nations for Ukraine to use the sophisticated weapons they are providing to hit targets inside Russia. Some Western leaders have balked at that, fearing they could be dragged into the conflict.

Part of Kyiv’s strategy is targeting of military equipment, ammunition and infrastructure deep inside Russia, as well as making civilians feel some of the consequences of the war that is being fought largely inside Ukraine.

The swift push by Ukrainian forces [into Russia’s Kursk border region](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-kursk-incursion-putin-1178b99b32b476816db3a48ffa06b11a)
 last month fits into that plan, which apparently seeks to compel Russian President Vladimir Putin to back down.

Putin, however, has shown no signs of that [and has been trying to grind down Ukraine’s resolve](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-putin-military-numbers-9c5554302486adfe7b3d69cb297f8a98)
 through attritional warfare and also sap the West’s support for Kyiv by drawing out the conflict. That has come at a price, however, as the U.K. Defense Ministry estimates the war has probably killed or wounded more than 600,000 Russian troops.

On Tuesday, Putin ordered the country’s military to [increase its number of troops](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-putin-military-numbers-9c5554302486adfe7b3d69cb297f8a98)
 by 180,000 to a total of 1.5 million by Dec. 1.

Zelenskyy announced his war plan in his nightly address on Monday, saying it’s 90% ready and will be presented to allies over the next week.

He said Ukraine’s [plan for victory](https://apnews.com/video/ukraine-government-kyiv-volodymyr-zelenskyy-ukraine-war-and-unrest-be06ac55f33246fd96f1898bac5a6884)
 includes not only battlefield goals but also diplomatic and economic wins. The plan has been kept under wraps but the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said at a news conference Tuesday that Washington officials have seen it.

“We think it lays out a strategy and a plan that can work,” she said, adding that the United States will bring it up with other world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly in New York next week. She did not comment on what the plan contained.

Video shows explosions after drone attack on Russian ammunition depot

00:58

CNN  — 

A Ukrainian drone attack launched overnight destroyed an ammunition depot in the western Russian region of Tver, a source from Ukraine’s Security Service (SBU) told CNN on Wednesday, causing a massive blast.

The Ukrainian drones targeted the Russian defense ministry-operated warehouse in the city of Toropets, which was storing Iskander tactical missile systems, Tochka-U tactical missile systems, guided aerial bombs and artillery ammunition, the source said.

Large fires broke out from the debris of drones repelled by local air defenses, the regional government said, prompting the governor, Igor Rudenya, to order a partial evacuation of the area during the early hours of Wednesday.

Earthquake monitors now believe explosions from the drone attack may have generated seismic activity. Ben Dando, a seismologist at the Norwegian seismology research foundation NORSAR, told CNN that its sensors “detected seismic signals, of magnitude 2.5 to 2.8, in northwest Russia which look to be associated with the drone attack launched by Ukraine.”

NORSAR, which has been using seismic monitors since 2022 to evaluate the impact of the war in Ukraine, is currently analyzing the preliminary data to capture the full extent of the blast, Dando added.

Satellite images taken by Maxar Technologies on Wednesday morning showed huge plumes of smoke rising up from several depot buildings, as well as extensive damage to the buildings and nearby forest.

Fires continue to burn, as seen in the Maxar Technologies images.

Russian state news agency TASS reported that a drone attack had been launched on the city of Toropets overnight causing a fire “due to the fall of debris,” without specifically mentioning any targeting of a weapons facility.

Videos circulating on social media, verified by CNN, showed loud detonations and multiple buildings in the depot complex on fire.

Affected residents, including 11 children, have already been evacuated to the settlements of Kunya and Velikiye Luki in the neighbouring Pskov region, TASS said. No civilians are thought to have been injured in the drone attack, the news agency reported, citing Rudenya.

“Now we are engaged in evacuating the population, residents, maintaining public order,” Rudenya said in a later video statement, stressing that multiple emergency service units were involved in the response.

Rudenya made the call to evacuate so emergency services at the scene could work fully to bring the blazes under control, the local government said in a post on its official Telegram channel.

The Ukrainian security source told CNN that attacks of this nature are being used “methodically” to reduce Russia’s missile potential, adding that plans for further attacks on “similar” Russian military facilities are “proceeding.”

Toropets is located around 300 miles from the Ukrainian border and about 250 miles west of Moscow.

Ukraine has been pushing its key allies, including the United States, to give the go-ahead to carry out missile strikes on targets deeper into Russian territory. Last week, Russian President Vladimir Putin [warned NATO members](https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/12/europe/putin-warns-nato-missiles-hnk-latam-intl/index.html)
 that lifting restrictions on Ukraine’s use of long-range missile systems would mean entering into war with Russia itself.

Tver Oblast Governor Igor Rudenya said on Telegram that a fire had broken out in Toropets caused by falling drone debris but claimed the situation was "under control." He later announced an evacuation of part of the town's population.

Tver was not mentioned in a Russian defense ministry report that 54 drones launched over five regions had been shot down overnight.

Another estimate by George William Herbert of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey in California, was that the blast was consistent with 200-240 tons of high explosives detonating, Reuters reported.

При [бегстве из Балаклеи](https://apostrophe.ua/news/society/2022-09-08/v-balaklee-i-okrestnyih-selah-podnyali-ukrainskie-flagi-foto-i-video/278860)
 в Харьковской области российские оккупанты потеряли очень много живой силы и техники.

Подробности феерического отступления россиян появляются в сети.

Украинский журналист Денис Казанский [опубликовал](https://t.me/kazansky2017/3989)
 красноречивое фото, на котором два бойца ВСУ "селфятся" на фоне лежащего на земле "орка".

"_Теперь уже можно! Балаклея - это Украина!_", - подписан кадр.

![](https://static.apostrophe.ua/uploads/image/d65ce3221fb2320e1df433cbd2684f2e.jpg)

Кроме того, в Балаклее у оккупантов очень большие потери. Россияне драпали так быстро, что [бросали](https://t.me/kazansky2017/3991?single)
 тела погибших сослуживцев.

**Осторожно, жесткие кадры! 18+**

Разгром российской армии в Балаклее стал расплатой за Иловайск в 2014 году, [отмечает](https://t.me/kazansky2017/3994)
 журналист, добавляя, что на дорогах в округе повсюду разбитая и брошенная техника оккупантов.

Еще один украинский журналист Анатолий Цаплиенко [сообщает](https://t.me/Tsaplienko/15021)
, что россияне пробовали убежать, но на дороге их встретила засада украинских бойцов. Чем все закончилось, можно посмотреть на видео.

Напомним, Президент Украины [Владимир Зеленский официально подтвердил освобождение города Балаклеи в Харьковской области от российских оккупантов](https://apostrophe.ua/news/society/2022-09-08/teper-ofitsialno-zelenskiy-podtverdil-osvobojdenie-balaklei-ot-okkupantov/278876)
.

  

##### Президент Зеленский предположил, что война может завершиться в 2026 году. Верите ли вы в это?

Да, это возможно

Нет, сомневаюсь

Трудно сказать

!Оккупанты понесли огромные потери при паническом бегстве из Балаклеи <image:2752>

Многие российские военные попали в засаду.

При бегстве из Балаклеи в Харьковской области российские оккупанты потеряли очень много живой силы и техники.

Подробности феерического отступления россиян появляются в сети, сообщает [«Апостроф»](https://apostrophe.ua/news/society/2022-09-08/rasplata-za-ilovaysk-okkupantyi-ponesli-ogromnyie-poteri-pri-begstve-iz-balaklei-video/278880/)

Украинский журналист **Денис Казанский** опубликовал красноречивое фото, на котором два бойца ВСУ «селфятся» на фоне лежащего на земле оккупанта.

«Теперь уже можно! Балаклея - это Украина!», - подписан кадр.

Кроме того, в Балаклее у оккупантов очень большие потери. Россияне убегали так быстро, что бросали тела погибших сослуживцев.

Разгром российской армии в Балаклее стал расплатой за Иловайск в 2014 году, отмечает журналист, добавляя, что на дорогах в округе повсюду разбитая и брошенная техника оккупантов.

Еще один украинский журналист **Анатолий Цаплиенко** сообщает, что россияне пробовали убежать, но на дороге их встретила засада украинских бойцов. Чем все закончилось, можно посмотреть на видео.

Российские войска отступают. Как развивается украинское контрнаступление и чем успехи ВСУ последних недель грозят России — мнение экспертов и российских военных

Украина [объявила](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1018539645523163)
 о контрнаступлении на юге страны в Херсонской области 29 августа, а 6 сентября начала наступательную операцию на востоке — в Харьковской области. За это время украинская армия освободила десятки населенных пунктов и продвинулась вглубь российских оборонительных позиций. Поступают сообщения о том, что российские войска отступают из стратегически важных городов — Балаклеи, Купянска, Изюма, Волчанска и Лимана.

### **Российские войска не могут держать оборону и бегут**

«8 лет говорили что и когда будут делать: один треп, обо всем со всех щелей. Никакой тактики, никакого профессионализма, никакого ума. Когда на это \[контрнаступление ВСУ\] смотрим мы \[военные\], мы понимаем, что изначально все было сделано неправильно. Но забили на это хуй, начали двигаться дальше криво, коряво. А с другой \[украинской\] стороны, люди просто взяли, увидели это, соорганизовались, все сделали. ‎

Поэтому в плане войны все выглядит очень логично: мы начали как долбоебы, не смогли ничего удержать, всё разъебали, один сплошной пиздеж вокруг, командования ноль, обеспечения ноль, руководства ноль. И вот изначально было понятно, что будет заканчиваться тем, что нас просто разнесут», — комментирует «‎Важным историям»‎ ситуацию на фронте бывший российский военнослужащий, который участвовал в войне в Украине. «Вспоминаю, как долго \[ВС РФ\] ковыряли Мариуполь и Северодонецк, а тут два дня \[понадобилось ВСУ\]. \[При том, что\] Изюм чуть ли не с первых дней войны был под контролем \[российских войск\], то есть они даже не планировали и не думали, что его, возможно, придется оборонять», — недоумевает другой бывший российский военный.

При этом, в [брифинге](https://t.me/mod_russia/19716)
 российского Минобороны от 10 сентября не было сказано ни слова об оставленных российскими войсками городах. Позже Минобороны [объяснило](https://t.me/mod_russia/19719)
 отступление российских войск «операцией по свертыванию и переброске Изюмско-Балаклейской группировки» для наращивания усилий по «освобождению Донбасса».

«Сейчас мы видим, как российские войска бегут, потому что не могут держать оборону», — описывает происходящее украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. Этому предшествовал первый крупный успех ВСУ в Харьковской области — освобождение 8 сентября города Балаклея, который был оккупирован с марта. «Это место, где сосредоточены склады с боеприпасами для артиллерии, поэтому \[ее освобождение\] достаточно серьезно усилит огневые возможности ВСУ», — говорит военный эксперт.

Именно освобождение Балаклеи позволило ВСУ лишить российскую группировку, которая там сконцентрирована, возможности держать оборону, поскольку отрезало их от «логистической артерии» Волчанск-Большой Бурлук-Купянск-Изюм, по которой происходило снабжение армии, объясняет эксперт. «Без снабжения вся эта масса личного состава и техники, сконцентрированная на Изюмском направлении, оказалась бы не боеспособной», — говорит Коваленко.

По словам российского военного эксперта Юрия Федорова, у российских войск на этом направлении «очень крупные потери»: не только убитыми, но и пленными: «как минимум сотни пленных, если не пара тысяч».

Вероятное большое количество пленных подтверждают и двое бывших военнослужащих российской армии. «При спонтанном отступлении особенно много пленных. Связи внутри подразделений нет. Кто где находится, командиры не всегда знают. Соответственно, об отступлении не все могут знать», — говорят они. Бывший военнослужащий одного из элитных подразделений в разговоре с «Важными историями» отметил, что на Харьковском направлении обе стороны несут ощутимые потери. «Когда мои говорят: „Бля, там пиздец“, значит, что всё плохо», — добавил собеседник «Важных историй».

![Контрнаступ Сил оборони України](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201280%20960'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

### **Почему провалилась российская оборона**

Несмотря на то, что в Харьковской области было сконцентрировано больше российских войск, чем задействовано сил ВСУ в контрнаступлении на этом участке, операция была направлена на особо уязвимые места, где возможности российских подразделений по обороне были истощены, говорит украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. «Российское командование знало, что у них есть уязвимые места в Харьковской области, они даже пытались их в значительной степени усилить. Знали, но предотвратить \[исход событий\] не могли: нехватка ресурсов уже начала сказываться на их возможностях по ведению обороны. И сейчас мы наблюдаем каскадный обвал обороны», — объясняет Александр Коваленко.

*   [ЗСУ вже на околицях окупованого Куп’янська](https://cripo.com.ua/news/war/zsu-vzhe-na-okolytsyah-okupovanogo-kup-yanska/ "Permalink to ЗСУ вже на околицях окупованого Куп’янська")
    

Российский военный эксперт Юрий Федоров говорит, что в Харьковской области украинская армия использовала новую тактику, которая и обеспечила успех на этом направлении. «ВСУ действуют очень динамично и фактически не задерживаются на то, чтобы штурмовать те или иные города. Они просто их обходят, берут в кольцо, и тогда гарнизоны этих городков и небольших сел просто вынуждены капитулировать, — рассказывает российский военный эксперт Юрий Федоров.

— Сейчас уже практически взят Купянск, по крайней мере, та часть, которая находится на правом берегу. Сдан Изюм или находится в процессе. Российские войска уходят оттуда, чтобы не попасть в окружение. Это, в общем, разумное решение, потому что коммуникации перерезаны. Сам по себе Изюм находится на стыке двух рек: Оскол и Северский Донец. Если его окружить, скажем, с северо-востока или с севера, то он просто будет отрезан от подвоза боеприпасов и всего прочего, и \[российская армия\] вынуждена будет капитулировать. Чтобы этого не случилось, они просто выводят войска, пока есть возможность».

Юрий Федоров считает, что ВСУ тактически и оперативно переиграли российские войска, которым не хватило ресурсов для сдерживания этого наступления. «\[Сначала\] была прорвана оборона в районе Балаклеи. А затем российские войска были разбросаны гарнизонами по различным городкам, селам. Эти гарнизоны часто состояли из Росгвардии, а также мобилизованных из так называемых народных республик.

Росгвардия в принципе воевать не умеет, она не для этого предназначена. Задача этих гарнизонов и гвардейских полков заключалась в том, чтобы держать в подчинении местное население. А среди мобилизованных многие в первый раз взяли в руки автомат, надели каску, мотивации \[у них нет\] никакой. Российские регулярные части были отведены частично на правобережье в Херсонскую область, частично на Донецкое направление, где они пытались штурмовать пригород Донецка, занятый ВСУ. Поэтому вот такой разгром», — объясняет военный эксперт.

Это же подтверждает в разговоре с «Важными историями» и российский военнослужащий, который был на этом направлении. «\[Подведомственные\] Минобороны \[войска\], группировка Восток, вышли с этого направления еще в июле в Белгородскую область. На тот момент в Изюме я встречал БАРСов (_боевой армейский резерв страны_ — **Прим. ред.**), ополченцев и войска ПВО Западного округа. После \[их\] выхода в Изюм зашёл СОБР и ОМОН. Соответственно, там действительно остались только „БАРСики“, ополченцы и Росгвардия», — говорит он.

По словам эксперта Федорова, российское командование просчиталось в оценке ситуации, когда перебросило боевые части с юга Харьковской области на другие направления до начала контрнаступления. «Считалось, что в районе расположения изюмской группировки ничего страшного случиться не может. Просчет заключался в том, что не была оценена вероятность того, что украинские войска начнут там наступление», — говорит Федоров.

«Российское командование с профессиональной точки зрения оценивают как очень слабое. Это люди, которые умеют бросать в бой значительное количество живой силы, но отсутствует инициатива в исполнении приказа. Написано „занять такой-то перекресток“, а может быть, лучше занять другой перекресток рядышком, но это недопустимая вещь, \[только\] тупое упорное выполнение приказа», — добавляет он.

«Нельзя, чтобы армия, которая строилась двадцать лет, сегодня такая: все, мы будем работать по-другому. Нас заставляли быть тупыми и не принимать никаких решений, — подтверждает бывший военнослужащий российской армии. — Попробуй сержанту скажи, что ты считаешь, что лучше вот так вот. Тебе ебало просто сломают, если не застрелят сразу. И так на всех уровнях. Верховный главнокомандующий принимает только „‎правильные“‎ решения — а все остальные должны их исполнять. И если что, они будут нести наказание, не потому что сверху долбоебы, а потому что „‎вы плохо \[приказы\] исполняете, вы не исполнительные“»‎, — говорит он.

![Український контрнаступ та звільнення міста Балаклія Харківської області та навколишніх сіл](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201280%20960'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

«Самые успешные операции за всю мою службу были те, о которых знали только мы. Только те люди, которые в ней участвуют. Потому что стоит таким заняться командованию… Поэтому когда мы сами решали, что делать, не ожидая команды сверху или пока качнут связь, чтобы уточнить, связаться, запросить разрешение на выполнение, уточнение и прочую херню, мы всегда все выполняли на 100 %», — отмечает бывший военнослужащий одного из элитных подразделений ВС РФ.

Накануне, 9 сентября, Минобороны [показало](https://t.me/mod_russia/19710)
 кадры переброски военной техники в Харьковскую область, но это подкрепление не помогло отстоять города. «Этих подкреплений крайне недостаточно, — говорит Юрий Федоров. — Даже вертолетами перебрасывали личный состав и легкую технику. Но это все равно, что пытаться из пипетки наполнить стакан, практически бессмысленная задача».

Александр Коваленко объясняет это тем, что переброска поддержки была лишь пропагандистским жестом. «Российской армии срочно понадобилось демонстрировать некую активность, что „помощь близка“, „мы своих не бросаем“, якобы они готовы оказывать поддержку тем подразделениям, которые оказались в сложной ситуации. Но эта переброска имела неорганизованный, хаотический характер, она не могла обеспечить никакой поддержки», — говорит эксперт.

По его словам, те подразделения, которые зашли в зону боевых действий для поддержки, были обречены. Многие из них давным-давно требовали ротации или вывода для восстановления боеспособности из-за понесенных до этого серьезных потерь. «В ближайшее время мы будем узнавать о большом количестве подразделений российской армии, которые попросту перестали существовать, поскольку вместо вывода на восстановление боеспособности их кинули в самую мясорубку, самое жерло боевых столкновений», — говорит он.

### **Чем российской армии грозит прорыв ВСУ**

Освобождение Купянска и Изюма важно в стратегическом смысле тем, что оно отрезает российские группировки от путей снабжения и открывает ВСУ путь на Луганское и Донецкое направление, говорит украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. «Эти города важны тем, что они являются неотъемлемой частью логистических артерий поставок техники, материально-технического обеспечения, боеприпасов, личного состава как в Харьковскую область, так и в целом на донбасский плацдарм. Купянск является очень важным логистическим узлом, сердцем этой артерии.

Через него шло обеспечение города Изюм, который стал центром сосредоточения самой большой бронетанковой группы российских оккупантов за все время полномасштабного вторжения в Украину, — говорит эксперт. — И вся эта масса должна была идти в сторону Славянска и Краматорска. Сейчас планы по захвату Славянска и Краматорска можно считать аннулированными. Потеря \[российской армией\] таких населенных пунктов как Купянск и Изюм полностью рушит систему обеспечения донбасского плацдарма и позволяет ВСУ в дальнейшем развивать контрнаступательные действия уже не только в Харьковской области, но и в Луганском и Донецком направлениях».

В ближайшие дни можно ожидать, что Харьковская область будет освобождена, уверен российский военный эксперт Юрий Федоров. «Это не решающее сражение, но очень крупный успех ВСУ», — говорит он. По его словам, тогда вооруженные силы Украины смогут перебросить значительное количество личного состава и на другие направления.

![У центрі звільненої Балаклії вже встановлено прапор України](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20960%20702'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Херсонская область
------------------

### **Российской армии не хватает сил для обороны**

Еще одно не менее важное направление, на котором продолжают наступать силы ВСУ, — контролируемый российскими войсками плацдарм на правом берегу Днепра в Херсонской области. Украинское контрнаступление началось там 29 августа. В тот день, по [данным](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1018539645523163)
 оперативной группировки ВСУ «Каховка», ей удалось «прорвать первую линию обороны» в Херсонской области. «109 полк „ДНР“ отошел со своих позиций, российские десантники, которые были их поддержкой, сбежали с поля боя», — [говорилось](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1018539645523163)
 в сообщении. 4 сентября ВСУ [установили](https://www.facebook.com/kirill.timoshenko/posts/5588117717898633)
 украинский флаг в крупном населенном пункте Высокополье.

Точная численность российской группировки, которая находится на правом берегу Днепра, где Украина ведет контрнаступление, неизвестна. По разным оценкам, на начало контрнаступления там находилось от [20](https://www.currenttime.tv/a/ukraine-russia-war-kherson/31989285.html)
 до [25 тысяч](https://www.currenttime.tv/a/32011307.html)
 российских военных. Нет точных данных и о численности украинской группировки. Источник «Важных историй» из числа бывших сотрудников российской спецслужбы, пожелавший остаться анонимным, говорит, что для контрнаступления в Херсонской области Украина сформировала «довольно скромные резервы»: их численность — 10–12 тысяч человек.

Однако, по его словам, у Украины есть еще резервы, не брошенные в контрнаступление, которые не должны позволить российской стороне замкнуть окружение вокруг прорвавшихся вперед войск. Максимальную оценку украинских сил на этом фронте [приводит](https://www.currenttime.tv/a/rf-boitsya-poteryat-litso-i-poetomu-otdaet-svoih-soldat-na-myaso-na-pravom-beregu-dnepra-eksperty-o-rasklade-sil-na-yuge-ukrainy-/32011763.html)
 украинский военный эксперт Роман Свитан: по его данным, там находится 30 тысяч бойцов ВСУ.

![Зеленым цветом обозначены освобожденные территории, красным — оккупированные территории Источник: Украинский проект deepstatemap. Последнее обновление: 10 сентября, 18:23](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%20703'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

«Теми силами, которые присутствуют сейчас на правом берегу Днепра, российская армия в среднесрочной перспективе не сможет удерживать контрнаступление ВСУ», — уверен украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. По словам аналитика Conflict Intelligence Team (CIT) Кирилла Михайлова, ВСУ удалось создать определенное превосходство в численности личного состава на основных направлениях наступления в Херсонской области. «К этому добавляется эффективная работа артиллерии и локальное превосходство Украины в воздухе, которое позволяет использовать как фронтовую авиацию, так и ударные беспилотники», — комментирует он расстановку сил.

По его словам, сейчас украинцы наступают в Херсонской области как минимум на трех направлениях: с запада; северо-запада, где они расширяют плацдарм на оккупированном \[Россией\] берегу реки Ингулец; и с севера, где им удалось взять крупный населенный пункт Высокополье и «затрофеить» большое количество военной техники российского десанта. На сегодня украинской армии удалось продвинуться на территорию более десяти населенных пунктов в Херсонской области, говорит Михайлов. «Хоть эти населенные пункты и небольшие, они являются оборонительными узлами. Пока мы видим преимущество на украинской стороне», — говорит он.

Нехватку ресурсов у российской группировки на этом направлении подтверждает и бывший сотрудник российской спецслужбы. «Из-за нехватки солдат и офицеров российские войска на фронте сосредоточены в недостаточном количестве. Людей примерно в три раза меньше, чем нужно для выполнения поставленных задач: требуется минимум одна батальонно-тактическая группа на 3 километра, а у России — одна на 5 километров. Такой численностью не наступают, это похоже на авантюру, — говорит он. — Прорвав первую линию \[обороны\] российских войск, украинское наступление должно было упереться во вторую линию, но проблема в том, что у российской военной группировки ее нет: из-за нехватки людей такие прорывы затыкают лишь мобильными резервами. И это может сделать ситуацию непредсказуемой».

Достоверных данных о потерях обеих сторон в этой схватке сейчас нет, говорит аналитик CIT Кирилл Михайлов, но судя по [публикации](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/09/04/ukraine-is-losing-fewer-soldiers-in-its-counter-offensive-than-russia-claims)
 The Economist (журналисты побывали в прифронтовом городе Николаеве, поговорили с местными врачами и не увидели там «переполненных моргов» с погибшими украинскими военными, о чем утверждает российская сторона), хоть потери украинской армии выросли с началом наступления, они не катастрофические, как это заявляет российское Минобороны. По словам бывшего сотрудника российской спецслужбы, с которым поговорили «Важные истории», потери украинской стороны высоки, потому что наступающая сторона всегда теряет больше обороняющейся.

На третий день контрнаступления в Херсонской области The Wall Street Journal [поговорила](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ukrainian-soldiers-say-they-are-advancing-in-the-south-but-at-a-cost-11661983338)
 в госпитале с ранеными украинскими солдатами, которые участвовали в операции. По их словам, бои на пути к Херсону идут крайне ожесточенные, но украинские войска продвигаются вперед. «У них много техники, но мало людей», — сказал один из украинских военных. Кроме этого, они утверждают, что некоторые российские солдаты бегут со своих позиций, бросая технику и устанавливая мины на телах погибших товарищей.

По словам одного из российских военнослужащих, который сейчас находится в Херсонской области, российская армия там находится в тяжелом положении, солдаты массово пытаются уволиться. «Две недели назад командиры нам сказали, что на нас наступление идет. А нам даже боеприпасы никак не привезти, потому что дамба разбита (_вероятно, речь идет о дамбе в Новой Каховке_ — **Прим. ред.**). Люди каждый день ходят с рапортами \[на увольнение\], но почти всем их разрывают», — написал он. Спустя две недели военный передал «Важным историям», что при обстреле чудом выжил, и «там все жестко».

Другой источник, близкий к российским военнослужащим, которые находятся на Херсонском направлении, передал, что солдаты в полном шоке, «никто ничего не понимает, гибнут пачками, потери ужасные. Некоторые вообще звонят, прощаются, мы, говорят, смертники ебучие».

### **У российской армии проблемы со снабжением**

Еще одна проблема российской группировки, которая должна сдерживать прорыв украинской армии в Херсонской области, заключается в том, что она оказалась отрезанной от всех основных путей снабжения. Ранее снабжение российской группировки на правом берегу Днепра происходило через мосты, по которым везли боеприпасы, технику, топливо и продовольствие с левого берега реки. Однако в результате ударов ВСУ все стационарные мосты через Днепр были выведены из строя, понтонные и паромные переправы постоянно подвергаются обстрелам.

«\[Исход этого противостояния на правом берегу Днепра\] зависит от того, удастся ли россиянам организовать поставки \[снабжения\] паромами, поскольку все постоянные мосты перестали функционировать. Наладить понтонные переправы через Днепр \[российской армии\] не удалось. Сейчас функционирует несколько паромных переправ — их украинцам тяжелее поражать, чем мосты, потому что паромы мобильны, сложно предугадать, где они находятся.

Однако периодически украинцы пытаются поражать скопление российской техники в местах ожидания паромов. Это должно вызывать значительные проблемы со снабжением. Насколько россиянам хватит ресурсов для противостояния, зависит от того, смогут ли они эффективно перебрасывать подкрепление, а также от того, сколько продержатся силы ВДВ, пока у них не закончится техника, которая не отличается бронированностью», — говорит аналитик CIT Кирилл Михайлов.

### **Чем России грозит продвижение ВСУ** 

Освобождение украинскими войсками населенного пункта Высокополье в Херсонской области 4 сентября сделало невозможным для российской армии ведение наступательных действий в направлении Кривого Рога в Днепропетровской области, говорит украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. «Это была крайняя северная точка, откуда россияне могли развернуть наступательную операцию в Криворожском направлении. В настоящее время эти возможности у них отсутствуют, — объясняет он.

— Кроме того, благодаря Высокополью ВСУ получили возможность расширить плацдарм в правобережной части Херсонской области и сформировать условия для контрнаступления на достаточно угрожающем участке для многих подразделений ВС РФ. Если ВСУ будут достаточно успешно развивать наступательные действия, то мы сможем говорить о том, что огромное количество российских подразделений может оказаться фактически в окружении».

Стратегический и политический смысл операции на Херсонском направлении для Украины в том, чтобы разгромить российскую группировку на правом берегу Днепра и освободить Херсон, считает аналитик CIT Кирилл Михайлов. «Это позволит задействовать экономические ресурсы области, а также продемонстрировать западным партнерам Украины \[поставщикам оружия\], что страна в состоянии наступать и выигрывать — нужно только больше \[поставок\] оружия.

Кроме этого, в долгосрочной перспективе ликвидация правобережного плацдарма устраняет перспективу наступления \[российской армии\] на Николаев, Кривой Рог и Одессу, потому что именно захват мостов и выход на правый берег Днепра был самым значительным успехом россиян на первом этапе операции. Ликвидация этого плацдарма сильно снижает угрозу всей правобережной Украине, в том числе западному Черноморью, которое критически важно для Украины с точки зрения, например, экспорта сельхозпродукции», — объясняет эксперт значимость операции на этом направлении.

Где еще наступают ВСУ и какая битва будет решающей
--------------------------------------------------

Кроме Херсонской и Харьковской областей, ВСУ осуществляют наступательные действия в Донецкой области, говорит украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. В частности освобожден населенный пункт Озерное в Донецкой области. «Аналогичные новости будут поступать и из Луганской области, где значительно активизировались ВСУ, воспользовавшись ослаблением российских подразделений после достаточно продолжительного воздействия на них огневым потенциалом», — уверен эксперт.

По мнению Коваленко, решающей для этой войны битвой станет контрнаступление украинской армии в Запорожской области. «Битва за правобережную Херсонщину — это очень важный промежуточный этап. После ее завершения и освобождения Херсона будет освобождена и значительная часть ресурсов ВСУ, которые были задействованы для сдерживания российских оккупантов и для ведения этой контрнаступательной операции. И эти ресурсы могут быть использованы на других направлениях: Запорожской, Харьковской, Донецкой и Луганской областях.

Они сыграют решающую роль в значительном ускорении, увеличении активности и интенсивности действий ВСУ. Для командования российских войск очень важно сохранять контроль именно над Запорожской областью. Ее потеря для россиян — это фактически выстрел в висок, поскольку это станет потерей всего юга, а потеря всего юга — это и потеря Крыма. Выйдя в Запорожскую область, ВСУ получат возможность блокировать Крым с материковой части Украины и нанести удары по Керченскому мосту — то есть отрезать его от материковой части России и начать операцию по освобождению Крыма», — говорит он.

«Что война проиграна, можно было легко судить, когда не получилось взять Киев. Плюс сейчас начинается слякоть, холода, потом зима. И такие простые вещи как теплая одежда, нормальная обувь и место для ночлега, будут влиять как на на здоровье, так и на отношение людей на фронте к войне, — говорит бывший российский военный. — Это трагичный конец, которого мы и ожидали. Война работает в обе стороны: за что боролись, на то и напоролись. В наше руководство я не верю, конечно. Как родина нас кидает, мы и так знаем. Уже кинула, начиная с 14-го \[года\] — заканчивая сегодня. Сами это дерьмо устроили, естественно, мы охуеть как насосемся теперь. Проблема в том, что мы изначально на проигравшей и некомпетентной стороне были. Родина сначала кинула мясом, а теперь бросила умирать. И у этого нет ни цели, ни мотива, никакой пользы никому — ни единому человеку».

Experts told _Newsweek_ that, even if an American PMC were operational in Kursk, it would not equate to Ukraine's raid being conducted under the direction or patronage of the Biden administration, as alleged by the Foreign Ministry.

Helene Olsen, a lecturer in defense studies at King's College London and an expert in the usa of mercenaries and other forms of private contractors in conflict, told _Newsweek_ that it is in the nature of PMCs to "go where the money is."

"While American PMCs traditionally have worked closely with the US Gov and many American PMCs have interests that align with the US Gov, PMCs, irrespective of origin, are ultimately businesses," Olsen said, adding that Russia "would benefit from making up these allegations considering the stigma connected with the private military industry."

According to a release on its website, the ministry expressed its "strong protest" to Holmes "in connection with provocative actions of American reporters who illegally infiltrated Kursk Oblast for propagandist reporting of crimes of Kyiv's regime."

The ministry also claimed to have seen evidence "of the participation of an American \[private military company\] on the side of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the invasion of the territory of the Russian Federation."

According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, however, the involvement of an American PMC in these operations ran "counter to the Biden administration's assertions that it was allegedly not involved in the attack by Ukrainian neo-Nazis on Russia" and that this proved "the United States, as a direct participant in the conflict, is involved in Vladimir Zelensky's malicious plans."

The ministry went on to say that an investigation would be launched into the "American citizens involved in these crimes." It added that those who cross over into Russian territory "automatically become a legitimate military target for the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation."

Eugenio Cusumano, associate professor of political science at the University of Messina, Italy, believes that Russia's allegations of American PMC presence in Kursk is "rather unlikely."

"Russia has repeatedly stated [NATO](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/nato)
 soldiers were fighting in Ukraine, German tanks with German crews were captured, a NATO biolab was found under Mariupol, all with no evidence," Cusumano told _Newsweek_.

Even if proven true, he added that the "the scale and impact of US contractors' involvement is most likely minimal," and that the presence of "a private firm serving private objectives" would not constitute America's direct involvement in Kursk.

Keir Giles, senior research fellow at Chatham House's Russia & Eurasia Program, was less skeptical of the Foreign Ministry's claim, given that "large numbers of foreign volunteers are fighting alongside and supporting Ukrainian forces, Americans among them."

*   Russian Foreign Ministry summons US Charge d'affaires in Moscow Stephanie Holmes to convey strong protest against 'provocative actions of American reporters' and 'participation of the American PMCs'   

**MOSCOW** 

Russia protested on Tuesday that US private military companies (PMCs) are fighting alongside Ukraine in the Kursk region, while reporters from several major American media outlets illegally entered Russian territory to cover the incursion. 

The Russian Foreign Ministry claimed in a statement that soldiers from US private military companies are fighting alongside Ukrainian troops in the Kursk region, and journalists illegally entered Russian territory to cover the incursion.

US Charge d'affaires Stephanie Holmes was summoned to the Foreign Ministry in Moscow to convey strong protest against the "provocative actions of American reporters" and "participation of the American PMCs on the side of Ukraine's armed forces during their invasion" of Russia, it said.

"Such actions are contradicting statements by Joe Biden administration about non-involvement in Ukraine's neo-Nazi attack against Russia, proving with all clarity US involvement as a direct participant of the conflict in (Ukraine's President Volodymyr) Zelenskyy's malicious intentions," the ministry stressed.

The ministry warned that Russian law enforcement will investigate US citizens’ actions and take necessary measures to bring them to justice.

"All foreign 'specialists' and mercenaries illegally crossing the border of our country automatically become a legitimate military target for the armed forces of the Russian Federation," it said.

Kyiv's incursion into the Kursk region began on the night of August 5-6, when Ukrainian forces entered near Sudzha. **Please contact us for subscription options.**](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/p/subscription/1001)

However, Russian President Vladimir Putin denounced the incursion as a "terrorist attack."

The Russian Ministry of Emergency Situations reported that over 121,000 people have been evacuated from the combat zone.

### Evidence from `web_search`
Newsweek reports that Russia claimed the presence of American mercenaries in the Kursk region during Ukraine's incursion in August 2024 (<image:3404>, <image:3401>, <image:3403>). The Russian Foreign Ministry protested to the U.S. and stated that those involved would be considered legitimate military targets. Experts suggest that even if American PMCs were present, it wouldn't necessarily mean the U.S. government directed the raid.

The Anadolu Agency also reported on August 20, 2024, that Russia protested the participation of US mercenaries fighting alongside Ukraine in the Kursk region (<image:i>).

Ukraine's cross-border incursion into Russia has disrupted Russian mercenaries' plans in junta-led Burkina Faso, with many now pulled out to help boost Moscow's defenses back home, a paramilitary commander said on Friday.

In an interview with AFP, Viktor Yermolaev, head of a paramilitary unit known as Medvedi (Bears) in Russia and the Bear Brigade in the West, said many of his fighters had left the West African country, while some stayed behind.

Ukraine earlier this month launched the unprecedented incursion into Russia's western Kursk region, adding a new factor in the over two year war that began in February 2022 with Moscow's invasion of its neighbor.

The Bear Brigade is one of several such mercenary groups that emerged in recent years alongside the now defunct Wagner Group of the late Yevgeny Prigozhin and Western analysts say are closely linked to the Russian state.

"We thought Ukrainians wanted to end this war and sit down at the negotiating table, but after their entry into the Kursk region we see that they chose the path of war, and war is our job," said Yermolaev, who is also known by his call sign Jedi.

"There is no higher honor for a Russian warrior than to defend his homeland. <image:13714>\

He said he was now in Russia but declined to provide further details or say how many fighters had been pulled out.

The unit's Telegram channel said earlier this week that "due to recent events" the unit was returning to Crimea, the Ukrainian Black Sea peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014, where it is based.

A Western security source told AFP that around 100 fighters of the paramilitary unit had left Burkina Faso.

Western intelligence believes that the fighters have been tasked in particular with providing security for the country's junta leader Ibrahim Traore who took power in 2022.

A succession of coups in francophone western Africa — in Mali in 2021, Burkina Faso in 2022 and Niger in 2023 — has led to a drastic increase in Russia's influence as Russian mercenaries were called in to prop up new regimes.

Coup leaders in Burkina Faso expelled troops and diplomats from former colonial ruler France and turned to Russia for military assistance.

'Limited impact on the ground'
------------------------------

Yermolaev declined to discuss their operations in Burkina Faso, but said there were around 300 Bear Brigade fighters in the African country before the Kursk incursion.

"Some are remaining of course, we have bases and property, equipment and ammunition, we're not taking all that to Russia."

One picture circulating on social media shows Yermolaev, shaven-headed and with a salt-and-pepper beard, smiling and clasping Traore's hand. They haven't taken on the level of risk that Wagner units have in places like Mali," Margolin, who is based in Washington DC, told AFP on Friday.

"Bears are just one part of how the Russian military has deployed to Burkina Faso, and it's likely that Russia will maintain a presence through other units — whether more formal, or others like Bears," he added.

Lou Osborn of the All Eyes on Wagner monitor described the unit as a "group of volunteers" whose members had signed a contract with Russia's GRU military intelligence service.

Wagner, Russia's most notorious mercenary group, was disbanded and reorganized following the death of its leader Prigozhin in a mysterious plane crash last year following an aborted mutiny.

Russian security operations in Africa are now coordinated through an umbrella group known as the Africa Corps.

What now for Ukraine's offensive?
---------------------------------

Ukraine's top general, Oleksandr Syrskyi, insists that Ukrainian forces have pulled back to "more favourable positions", remain in Kursk, and would do so "for as long as it is expedient and necessary".

He said Russia had suffered more than 50,000 losses during the operation - including those killed, injured or captured.

However, the situation now is very different to last August. But this again came as a surprise to our command."

At the time of writing, just before Russia retook Sudzha, Volodymyr said Ukrainian forces were being pressed from three sides.

Maksym: Vehicle wrecks litter the roads
---------------------------------------

By 11 March, Ukrainian forces were battling to prevent the road being cut, according to Telegram messages from "Maksym".

"A few days ago, we received an order to leave the defence lines in an organised retreat," he said, adding that Russia had amassed a significant force to retake the town, "including large numbers of North Korean soldiers".

Military experts estimate Russia had amassed a force of up to 70,000 troops to retake Kursk – including about 12,000 North Koreans.

Russia had also sent its best drone units to the front and was using kamikaze and first-person-view (FPV) variants to "take fire control of the main logistics routes".

They included drones linked to operators by fibre-optic wires - which are impossible to jam with electronic counter-measures.

Maksym said as a result "the enemy managed to destroy dozens of units of equipment", and that wrecks had "created congestion on supply routes".

! On 13 March, Russia said the situation in Kursk was "fully under our control" and that Ukraine had "abandoned" much of its material.

Dmytro: Inches from death
-------------------------

In social media posts on 11-12 March, a fourth soldier, "Dmytro" likened the retreat from the front to "a scene from a horror movie".

"The roads are littered with hundreds of destroyed cars, armoured vehicles and ATVs (All Terrain Vehicles). Military analysts estimate two-thirds of the 1,000 sq km gained at the outset have since been lost.

Any hopes that Ukraine would be able to trade Kursk territory for some of its own have significantly diminished.

Last week, President Volodymyr Zelensky said he believed the Kursk operation had "accomplished its task" by forcing Russia to pull troops from the east and relieve pressure on Pokrovsk.

But it is not yet clear at what cost.

Ukrainian soldiers fighting in Russia's Kursk region have described scenes "like a horror movie" as they retreated from the front lines.

The BBC has received extensive accounts from Ukrainian troops, who recount a "catastrophic" withdrawal in the face of heavy fire, and columns of military equipment destroyed and constant attacks from swarms of Russian drones.

The soldiers, who spoke over social media, were given aliases to protect their identity. <image:13715>!EPA Ukrainian forces travel towards the Kursk region on a supply route in Sumy last August. <image:13720>EPA

Ukrainian forces travel towards the Kursk region on a supply route in Sumy last August. By March of this year, their retreat was in full swing.

* information that might be useful for the fact-check (see Record)
* relevant images (refer to images by inserting their reference <image:k>)
* if available: the release date as well as the author or the publisher (e.g. the media company) of the search result.

Do NOT include:
* advertisements
* any other information not related to the Record or the Claim

Additional rules:
* Do not add any additional information besides the information in the Search Result.
* If the Search Result doesn't contain any relevant information for the fact-checking work, simply print one word in capital letters: "NONE".
* Keep your writing style like in the Examples 1, 2 and 3 provided to you.
* Try to filter out relevant information even if the search result is in a different language.

# Example 1
The search result from America Today provides several photographs of the Notre-Dame Cathedral fire on April 15, 2019. <image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>. None of the images show the Eiffel Tower in the background. 

# Example 2

The Guardian mentions the Chemical Weapons Convention and the responsibilities of Syria under the convention. According to The Guardian, The White House condemned the Assad regime for defying the norm against chemical weapons use.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:24> This image shows American mercenaries participating in Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:24>)
web_search("American mercenaries Ukraine Kursk Oblast August 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:24>

### Evidence from `web_search`
Newsweek reports that Russia claimed the presence of American mercenaries in the Kursk region during Ukraine's incursion in August 2024 (<image:3404>, <image:3401>, <image:3403>). The Russian Foreign Ministry protested to the U.S. and stated that those involved would be considered legitimate military targets. Experts suggest that even if American PMCs were present, it wouldn't necessarily mean the U.S. government directed the raid.

The Anadolu Agency also reported on August 20, 2024, that Russia protested the participation of US mercenaries fighting alongside Ukraine in the Kursk region (<image:i>).

## Elaboration
The claim is partially supported by the evidence. Newsweek and the Anadolu Agency report that Russia protested the presence of American mercenaries in the Kursk region during Ukraine's incursion in August 2024. The image shows individuals with American flags on their uniforms. However, the evidence does not confirm that the individuals in the image are mercenaries or that they participated in the incursion.

## Elaboration
The claim is partially supported. The evidence confirms that Russia claimed the presence of American mercenaries in the Kursk region during the Ukrainian incursion in August 2024. The image shows individuals with American flags on their uniforms, which aligns with the claim. However, the evidence does not definitively prove that the individuals in the image are mercenaries or that they participated in the incursion.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:24> This image shows American mercenaries participating in Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:24>)
web_search("American mercenaries Ukraine Kursk Oblast August 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:24>

### Evidence from `web_search`
Newsweek reports that Russia claimed the presence of American mercenaries in the Kursk region during Ukraine's incursion in August 2024 (<image:3404>, <image:3401>, <image:3403>). The Russian Foreign Ministry protested to the U.S. and stated that those involved would be considered legitimate military targets. Experts suggest that even if American PMCs were present, it wouldn't necessarily mean the U.S. government directed the raid.

The Anadolu Agency also reported on August 20, 2024, that Russia protested the participation of US mercenaries fighting alongside Ukraine in the Kursk region (<image:i>).

## Elaboration
The claim is partially supported by the evidence. Newsweek and the Anadolu Agency report that Russia protested the presence of American mercenaries in the Kursk region during Ukraine's incursion in August 2024. The image shows individuals with American flags on their uniforms. However, the evidence does not confirm that the individuals in the image are mercenaries or that they participated in the incursion.


## Actions
```
image_search("American flag military uniform Ukraine Russia")
web_search("Ukraine Russia Kursk Oblast August 2024 mercenaries")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The New York Times published an article on May 28, 2025, about a military simulation in Oklahoma (<image:13706>). The American Legion website features an article about American veterans in Ukraine training front-line medics (<image:13708>).


### Evidence from `web_search`
The Moscow Times reports that Russian mercenaries were pulled from Burkina Faso to defend the Kursk region in August 2024, referencing the Ukrainian incursion. The BBC discusses the retreat of Ukrainian troops from the Kursk region, mentioning fighting in August 2024 and including images of the area. The Wikipedia article on the 2024 Kursk offensive, which began on August 6, 2024, notes that Russia claimed the presence of American mercenaries.

## Elaboration
The claim is partially supported. The evidence confirms that Russia claimed the presence of American mercenaries in the Kursk region during the Ukrainian incursion in August 2024. The image shows individuals with American flags on their uniforms, which aligns with the claim. However, the evidence does not definitively prove that the individuals in the image are mercenaries or that they participated in the incursion.

Content: "To commemorate the republic's victory over the Red Army, Minister of Military Affairs [Stanisław Szeptycki](/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Szeptycki "Stanisław Szeptycki")
 established the Feast of the Soldier (_Święta Żołnierza_), or Soldiers Day, in 1923.[\[4\]](#cite_note-4)
 In proclaiming the holiday, Szeptycki declared that, "\[o\]n the anniversary of the memorable defeat of the Bolshevik onslaught on Warsaw, we honor the memory of those killed in battles with enemies throughout all ages and for Polish independence."[\[5\]](#cite_note-Museum-5)
 The date of 15 August was chosen as it coincided with the [21st Mountain Division's](/wiki/21st_Mountain_Infantry_Division_(Poland) "21st Mountain Infantry Division (Poland)")
 evening counterattack on Russian troops, eventually forcing the Red Army's general retreat.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Kontakt24-2)
 Additionally, the government of the Second Republic desired the military's greater integration with the new state, as well as for the armed forces to improve its image among the civilian public.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Kontakt24-2)

The Feast of the Soldier remained a celebrated holiday until 1947, when the newly installed communist government of the [People's Republic of Poland](/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_Poland "People's Republic of Poland")
 discontinued the tradition.[\[6\]](#cite_note-Gazeta2013-6)
 In 1950, the [Council of Ministers](/wiki/Cabinet_of_Poland "Cabinet of Poland")

 passed regulations to officially celebrate the military on 12 October.[\[7\]](#cite_note-DzU1950-7)
 Renaming the celebration as Polish Armed Forces Day (_Dzień Wojska Polskiego_), the day marked the anniversary of the Soviet-organized [Polish 1st Tadeusz Kościuszko Infantry Division](/wiki/Polish_1st_Tadeusz_Ko%C5%9Bciuszko_Infantry_Division "Polish 1st Tadeusz Kościuszko Infantry Division")

 Following the return of democracy in the wake of the [events of 1989](/wiki/Revolutions_of_1989 "Revolutions of 1989")

WARSAW, Poland (AP) — NATO member Poland paid tribute Thursday to its historic 1920 victory over the Red Army by honoring fallen Poles and showing off modern tanks and other equipment that it hopes will deter [the threat it sees in modern-day Russia](https://apnews.com/article/poland-self-defense-security-ukraine-russia-war-06569fdb6f4792fd0b919a24e1d6bef1)
.

More than 2,500 Polish troops, joined by dozens of U.S. Since Poland broke free of Moscow’s control starting in 1989 and then joined NATO, it has worked to modernize its army.

Those efforts moved into higher gear after Russia, under President Vladimir Putin, first invaded parts of Ukraine in 2014, and then began its full-fledged assault in 2022, with fears heightened all along the strategic stretch of NATO’s eastern flank — from the Baltic nations to Poland to Romania.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim that the image shows a military parade on August 14, 2024, is inaccurate. The evidence indicates that the parade took place on August 15, 2024, as part of Poland's Armed Forces Day. The parade commemorates the victory over Soviet Russia.

The evidence does not support the claim that the parade was preparing for war with Russia.
