Farid said a model trained to distinguish real pictures from those created by artificial intelligence uncovered no signs of AI generation, either. But he added that he could not rule out whether the toys had been propped up or otherwise staged for dramatic effect.

Anton Hrushetskyi, director of KIIS, told Reuters that while similar, trust and approval are not identical concepts. He said a person can approve of someone's activities, but that does not necessarily mean that they trust them.
Olga Onuch, a professor in comparative and Ukrainian politics at the University of Manchester who worked with KIIS to produce the surveys, said in a statement on Wednesday, opens new tab: “Trump’s claim is not only factually incorrect, but also irresponsible and anti-democratic - Zelenskiy remains a fairly popular political leader in Ukraine.

As of this writing, the United States had allocated nearly $183 billion for the response to Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, according to the U.S. government's inspector general overseeing the situation. That amount includes more than just what the U.S. government directly sent to Ukraine — and only $83 billion had actually been paid out as of December 2024. Thus, we rate this claim false."

","The Ukrainian president submitted a 2024 asset declaration to the National Agency on Corruption Prevention covering 2023 that detailed his owned properties, income, bank accounts and vehicles. The NACP is a Ukrainian government unit that takes asset declarations from all politicians who receive a salary from the state. 
According to the declaration, Zelenskyy owned fewer than 15 properties, none of them in the U.S., owned no planes and had an annual income of around $300,000, equivalent to about $25,000 per month. Records searches in Florida's 67 counties revealed no properties in Zelenskyy's name.
The declaration listed just one overseas bank account holding 350,272 euros (around $377,000). Given the above, we rate this claim false."

While there is evidence of Volodymyr Zelenskyy's visit to Scranton, Pennsylvania, in September 2024, and that Republicans viewed it as a campaign event for Kamala Harris, there is no direct evidence that Zelenskyy was actively campaigning for Harris. The visit, however, led to an investigation by House Republicans, who also viewed it as a campaign stop.
","A Facebook post said Zelenskyy ""engaged in election interference by campaigning"" in Pennsylvania for Harris.
In September 2024, Zelenskyy visited a Scranton ammunition plant to thank its workers who were producing munitions for Ukraine. A video of his visit shows Zelenskyy touring the site and thanking workers.
Although Shapiro served as a Harris campaign surrogate, he attended the Scranton event in his official capacity as governor. Harris did not attend the Scranton event. Zelenskyy met with Harris and Trump separately later the same week.
Zelenskyy’s visit to the Scranton plant was not covert, and experts said it doesn’t meet any definition of foreign election interference.

In the video, Scholz said, “The Bundestag should pass a resolution as soon as possible according to which the war in Ukraine and its serious consequences for the security of Germany and Europe are classified as an emergency (Notlage) within the meaning of Article 115 paragraph two of the Basic Law.” In German, “Notstand” means a state of emergency that would severely restrict citizens’ rights.

Trump said last month that 1.7 million soldiers across both sides had been killed, as reported by Politico, for which there is no evidence. Even though he went on to say that he was ""interested primarily from the standpoint of death,"" Newsweek assessed the total of wounded and killed. A November 2024 report by the French Institute of International Relations referenced British military intelligence that said that as of May 2024, Russia's killed and wounded was up to 500,000. Using data from other conflicts to estimate the amount of Russian irreversible losses (those killed, wounded who died in hospital, or otherwise immobilized), the report suggested total irreversible Russian casualties in Ukraine by mid-summer 2024 had reached around 460,000. In December 2024, the U.K. Minister for the Armed Forces, Luke Pollard MP, told the U.K. Parliament's House of Commons: ""Our assessments further indicate there have been over 750,000 Russian casualties since the beginning of the full-scale invasion with the grim milestone of one million Russians dead and wounded likely to be reached within approximately six months."" Global security experts at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) said in a report published this week that, as of early January 2025, it estimated a minimum of 172,000 Russian troops had been killed, with 611,000 wounded, of whom 376,000 were severely wounded. Recruitment since the start of the war had generated approximately 976,000 personnel, it said, adding that up to an accumulated 235,000 Russian wounded were ""recoverable."" Recent estimates published by Ukraine's military say that as of February 10, 2025, Russian casualties had reached 850,490. While larger, its total isn't far from independent experts and government reports, with recent Ukrainian analyses echoing experts outside Kyiv. For example, the IISS's estimate of 783,000 from early January 2025 was, by its own words, a ""minimum"" approximate and, as noted by defense-industry specialist magazine Defense Express, was roughly in line with the Ukrainian military estimate published in late December 2024 of 789,550."
