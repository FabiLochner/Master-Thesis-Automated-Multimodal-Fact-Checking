## Actions
```
reverse_search(![image 22](media/73.jpg))
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (![image 22](media/73.jpg)) shows the wreckage of an F-16 that crashed into a warehouse in May 2019. The crash occurred near March Air Reserve Base due to improperly installed parts and hydraulic failure. The pilot ejected and survived. The Press-Enterprise published an article on May 1, 2020, about the crash, and the missiles on board did not explode because they were not armed.

## Elaboration
The image depicts the wreckage of an F-16 fighter jet that crashed in May 2019 near March Air Reserve Base due to mechanical failure. The pilot ejected safely. The claim that the image shows a Ukrainian F-16 shot down by Russia during the invasion is false.


## Final Judgement
The image shows an F-16 that crashed in 2019 due to mechanical failure, not a Ukrainian F-16 shot down by Russia. The claim misrepresents the origin and context of the image.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image depicts a 2019 crash of an F-16 near March Air Reserve Base due to mechanical failure, not a Ukrainian F-16 shot down by Russia as claimed. The pilot ejected safely, and the missiles did not explode, as reported by the [Press-Enterprise](https://www.pressenterprise.com/2020/05/01/heres-why-the-missiles-on-the-crashed-f-16-near-march-air-reserve-base-did-not-explode/).
