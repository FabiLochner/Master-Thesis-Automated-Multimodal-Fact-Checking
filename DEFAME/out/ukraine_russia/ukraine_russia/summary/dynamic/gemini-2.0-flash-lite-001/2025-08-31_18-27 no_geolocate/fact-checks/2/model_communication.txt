Trump slams Zelenskyy on Truth Social for saying the end of the Russia war ‘is still very, very far away’
=========================================================================================================

[Politics](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics)
 Mar 3, 2025 1:01 PM EDT

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump slammed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Monday for suggesting that the end of Russia’s war against Ukraine is still likely “very, very far away.”

[**READ MORE:** Fact-checking Trump and Vance’s attacks on Ukrainian President Zelenskyy](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/fact-checking-trump-and-vances-attacks-on-ukrainian-president-zelenskyy)

“This is the worst statement that could have been made by Zelenskyy, and America will not put up with it for much longer!” Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform.

Zelenskyy late Sunday said he believed the war would go on for some time, while trying to offer a positive take about the U.S.-Ukraine relationship in the aftermath of his [contentious White House meeting](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/in-clash-with-zelenskyy-trump-deepens-diplomatic-rift-over-russias-war-in-ukraine)
 with the Republican president and Vice President JD Vance.

“I think our relationship (with the U.S.) will continue, because it’s more than an occasional relationship,” Zelenskyy said, referring to Washington’s support for the past three years of war.

But Trump seemed further irritated by Zelenskyy’s latest comments suggesting it will take time for the three-year conflict to come to a close.

“It is what I was saying, this guy doesn’t want there to be Peace as long as he has America’s backing and, Europe, in the meeting they had with Zelenskyy, stated flatly that they cannot do the job without the U.S. “What are they thinking?”

We're not going anywhere.

A potential deal between the United States and Ukraine intended to pave the way for an end to the war with Russia was up in the air Friday, after a meeting between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office on Friday grew contentious.

Trump told Zelenskyy, "You're not acting at all thankful" for the support Zelenskyy's country had received from the United States, adding that the Ukrainian leader had been disrespectful and telling him, "You're gambling with World War III."

[!President Trump looks on during a joint press conference with U.K. <image:1569>](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5310647/trump-week-ukraine-russia)

### [Trump, Zelenskyy shouting match underscores change in U.S. foreign policy](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5310647/trump-week-ukraine-russia)

Zelenskyy tried to object, saying he has "all the respect for your country" and saying, "I said thanks," as Trump raised his voice to speak over him.

A scheduled news conference between the two men was subsequently canceled. Zelenskyy left the White House but didn't take questions.

Zelenskyy came to Washington and was expected to [sign a deal](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5312880/trump-zelenskyy-minerals-ukraine-russia)
 that would give the United States access to [Ukrainian rare earth and critical minerals](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/26/nx-s1-5309996/ukraine-rare-earth-minerals-metals-deal)
. But the heated session — with raised voices and cross talk playing out in front of TV cameras — left the future of the negotiations uncertain.

The argument came at the end of a lengthy question-and-answer session with reporters, after Trump defended his [approach with Russian President Vladimir Putin](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/18/nx-s1-5300669/us-russia-ukraine-saudi-arabia-summit)

    5:02 PM UTC President Donald Trump denounced Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy as a "dictator" on Wednesday and warned he had to move quickly to secure peace or risk losing his country, deepening a feud between the two leaders that has alarmed European officials.

The extraordinary attacks - a day after Trump claimed Ukraine was to blame for Russia's 2022 invasion - heightened concerns among U.S. and Russian officials that have sidelined Ukraine.

"A Dictator without Elections, Zelenskyy better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left," Trump wrote on social media, using an alternate spelling for the Ukrainian president's name.

In response, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said no one could force his country to give in.

"We will defend our right to exist," Sybiha said on X.

Later in the day while speaking to investors and executives in Miami, Trump doubled down on his comments, again calling Zelenskiy a "dictator" and suggesting the Ukrainian president wanted to prolong the war to "keep the gravy train going," a reference to U.S. security ally Australia, which has provided A$1.5 billion in support to Ukraine in its war with Russia, rejected Trump's assertions about Ukraine.

Less than a month into his presidency, Trump has [upended U.S. military aid.

Zelenskiy's five-year term was supposed to end in 2024, but elections cannot be held under martial law, which Ukraine imposed in February 2022 in response to Russia's invasion.

**ISTANBUL**

Reports that US President Donald Trump’s social media platform, Truth Social, is blocked across Ukraine are “false,” a Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesman said Thursday.

Social media users earlier claimed they were unable to access Truth Social, encountering a message that read, “Truth Social is currently unavailable in your region.”

However, Foreign Ministry spokesman Heorhii Tykhyi dismissed the claims on X.

“We have seen reports suggesting that access to the Truth Social network has been blocked in Ukraine. **Please contact us for subscription options.**](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/p/subscription/1001)

Tykhyi said Truth Social’s operations are currently limited to select countries, including the US, Canada, Brazil, Australia and a few others -- with Ukraine on that list.

“We would appreciate it if Truth Social would add Ukraine to their authorized region of operations,” he added.

Truth Social has yet to comment or address its limited regional availability.

It came one day after Trump labeled Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a “modestly successful comedian” and a “Dictator” on the platform.

The controversy follows heightened tensions between Washington and Kyiv after Trump’s remarks about Zelenskyy, which sparked backlash from Ukrainian officials.

! Ukraine did not and could not block access because, unfortunately, the social network Truth Social has never made itself available to users in Ukraine,” he said.

Tykhyi added that according to publicly available information, Truth Social is only available in a number of countries (the United States, Canada, Brazil, Australia, and a few others), and Ukraine is not on that list.

He stated that Ukraine would be grateful if Truth Social would add Ukraine to their authorized region of operations.

The Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council’s Center for Countering Disinformation posted on [Telegram](https://t.me/CenterCounteringDisinformation/13368)
 that Russian propaganda is spreading a fake story about the alleged ban of the Truth Social network in Ukraine by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

“The Russians are lying, claiming that Truth Social has been banned in Ukraine, which has never been available in our country. Therefore, the Russian propaganda’s claim that President Volodymyr Zelenskyy supposedly blocked the Truth Social network in Ukraine is a fake,” the center said.

Earlier, Russian propaganda spread a fake story about the alleged ban of Truth Social by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Ukraine.

Truth Social is a social media platform owned by Trump Media & Technology Group, where U.S. Photo: ukrinform.ua

Ukraine has not blocked access to the social media platform Truth Social and could not have done so, as this social network has never been available to Ukrainian users.

Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi announced this on [X](https://x.com/SpoxUkraineMFA/status/1892601891265134884)

President Donald Trump has traded barbs with Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy since the US-Russia talks in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on February 19, 2025 \[Nathan Howard/Reuters\]

As the third anniversary of [Russia’s Ukraine invasion](/news/2022/2/24/putin-orders-military-operations-in-eastern-ukraine-as-un-meets)
 nears, United States President Donald Trump has offered a false version of history.

 this week that included a discussion on how to end the war in Ukraine. Later, Trump dismissed complaints that Ukrainian officials were not invited to participate.

, answering reporters’ questions on February 18 at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Zelenskyy has promised elections once martial law is lifted.

We asked the White House for evidence that Ukraine had started the war and received no response.

Russia’s attempt to blame Ukraine is part of a longstanding argument that does not stand up to scrutiny.

What happened in February 2022
------------------------------

As people were sleeping, Russian troops and tanks rolled into Ukraine and missiles poured down in what US military analysts called the [largest military operation](/news/2025/1/8/russia-gained-4000sq-km-of-ukraine-in-2024-how-many-soldiers-did-it-lose)
 in Europe since World War II. [Russian President Vladimir Putin](/news/2025/2/19/putin-rates-us-talks-highly-says-russia-ready-to-negotiate-over-ukraine)
 announced it as a “special military operation” at 6am Moscow time (03:00 GMT) on February 24, 2022.

“The purpose of this operation is to protect people who, for eight years now, have been facing humiliation and genocide perpetrated by the Kyiv regime,” Putin said in a televised address. You should have ended it three years – you should have never started it, you could have made a deal.”

This clashes with the evidence that Russia sent a large invasion force into Ukraine in February 2022.

The notion that Kyiv “started it” – that it is to blame for an invasion that has killed an estimated 46,000 Ukrainian soldiers and at least 12,000 civilians – led to outrage in Ukraine and from its allies.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy responded that Trump “lives in this disinformation space”.

Trump’s deputy in his first term, Mike Pence, posted on February 19 on X, “Mr President, Ukraine did not ‘start’ this war. In Putin’s telling, “poor Russia was forced to rush to the persecuted Ukrainians’ defense and forestall NATO-inspired Ukrainian aggression”, Motyl said.

In 2023, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev echoed Putin’s stance, saying Ukraine is a part of Russia, but “we live in different apartments”.

Soon after the war started, more than 140 scholars signed a letter denouncing Putin’s narrative as “factually wrong, morally repugnant and deeply offensive to the memory of millions of victims of Nazism and those who courageously fought against it, including Russian and Ukrainian soldiers of the Red Army”.

As for Trump’s recent remark, it is a “distillation of these Russian talking points”, Herron said.

Our ruling
----------

Trump said Zelenskyy “started” the war in Ukraine with Russia.

On February 24, 2022, Russian forces launched an invasion of Ukraine, a country that the night before was at peace. “But today I heard \[from Ukraine\], ‘Oh well, we weren’t invited.’ Well, you’ve been there for three years. Ukrainian law bans parliamentary and presidential elections during a state of martial law, which currently exists. The attack followed weeks of Russian manoeuvres that included staging a large-scale military exercise along Russia’s border with Ukraine that the US estimated to include 190,000 Russian soldiers.

News coverage, video footage and the United Nations noted Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in real time."

This [front cover](https://archive.is/NEPa9)
 on X (formerly Twitter) with a photo of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, purportedly published by _The Economist,_ is ALTERED.

The post accompanying the magazine cover reads, “APOCALYPSE: Allowing missile strikes deep into Russia is the start of World War III,” warns the iconic prophetic magazine The Economist.”

However, did _The Economist_ publish the front cover? PesaCheck investigated.

_The Economist_ [website](https://www.economist.com/weeklyedition/archive)
 shows no November 2024 covers similar to the one under investigation.

In November, the outlet published two front pages featuring Donald Trump, but none had a photo of Russian President Putin or the headline “Apocalypse.”

The alleged front cover circulating online has stories similar to those in [an edition published](https://www.economist.com/weeklyedition/2024-03-16)
 by _The Economist._ However, it was altered to include photos of Trump and Putin.

The [original front cover](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1Di8B4QNPs/)
 has stories from _The Economist’s_ 16 March 2024 edition.

Additionally, the fake cover does not display a publication date, whereas authentic covers always indicate when the issue was released, as shown on the [website](https://www.economist.com/weeklyedition/archive)

PesaCheck has looked into this front cover on X with a photo of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin purportedly published by _The Economist_ and finds that it was ALTERED.

From [Source](https://www.aap.com.au/factcheck/fake-economist-apocalypse-cover-linked-to-pro-kremlin-propaganda/): 
Content: "The supposed magazine cover is a fake.

AAP FACTCHECK – A fake cover of The Economist magazine depicting Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin against an apocalyptic background has been shared on social media and pushed by a pro-Kremlin Telegram channel.

The faked image depicts US president-elect Trump and Russian President Putin in a face-to-face confrontation with missiles between them and the headline "APOCALYPSE".

The cover has turned up in [Facebook posts](https://mvau.lt/media/37ed0fb6-4352-4ad3-bc3a-25c86409fe78)
, in [X posts](https://mvau.lt/media/ac7986a3-4a4f-43f5-b479-8f1f205e5609)
 and on [Instagram](https://mvau.lt/media/fba74436-064c-4cad-8077-c56a8192eabc)
. 

The image bears The Economist's standard masthead and is accompanied by comments such as "...is Trump afraid to see how Biden's gang is starting a nuclear war?"

However, there are telltale signs the cover is fake. (Facebook/AAP)

*   "America pumbed-up economy" should read "America's pumped-up economy"
*   "Times up for TikTok" is missing the apostrophe in "Time's"
*   "industry" is missing an r in "A special report on oil industy"
*   "Biden left the White House" is untrue as Joe Biden is still the serving president.

Most of these cover lines appear, correctly spelled, on a genuine Economist cover from March 16, while the genuine February 24 cover featured Mr Putin and Mr Trump, in a different stance, with the headline "IS EUROPE READY?".

Fake Economist 'Apocalypse' cover linked to pro-Kremlin propaganda
==================================================================

David Williams November 28, 2024

!AAP FactCheck Feature Image Update 18 v3 <image:1580>

The supposed Economist magazine cover is fairly convincing, but it is a fake. Its leaders must urgently jettison their post-Soviet complacency and act before it is too late [https://t.co/qhmYsjLVTL](https://t.co/qhmYsjLVTL)
>  [pic.twitter.com/wPCoFUYk0A](https://t.co/wPCoFUYk0A)

> — The Economist (@TheEconomist) [February 22, 2024](https://twitter.com/TheEconomist/status/1760668341201461756?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

[The Economist's](https://www.economist.com/weeklyedition/archive)
 covers archive does not include the fake cover and it doesn't appear anywhere else on the popular magazine's website.

AAP FactCheck contacted The Economist but did not receive a response before publication.

The fake cover has been shared as tensions heighten between Russia and the West over the US decision to allow Ukraine to use American long-range missiles against Russia.

Russia's response, a hypersonic missile launched against Ukraine on [November 22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFBGwsXxSTQ)
, was reportedly a message to the West to ["back off"](https://www.reuters.com/world/putin-sends-missile-message-west-back-off-2024-11-22/)
 if they want to avoid a missile strike against US and British targets.

Social media posts sharing the fake Economist cover promote the message that Putin does not want nuclear war, and that reports of a bomb – or World War III – are emanating from "the Cabal" (the West).

The fake cover has echoes of a similar fake in [June 2024](https://www.reuters.com/fact-check/economist-did-not-publish-cover-warning-inevitable-nuclear-war-2024-06-14/)
, which depicted Mr Putin and President Joe Biden head to head over a chess game. 

[NewsGuard](https://www.newsguardrealitycheck.com/p/fake-economist-cover-used-by-russia?open=false#%C2%A7pro-kremlin-sources-cite-fake-economist-cover-story-to-fearmonger-world-war-iii)
 has linked the most recent cover to pro-Kremlin sources, who it says have been pushing the fake image to warn that US and NATO support of Ukraine, particularly the recent missile decision, have brought the world to the brink of nuclear war.

WHAT WAS CLAIMED

The Economist cover foreshadows apocalyptic conflict between the US and Russia.

OUR VERDICT

False. There is no publication date and spelling mistakes and errors appear in the cover lines (top right corner):

!Close-up of errors in fake Economist cover <image:1581> Several obvious errors in wording on the fake cover give away that it's a fake. (EPA PHOTO)

It cites Telegram channel @GolosMordora, which is affiliated with Russian intelligence services, as pushing the claim.

The fake cover was published [on Telegram](https://perma.cc/D4KR-L6XX)
 on November 18. 

Telegram translates the post into English as: "'Allowing missile strikes deep into Russia is the beginning of World War III,' warns the iconic prophetic magazine The Economist.

"Experts have long suspected that the authors are backed by the global elite – they have predicted all the epochal events since 1983 with frightening accuracy. This was the case with the COVID-19 epidemic, the NWO and the conflict in the Middle East.

"In the warning for December-January: what radical measures will Russia take in response, which countries will intervene in the conflict and who will be the first to use nuclear weapons – read the analysis if you are not afraid to find out the truth."

The post ends with a link to a fake Economist Telegram account.

The Verdict

False – The claim is inaccurate.

Russian propagandists push fake story that Zelenskyy bought Hitler's car

Russian propagandists push fake story that Zelenskyy bought Hitler's car

Print

washington — 

The article in the Seattle Tribune had everything: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Adolf Hitler and a $15 million classic car. Unsurprisingly, it spread like wildfire across Russia's state and pro-Kremlin media.

But the subject was a strange one for a news site about a U.S. city; such outlets usually cover only local stories.

In fact, the article with headline "Hitler's parade car bought by Ukraine's Zelensky" was another fake spread by Russian propaganda.

There is no such media outlet as the Seattle Tribune, just a website masquerading as a full-fledged publication. And the article itself was a compilation of Russia's disinformation "greatest hits" about Ukraine — "Nazism," "unrestrained corruption" and "wasting American aid."

According to the phony news article, Zelenskyy was spotted in Kyiv exiting a Mercedes-Benz 770K Grosser Offener Tourenwagen, Adolf Hitler's parade car. The sighting supposedly occurred just days after the Ukrainian leader returned from Washington, where the U.S. government had allocated an $8 billion aid package to his country.

The article featured a screenshot of a post by the Ukrainian Telegram messenger channel Realna Viyna ("Real War" in Ukrainian) featuring a photo of the vehicle parked in front of the Ukrainian presidential administration building in Kyiv.

![A screenshot of a fake Ukrainian Telegram messenger channel post includes a doctored photo of "Hitler's car" parked in front of the Ukrainian presidential administration.](https://gdb.voanews.com/e4bf172f-29ce-4381-8cfd-b641a37657e1_w250_r0_s.png)

A screenshot of a fake Ukrainian Telegram messenger channel post includes a doctored photo of "Hitler's car" parked in front of the Ukrainian presidential administration.

However, beyond the Seattle Tribune news site not actually existing, the article had several other glaring problems.

First, Realna Viyna did not publish the post in the screenshot. Second, the image of "Hitler's car" was stolen from a photo widely available on the internet that was digitally edited into an image of the Ukrainian presidential administration building.

!A post on Pinterest shows an image that was used to create a doctored photo of "Hitler's car" parked in front of the Ukrainian presidential administration. <image:164>

A post on Pinterest shows an image that was used to create a doctored photo of "Hitler's car" parked in front of the Ukrainian presidential administration.

VOA found that the angle of photo in the screenshot, a black spot on the asphalt under the car's running board, and the reflection on the front windshield completely match the image of the Mercedes-Benz 770K found across the internet.

Third, the Seattle Tribune website was registered on October 3, 2024, just six days before the fake article was published. And the registration was set for only one year.

The Seattle Tribune appears to belong to a network of disinformation websites controlled by John Mark Dougan, an American living in Russia, according to Shayan Sardarizadeh, a journalist who fact checks and debunks disinformation at the BBC.

He noted on social network X that creating fake local American news sites is Dougan's standard approach. That conclusion matches VOA's observations about Dougan's network.

A former deputy sheriff in Florida, Dougan was charged with extortion and wiretapping in the United States. In 2016, he fled to Russia and later received political asylum there.

He now operates at least 167 disinformation sites that often publish narratives serving Russian interests, according to a May 2024 investigation by [NewsGuard.](https://www.newsguardtech.com/press/special-report-newsguard-and-new-book-expose-global-disinformation-reach-of-moscow-based-former-florida-sheriffs-deputy/)

[Dougan's sites](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c72ver6172do)
 previously attracted widespread attention for spreading a fake story claiming that Ukraine's first lady, Olena Zelenska, had purchased a $4.8 million Bugatti supercar during a visit to France for commemorations of the D-Day landing.

That story seemed to be aimed at a Western audience. The fake "Hitler car" story, however, is mostly spreading in the Russian information space. In a message on the Telegram messenger, Dougan told VOA that he was unaware of the Seattle Tribune_._

"Never heard of it. But I looked it up \[and\] heard there's lots of great information on there. A real pillar of journalistic integrity, on par with the NYT, CNN and MSNBC," he wrote, referring to _The New York Times_ and two major U.S. TV news channels.

As is often the case with higher-quality fakes, the phony story about Hitler's parade car combines a fictitious narrative about Zelenskyy with real facts about the sale of a former Nazi parade car in the United States.

The factual information comes from an article in a real American newspaper: _The Seattle Times,_ which reported in February 2018 that [the Mercedes-Benz 770K had briefly appeared in the Seattle area](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/how-hitlers-car-ended-up-parked-in-medina/)
 after having been put up for auction in Scottsdale, Arizona, a month earlier.

While the vehicle did not sell at the auction, it soon found a buyer. After that, the "Hitler car" was briefly unloaded from a truck in the wealthy Seattle suburb of Medina, where it attracted the attention of a local resident, who told _The Seattle Times_ about it. Later, the car was likely reloaded onto the truck and taken way.

The director of the auction company Worldwide Auctioneers, Rod Egan (his name was also mentioned in the fake Seattle Tribune story), refused to tell _The Seattle Time_s the buyer of the car, citing a non-disclosure agreement.

However, Egan said the car's ultimate destination was "very, very far away" outside the United States.

_The Seattle Times_ article also cited a German media report that six such cars were bought by a Russian billionaire in 2009. Among them was the vehicle mentioned in the fake article.

The fake story about Zelenskyy and the "Hitler car" also recalled a scene from the 2001 American comedy film "Rat Race," in which actor Jon Lovitz steals Hitler's parade car from a fictional museum of Nazi SS officer Klaus Barbie and then crashes it into a gathering of American World War II veterans.

Asked whether he was familiar with the film and scene, Dougan replied, "Comedy gold right there."

Russian media spread hoax about Zelensky buying Hitler’s car for $15 million
============================================================================

11 October 2024

[](/en/authors/the-insider)

[##### The Insider](/en/authors/the-insider)

[**_RU_**](https://theins.press/antifake/275180)

A series of fake publications about President Volodymyr Zelensky's alleged multi-million dollar purchases — including a hotel with a casino in Northern Cyprus, a winery in Tuscany that belonged to a famous British musician, and a brand new Bugatti for Ukraine’s First Lady — has been updated with an unbelievable new addition: the story that Zelensky has ostensibly purchased Adolf Hitler's parade car and drives it around Kyiv. The Russian tabloid _Moskovsky Komsomolets_ ”[reports](https://www.mk.ru/politics/2024/10/08/zelenskiy-kupil-mersedes-gitlera-za-astronomicheskuyu-summu.html)
”:

> “Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky has purchased a car that belonged to Adolf Hitler. The Nazi Fuhrer rode in this Mercedes at the parade in Berlin after the surrender of France in 1940. The purchase was reported by _Seattle Tribune_.

> “As the publication writes, the car was noticed in the center of Kyiv in early October. It had brought Zelensky to the administration building on Bankova Street. This happened shortly after Zelensky returned from his American tour.

> “The article says that the amount Zelensky paid for the Mercedes-Benz 770k is unknown, but experts estimate its value as approximately $15 million. The Nazi dictator's car was confiscated by the U.S. Army after the war ended.”

_Argumenty i Fakty_ throws in some [details](https://aif.ru/politics/world/seattle-tribune-zelenskiy-kupil-paradnyy-limuzin-gitlera)
:

> “The United States attempted to auction the car in 2018. The endeavor failed because the $7 million bid fell short of the expected value. Subsequently, representatives stated they were negotiating the sale of the car with a client outside the U.S.”

![](/images/PJA9qLuVPnDCVQFT36GVoRhJDpYG41YEEmwqC8KGZzk/rs:fill:433:562:0:0/dpr:2/q:80/bG9jYWw6L3B1Ymxp/Yy9zdG9yYWdlL2Nv/bnRlbnRfYmxvY2sv/aW1hZ2UvMjg5NzYv/ZmlsZS00NzdjMDlh/MGQ3NGVlMjEyNTRl/NmU4NDI0ZjU5Mjdl/Zi5qcGc.jpg)

The failed 2018 auction story is true — except that the negotiations did in fact end in February 2022, with the car being [purchased](https://www.thetimes.com/world/article/australian-politician-clive-palmer-buys-hitlers-mercedes-from-russian-tycoon-hlzpn20vf)
 by Australian national Clive Palmer for his future car museum. According to _The Times_, its previous owner was a Russian tycoon who had bought the car for more than $7 million. However, after Palmer was suspected in Australia of violating the anti-Russian sanctions regime and glorifying Nazism, he [denied](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-03-02/clive-palmer-reportedly-buys-hitlers-car/100874720)
 the purchase.

_Seattle Tribune_, which first wrote about Zelensky's purchase of the car, is one of many fake publications created to plant dirt against Putin’s enemies. Olena Zelenska's fictional purchase of a Bugatti was reported by the non-existent French publication _Vérité Cachée_ in July 2024 using a similar method. The website of _Seattle Tribune_ was registered just a few days ago, and the Internet Archive [shows](https://web.archive.org/web/20241003162854/https:/seattle-tribune.com/)
 that on Oct. 3, 2024, it was completely empty.

![](/images/n_infmIDLGIc64dpaqUUZFl0ar-9-4ysK9mh30_K6v0/rs:fit:866:0:0:0/dpr:2/q:80/bG9jYWw6L3B1Ymxp/Yy9zdG9yYWdlL2Nv/bnRlbnRfYmxvY2sv/aW1hZ2UvMjg5Nzcv/ZmlsZS0yNzVhNzRh/MTg4MzVlYWZlZmZl/MDRmMDk2MDdlNGM0/YS5qcGc.jpg)

The pseudo-American publication [presents](https://seattle-tribune.com/hitlers-parade-car-bought-by-ukraines-zelensky/)
 a screenshot ostensibly captured from the Ukrainian Telegram channel “Real War | Ukraine | News” with a photo of a car outside the Ukrainian president's office building.

![](/images/BKCFlFjgqajb2a869v73hlrvaWyQRlD2DYAySfdwh9A/rs:fit:866:0:0:0/dpr:2/q:80/bG9jYWw6L3B1Ymxp/Yy9zdG9yYWdlL2Nv/bnRlbnRfYmxvY2sv/aW1hZ2UvMjg5Nzgv/ZmlsZS01ZTgzNWU0/OTliZGNhMzc5NjQz/MjQ3YzIzNGNmYzcx/OC5qcGc.jpg)

Of course, the channel published no such post, and the image itself was doctored. The car was cut from a photo that [illustrated](https://ru.axar.az/news/vmire/235827.html)
 the auction announcements on various websites in 2017.

![](/images/jImvSXip56iyK9-6Y6tFeFIZ5IH0sg4LmaY1Wiy8Xwg/rs:fit:866:0:0:0/dpr:2/q:80/bG9jYWw6L3B1Ymxp/Yy9zdG9yYWdlL2Nv/bnRlbnRfYmxvY2sv/aW1hZ2UvMjg5Nzkv/ZmlsZS02NDA5ZWM2/OTM2YmJhYzJjZTc4/ZDdjMjExN2E2M2Q3/Yy5qcGc.jpg)

As we can see, tree reflections in the fenders of the car in the two images match — and there are no trees this big anywhere near the building on Bankova Street. The authors of the hoax only tried to blur the reflection of the American police car in the door, and they weren't too thorough about it, leaving visible traces of the partially erased reflection. The license plates are blurred too — an understandable move for the original 2017 photo, when the car belonged to a private owner — but why would one care to hide the license plates of a presidential car that Zelensky purportedly uses to get to his office and drive around Kyiv?

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is once again the target of disinformation for allegedly spending money intended for the Ukrainian Army. This time, it is claimed he bought the famous Mercedes-Benz 770, whose most famous owner was Hitler. The claims come from the “news portal” Seattle Tribune, created a few days before the breaking news, while the main source is a manipulated screenshot from Telegram. Not only such a photo does not exist on the Telegram group that is quoted, the illustration is also a montage of two different pictures. This new attack on Zelensky comes only a few days after his visit to the United States, where he presented his “Victory Plan”

Disinformation attacks on Ukrainian President **Volodymyr** **Zelensky** have been a constant since the war in Ukraine started. This time, it is claimed he allegedly bought the “Mercedes-Benz 770” car or the “Großer Mercedes” (the “Grand Mercedes”) of the infamous dictator of Nazi Germany, **Adolf Hitler,** for 15 million dollars**.** It is true the “Mercedes-Benz 770” was one of the most famous and most used models in the ranks of the Nazi Party in Germany and that it was this car which Hitler used for the [victory parade in France](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/16/hitlers-wartime-mercedes-car-to-be-sold-in-scottsdale-arizona.html#:~:text=Hitler%20used%20it%20for%20a%20victory%20parade%20after%20the%20Nazis%E2%80%99%20swift%20defeat%20of%20France)
. However, as early as 2018, the car was auctioned in [Arizona, USA](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/16/hitlers-wartime-mercedes-car-to-be-sold-in-scottsdale-arizona.html)
. This disinformation was also fact-checked by numerous colleagues from Lithuania ([15min](https://www.15min.lt/naujiena/aktualu/pasaulis/ar-tiesa-kad-v-zelenskis-isigijo-a-hitlerio-automobili-57-2323218)

 and [Center for Countering Disinformation](https://cpd.gov.ua/en/international-threats-en/fake-about-zelenskyys-purchase-of-hitlers-parade-car/)

, [Australia](https://www.aap.com.au/factcheck/russian-disinformation-campaign-accuses-zelensky-of-spending-millions-on-cars/)
, as well as the diplomatic service of the EU, [EUvsDisinfo](https://euvsdisinfo.eu/report/zelenskyy-buys-hitlers-mercedes/)

“The news” has started to spread relatively quickly in the Baltic states and Ukraine, with a picture or [video](https://www.facebook.com/psimeonoff/videos/570591355306096)
 being shared, as well as a direct link from the website [Seattle Tribune](https://seattle-tribune.com/hitlers-parade-car-bought-by-ukraines-zelensky/)
, which at first sight resembles a real news portal.

**Photo: Screenshot from [Seattle Tribune](https://seattle-tribune.com/hitlers-parade-car-bought-by-ukraines-zelensky/)
**

However, numerous problematic moments surrounding the portal can be recognized immediately. Firstly, according to the [US Library of Congress](https://www.loc.gov/item/sn87093403/)
, the weekly newspaper “Seattle Tribune” was founded in 1931 and it is not known exactly when in the last century it was shut down. Consequently, no data can be found on whether the portal with the same name, created later on, has anything to do with the original.

Secondly, since the site is first registered [on the 3rd of October, 2024](https://who.is/whois/seattle-tribune.com)
, a few days before the breaking news about Zelensky was published, it is very suspicious. There is no Impressum on the website, nor are there links to the journalists who write the news, the date the news was published or any other information about the portal itself. This is clear indication that this site impersonates a real news portal through which vectors of disinformation attacks are created, which is [a well-known tactic.](https://vistinomer.mk/proveruvachi-na-fakti-go-iscrtaa-patot-na-ruskite-dezinformacii-za-zelenski-i-najbliskite/)

It is also suspicious how the main source of this news is actually a screenshot from a channel on the Telegram platform, called [“Реальна Війна”](https://t.me/s/voynareal)
 or Real War (there is no link to the Telegram post).

**Photo: manipulated picture from Seattle Tribune, allegedly sourced from the Telegram group “Real War”** 

The picture itself, portraying the “Mercedes”, allegedly parked in front of the Presidential Palace of Ukraine, is obvious to be altered with at least two pictures.

One of the pictures, from the Presidential Palace in Kyiv, can be found on [Adobe Stock](https://stock.adobe.com/images/kiev-ukraine-august-04-2021-office-building-of-the-president-of-ukraine-city-of-kyiv/482821474?prev_url=detail)
 — a site for downloading photos for commercial use. The other, can be found on the [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/859132066386149502/)
 platform. The photo manipulation is done so that the photo of the car is superimposed over the other photo of the palace. The same reflections can be seen from the fenders of the “Mercedes” and the hood. Moreover, the picture shows the weather was sunny, or at least clear. Meanwhile, on the 6th of October, when this disinformation actually began to be spread, the weather forecast for Kyiv indicated [record rainfall.](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-regions/3913586-u-kievi-6-zovtna-zafiksuvali-rekordnu-kilkist-opadiv.html)

#### **Inspiration behind the disinformation**  

As in all previous cases when Zelensky and his family members were the [target of disinformation](https://vistinomer.mk/proveruvachi-na-fakti-go-iscrtaa-patot-na-ruskite-dezinformacii-za-zelenski-i-najbliskite/)
, it was usually preceded by an important event that will wake up the Russian propagandists in order to distract attention elsewhere. More specifically, to undermine the trust not only of the citizens of Ukraine, but also of politicians and allies from the USA and the West who supply them with financial and military aid. And with that, prolong or block the help they are receiving, as was the case during the winter with the [US Congress.](https://vistinomer.mk/ruski-razorni-dezinformacii-ja-potpaluvaat-amerikanskata-politichka-scena/)

This time, the possible reason might be that one week before the website Seattle Tribune was created, Zelensky was in the United States. More specifically, on the 23rd of September he was in the state of [Pennsylvania](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/23/europe/ukraine-zelensky-pennsylvania-us-visit-intl-hnk/index.html)
, where he visited an ammunition factory, while a few days later, on the 26th of September, he presented his [“Victory Plan”](https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20240926-ukraine-will-prevail-joe-biden-tells-volodymyr-zelensky-after-pledging-8-billion-in-military-aid-to-kyiv)
 in the Oval Office in the White House.

On another note, six times just this year, Truthmeter.mk has fact-checked different disinformation surrounding the alleged luxuries of Zelensky, according to which, it turns out he has allegedly spent over one billion dollars intended as aid for the Ukrainian Army.

The more recent allegations about Zelensky purchasing Hitler's car were supported by more "evidence," including a story from the "Seattle Tribune" that reported the car was spotted in Kyiv just days after the Ukrainian leader was in the United States to meet with President Joe Biden.

**A Fake Story And A Fake News Site**

To further bolster the disinformation campaign, the Seattle Times was filled with other news articles, although those appear to rely heavily on AI-generated content culled from other local news sites.

[BBC Verify's Shayan Sardarizadeh reported](https://x.com/Shayan86/status/1843706641000345981 "https://x.com/Shayan86/status/1843706641000345981")
 that not only is there no such news outlet based in Seattle, but that the website was only set up in the past week "specifically to post this fake story."

The effort was almost certainly implemented to raise questions regarding any future support for Zelensky, but also to bolster the Kremlin's claim that its "special military operation" was directed at "de-Nazifying" Ukraine.

**Mixing Truth Into The Fiction**
---------------------------------

What makes this story about Hitler's automobile ending up in Ukraine seem all the more believable is that the fake news site included key facts about the car's history.

The Nazi dictator's Mercedes-Benz 770 Grosser Offener Tourenwagen was indeed used in the victory parade after Germany defeated France, and it was previously listed by Worldwide Auctioneers in 2018 as the faux news piece reported. [](https://www.forbes.com/)

Misinformation and disinformation campaigns on social media could be increasingly difficult to identify, as new tools and efforts attempt to make the stories seem legitimate. It was reportedly the same car that the German despot rode in during his victory parade after the defeat of France in June 1940. Photos of the car in that news article and on social media appeared to be from the auction house.

This story evokes memories of the infamous "Hitler diaries," which turned out to be forgeries.

**Hitler's Ride Is Now In A Private Collection**
------------------------------------------------

Despite the efforts that were taken, the disinformation campaign was still easy enough to debunk with a few searches. They are rarely driven, period."

Sending a car this expensive a long distance would certainly bring on its own set of challenges.

"It would have to be closely guarded, lots of security, and would probably wind up on a private cargo plane somehow, with a security escort," Earnest continued.

**Details, Details, Details**
-----------------------------

The reporting from the "Seattle Tribune" didn't go into when Zelensky bought the car, but enough truths were mixed in that the story sounded credible.

Those with commonsense might question why Zelensky would spend millions of dollars on the car and bring it to Kyiv, which regularly comes under attack from Russian drones and missiles—but disinformation typically relies on people believing the claim without doing further research or asking such questions.

"The Hitler's car story is an obvious piece of propaganda by those seeking to undermine Ukraine," explained social media analyst Greg Sterling, co-founder of Near Media. A recent fake news story has been making the rounds this week, citing a report from a seemingly mainstream news outlet.

The story in question suggested that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky recently spent $15 million to buy a Mercedes 770 automobile that was previously owned by Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler. In the past, however, the supporting evidence of the dubious claims was little more than photos and anonymous sources.

In July, a post went so far as to show a "sales receipt" for a Bugatti sportscar purportedly bought by Olena Zelenska, wife of President Zelensky. Notably, AutoEvolution.com reported in 2022 that the car is now in the car collection of Australian billionaire Clive Palmer.

"The auction prompted a $7 million bid but the reserve was not met. No word on how much Palmer ended up paying for it, but he did put in two years' worth of negotiations," [the auto website stated](https://www.autoevolution.com/news/hitlers-armored-mercedes-770k-limo-is-now-part-of-billionaires-private-collection-182835.html "https://www.autoevolution.com/news/hitlers-armored-mercedes-770k-limo-is-now-part-of-billionaires-private-collection-182835.html")
. There is no indication that Palmer has sold it.

An attempt to reach out to Palmer was not answered.

However, it would be unclear that Palmer could have sold such a vehicle without it gaining considerable attention.

"It's certainly not unheard of for very high-profile and über-valuable cars to change hands privately, but it typically isn't the norm," explained Brian Earnest, editorial director of _Old Cars Magazine._ "If a seller is looking for the best price, they will usually have their best luck publicizing the sale well ahead of time and turning it over to one of the big auction houses, who attract the wealthy buyers, know who the 'whales' are, and have experience handling and selling 'star' cars and investment grade vehicles."

Earnest said there are "plenty" of high-end exotic cars that have changed hands privately over the years, but it would be doubtful Zelensky could rent a car without it gaining much media attention.

"The car in question didn't sell for a reported bid of $7 million fairly recently, but it's not out of the question it could sell for $15 million," added Earnest."

사진 한 장이 2022년 러시아의 우크라이나 침공 이후 우크라이나에게 격추당한 러시아 전투기를 촬영한 것이라는 주장과 함께 소셜미디어상에서 반복적으로 공유됐다. 하지만 이 사진은 1993년 영국에서 에어쇼 도중 발생한 사고 현장을 촬영한 것으로, 2022년 러시아의 우크라이나 침공과는 무관하다.

문제의 사진은 2022년 2월 24일 "우크라이나 방공부대에 격추당하는 러시아 전투기"라는 글귀와 함께 [페이스북](https://archive.ph/sJbrs)
에 공유됐다.

문제의 주장이 공유된 페이스북 게시글 스크린샷. 2022년 3월 10일 캡쳐. ( AFP)

해당 사진은 우크라이나 정부군이 2022년 2월 24일 러시아 전투기 5대와 헬기 한 대를 친러시아 반군이 장악한 우크라이나 동부 지역에서 격추했다고 [발표](https://www.deccanherald.com/international/ukraine-claims-downed-five-russian-planes-helicopter-1084634.html)
한 이후부터 온라인상에 공유됐다.

동일한 사진이 유사한 주장과 함께 트위터 [여기](https://archive.ph/i2vgR)
와 [여기](https://archive.ph/7gu4S)
에도 공유됐고, 우크라이나 정부군이 발표한 내용을 보도한 한 국내 온라인 매체의 기사에도 [게시](https://archive.ph/JIuGU)
됐다.

하지만 이 사진은 1993년 영국의 한 에어쇼 도중 촬영된 것으로, 2022년 러시아의 우크라이나 침공과는 무관하다.

### 에어쇼 사고

러시아 포털사이트 얀덱스 역 이미지 검색을 통해 페이스북에 잘못된 주장과 함께 공유된 사진과 일치하는 사진을 항공 사진 데이터베이스 [Air Team Images](https://archive.md/Net24)
에서 찾을 수 있었다.

두 사진 비교를 통해 페이스북에 공유된 사진이 좌우 반전된 것을 알 수 있다.

이 웹사이트는 칼 포드(Carl Ford)라는 인물이 1993년 7월 24일 영국의 페어포드시(Fairford)에서 해당 사진을 촬영했다고 소개하고 있다.

사진에는 "러시아 미그-29 전투기 2대가 충돌한 사고 장면을 촬영한 사진. 사고로 인한 사망자나 심한 부상자는 발생하지 않았다"라는 설명이 붙었다.

다음은 페이스북에 공유된 사진(좌)과 Air Team Images에 게시된 원본 사진(우)을 비교한 것이다.

페이스북에 게시된 사진(좌)과 Air Team Images에 게시된 원본 사진(우) 비교 ( AFP)

해당 사진을 촬영한 포드는 동일한 사진을 2015년 10월 15일 온라인 사진 공유 및 관리 웹사이트 [플리커](https://www.flickr.com/photos/53277566@N06/5520340518/in/photostream/)
에도 게시했는데, 이 사진에도 유사한 설명이 붙었다.

포드는 AFP와 서면 인터뷰에서 "이 사진은 내가 1993년 7월 24일 촬영한 11장의 사진 중 하나다. 촬영에는 니콘 F.3 HP 카메라를 이용했다."라고 말했다.

영국 일간지 인디펜던트(The Independent)는 1993년 7월 26일 자 [기사](https://archive.md/uJxrQ)
를 통해 포드가 촬영한 사진에 등장하는 사고를 보도했는데 이 기사에는 "영국 공군이 이번 주말 열린 세계 최대 규모의 에어쇼에서 발생한 러시아 전투기 공중 충돌 사고의 원인 규명을 위한 조사에 착수했다"라는 내용이 담겨있다.

해당 사고는 1993년 영국 의회가 발표한 [보고서](https://archive.md/U6NNx)
에서도 언급됐다.

Keyword searches found a similar claim has circulated since 2023, which has been [debunked](https://mythdetector.ge/en/ukrainian-lands-and-banned-the-burial-of-military-personnel/)
 by other fact-checking organizations, including Myth Detector based in Georgia.

Dafina Kandova, a journalist with the Bulgarian checking organization factcheck.bg, told AFCL that her organization had [checked](https://factcheck.bg/ne-e-vyarno-che-amerikanskata-kompaniya-blackrock-zabranyava-na-ukrajna-da-pogrebva-ubitite-si-vojnici-si-v-grobishta/)

 similar rumors circulating in Bulgaria at the end of 2023.

Dafina added that while Plamen Paskov often appears as a commentator for the Bulgarian nationalist Ataka party, he is not actually an official member of the party and has not been elected to public office.

Paskov’s popularity is largely built on social media, gaining followers by spreading conspiracy theories related to hot topics such as COVID-19 and the war in Ukraine, she added. 6, 2024.

“BlackRock purchased 47% of Ukraine’s arable lands … BlackRock has asked the Ukrainian government to stop burying deceased Ukrainian soldiers and look for other ways to take care of them because it wants to use the lands in a different way,” reads the claim in part.

Zhao cited a Bulgarian politician named Plamen Paskov whose claim about BlackRock's land ownership in Ukraine was previously [shared](https://big5.sputniknews.cn/20240802/1060759436.html)
 by Russia's state-run Sputnik news agency.

The same claim was shared on other Chinese websites as seen [here](https://user.guancha.cn/main/content?id=1280544)

‘In an article published in early August, Russian and Chinese media quoted a purported Bulgarian politician as saying that U.S. The New York-based multinational asset manager has a big enough stake in many influential companies worldwide to push them to change decisions and priorities.

According to a Ukrainian government [press release](https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/prezident-obgovoriv-z-generalnim-direktorom-blackrock-koordi-80105)
, President Volodymyr Zelensky met BlackRock CEO Larry Fink to discuss how Ukraine could raise national reconstruction funds at the end of 2022.

In May 2023, the Ukrainian government [signed](https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/prezident-proviv-zustrich-iz-kerivnictvom-najbilshoyi-u-svit-82725)
 an agreement with BlackRock to provide support services to the Ukraine Development Fund in order to attract funds to rebuild the economy after the war ends.

But the claim about BlackRock’s land ownership in Ukraine and its request to the government regarding deceased soldiers is false.

Under Ukrainian law, foreign companies and individuals are [prohibited](https://www.fao.org/faolex/results/details/en/c/LEX-FAOC043459/)
 from purchasing arable land.

“Agricultural land cannot be transferred (allotted) to foreigners, stateless persons, foreign legal entities and foreign states,” reads the Article 22 of Ukraine’s Land Code (No. BlackRock does not own any land in Ukraine.”

Disinformation, as if the head of BlackRock bought Ukrainian lands and banned the burial of military personnel

On June 23-24, Russian-language Facebook accounts ([1](https://www.facebook.com/olga.petkevich.1/posts/pfbid0zFb8scpYzp1pemiXc82TUkYLAcd6MCyL35uNww8jr6aRcY5vT25dNUPtRSsfLR1Dl)
,[2](https://www.facebook.com/anastasiya.nogovicyna/posts/pfbid02dJ5anhinp72uF6vdapbShugY5SiL4EYhXDakgN9YRjCwK21HDVj6cWmWsJhLfpnJl)
) reported that 17 million hectares of Ukrainian agricultural land were already transferred to international corporations within the framework of the “Ukraine Development Fund” created in 2023. The posts state that the creator of this fund, Larry Fink, who is the head of the American corporation BlackRock, banned the burial of dead Ukrainian soldiers on this land, because “unsustainable waste of valuable arable land” is inappropriate.

Identical posts were published by Russian-language users ([1](https://www.facebook.com/100050002686731/videos/2243608662643791)
,[2](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid02436rJyqZ29mLzwfwB6749KG1EHHknwMEJT6WMSA7RBLxSBq7fShqoN7viQzb4YWUl&id=100006870016043)
) on May 12. Ukrainian legislation prohibits foreign companies from purchasing agricultural land.**

Russian director, actor, and propagandist Nikita Mikhalkov also voiced the claim that Larry Fink, the co-founder and CEO of the American company BlackRock, forbade the burial of Ukrainian soldiers killed in the Russian-Ukrainian war on Ukrainian soil. The claim that Ukraine was sold to the mentioned company is a Russian propaganda narrative, which is also [voiced](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/kyiv-has-sold-ukraine-to-blackrock-russia-lambasts-ukraine-for-taking-support-from-us/videoshow/106731755.cms?from=mdr)
 by Russian high-ranking officials.

It is also false to claim that international corporations have bought 17 million hectares of Ukrainian land. For more details, see:

Russian-language Facebook accounts Olga Petkevich, Anastasiya Nogovicyna, Архангел Михаил and Robindranat Tagor regularly disseminate disinformation of anti-Western and anti-Ukrainian content.

**The claim that the head of BlackRock banned the burial of Ukrainian soldiers on Ukrainian soil is false and originates from a satirical Telegram channel. The information was [published](https://t.me/verysexydasha/13745)

### War and Theft: The Takeover of Ukraine’s Agricultural Land exposes the financial interests and the dynamics at play leading to further concentration of land and finance.

The total amount of land controlled by oligarchs, corrupt individuals, and large agribusinesses is over nine million hectares — exceeding 28 percent of Ukraine’s arable land. <image:2886>](https://www.oaklandinstitute.org/war-theft-takeover-ukraine-agricultural-land)
Western financing to Ukraine in recent years has been tied to a drastic structural adjustment program that has required austerity and privatization measures, including the creation of a land market for the sale of agricultural land. With the land market in place, amidst high economic stress and war, this difference of treatment will lead to more land consolidation by large agribusinesses.

The report also sounds the alarm that Ukraine’s crippling debt is being used as a leverage by the financial institutions to drive post-war reconstruction towards further privatization and liberalization reforms in several sectors, including agriculture.

War And Theft: The Takeover of Ukraine’s Agricultural Land
==========================================================

by Frédéric Mousseau and Eve Devillers. <image:2887>](https://www.oaklandinstitute.org/war-theft-takeover-ukraine-agricultural-land)
This report addresses this gap – identifying the interests controlling Ukraine’s agricultural land and presenting an analysis of the dynamics at play around land tenure in the country. This includes the highly controversial land reform that took place in 2021 as part of the structural adjustment program initiated under the auspices of Western financial institutions, after the installation of a pro-European Union (EU) government following the Maidan Revolution in 2014.

With 33 million hectares of arable land, Ukraine has large swaths of the most fertile farmland in the world. <image:2888>](https://www.oaklandinstitute.org/war-theft-takeover-ukraine-agricultural-land)
In addition, according to the government, about five million hectares – the size of two Crimea – have been “stolen” by private interests from the state of Ukraine."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Asia Fact Check Lab ([https://www.rfa.org/english/news/afcl/afcl-blackrock-ukraine-land-08262024030948.html](https://www.rfa.org/english/news/afcl/afcl-blackrock-ukraine-land-08262024030948.html)) debunks the claim that BlackRock asked Ukraine not to bury soldiers on its land, stating the claim originated from a Bulgarian politician and was shared by Russian and Chinese media. The article also mentions that BlackRock does not own any land in Ukraine (<image:2869>). Myth Detector ([https://mythdetector.com/en/ukrainian-lands-and-banned-the-burial-of-military-personnel/](https://mythdetector.com/en/ukrainian-lands-and-banned-the-burial-of-military-personnel/)) also fact-checks the claim, stating it is false and originated from a satirical Telegram channel (<image:2875>).

The Oakland Institute's report ([https://tlio.org.uk/war-and-theft-the-hostile-takeover-of-ukraines-agricultural-land-private-equitys-21st-century-war-for-global-enclosure-and-slavery/](https://tlio.org.uk/war-and-theft-the-hostile-takeover-of-ukraines-agricultural-land-private-equitys-21st-century-war-for-global-enclosure-and-slavery/)) discusses land ownership in Ukraine and the role of Western financial institutions, identifying the interests controlling Ukraine’s agricultural land (<image:2885>, <image:2886>, <image:2887>, <image:2888>).


### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/E-10-2024-002526_EN.html): 
Content: The European Parliament discusses the purchase of Ukrainian farmland by multinational companies, including BlackRock. The document, dated November 13, 2024, questions the impact of this on EU food supply dependence and suggests the US is seeking to control Ukrainian farmland.


## Elaboration
The claim is false. Multiple sources, including the Asia Fact Check Lab ([https://www.rfa.org/english/news/afcl/afcl-blackrock-ukraine-land-08262024030948.html](https://www.rfa.org/english/news/afcl/afcl-blackrock-ukraine-land-08262024030948.html)) and Myth Detector ([https://mythdetector.com/en/ukrainian-lands-and-banned-the-burial-of-military-personnel/](https://mythdetector.com/en/ukrainian-lands-and-banned-the-burial-of-military-personnel/)), debunk the claim, citing its origin from a Bulgarian politician and a satirical Telegram channel, respectively. Furthermore, BlackRock does not own land in Ukraine.

The Oakland Institute's report ([https://tlio.org.uk/war-and-theft-the-hostile-takeover-of-ukraines-agricultural-land-private-equitys-21st-century-war-for-global-enclosure-and-slavery/](https://tlio.org.uk/war-and-theft-the-hostile-takeover-of-ukraines-agricultural-land-private-equitys-21st-century-war-for-global-enclosure-and-slavery/)) discusses land ownership in Ukraine, but it does not mention BlackRock's land ownership.

A European Parliament document ([https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/E-10-2024-002526_EN.html](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/E-10-2024-002526_EN.html)) mentions BlackRock's involvement in purchasing Ukrainian farmland, but it does not support the claim.


## Final Judgement
The claim is demonstrably false. Multiple fact-checking sources confirm the claim's falsehood and indicate its origin from unreliable sources. Additionally, BlackRock does not own land in Ukraine. `false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim that BlackRock requested Ukrainian soldiers not be buried on its land is false.

An **airliner** is a type of [airplane](/wiki/Airplane "Airplane")
 for transporting [passengers](/wiki/Passenger "Passenger")
 and [air cargo](/wiki/Air_cargo "Air cargo")
. Such aircraft are most often operated by [airlines](/wiki/Airline "Airline")
. The modern and most common variant of the airliner is a long, tube shaped, and [jet powered aircraft](/wiki/Jetliner "Jetliner")
. The largest of them are [wide-body](/wiki/Wide-body_aircraft "Wide-body aircraft")
 jets which are also called twin-aisle because they generally have two separate aisles running from the front to the back of the passenger cabin. These are usually used for [long-haul flights](/wiki/Flight_length#Short-haul_and_long-haul "Flight length")
 between [airline hubs](/wiki/Airline_hub "Airline hub")
 and major cities. A smaller, more common class of airliners is the [narrow-body](/wiki/Narrow-body_aircraft "Narrow-body aircraft")
 or single-aisle. These are generally used for short to medium-distance flights with fewer passengers than their wide-body counterparts.

[Regional airliners](/wiki/Regional_airliner "Regional airliner")
 typically seat fewer than 100 passengers and may be powered by [turbofans](/wiki/Turbofan "Turbofan")
 or [turboprops](/wiki/Turboprop "Turboprop")
. These airliners are the non-[mainline](/wiki/Mainline_(flight) "Mainline (flight)")
 counterparts to the larger aircraft operated by the major carriers, [legacy carriers](/wiki/Legacy_carrier "Legacy carrier")
, and [flag carriers](/wiki/Flag_carrier "Flag carrier")
, and are used to feed traffic into the large airline hubs. These regional routes then form the spokes of a hub-and-spoke air transport model.

The lightest aircraft are short-haul regional feeder airliner type aircraft that carry a small number of passengers are called commuter aircraft, commuterliners, feederliners, and [air taxis](/wiki/Air_taxi "Air taxi")
, depending on their size, engines, how they are marketed, region of the world, and seating configurations. The [Beechcraft 1900](/wiki/Beechcraft_1900 "Beechcraft 1900")
, for example, has only 19 seats.

When the [Wright brothers](/wiki/Wright_brothers "Wright brothers")
 made the world's first sustained [heavier-than-air flight](/wiki/Heavier-than-air_flight "Heavier-than-air flight")
, they laid the foundation for what would become a major transport industry. Their flight, performed in the [Wright Flyer](/wiki/Wright_Flyer "Wright Flyer")
 during 1903,[\[1\]](#cite_note-NewarkDailyAdvocate_19031228-1)
 was just 11 years before what is often defined as the world's first airliner.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Tise-2)
 By the 1960s, airliners had expanded capabilities, making a significant impact on global society, economics, and politics.[\[3\]](#cite_note-Bernardo-3)

[Sikorsky Ilya Muromets](/wiki/Sikorsky_Ilya_Muromets "Sikorsky Ilya Muromets")

During 1913, [Igor Sikorsky](/wiki/Igor_Sikorsky "Igor Sikorsky")
 developed the first large multi-engine airplane, the [Russky Vityaz](/wiki/Sikorsky_Russky_Vityaz "Sikorsky Russky Vityaz")
.[\[4\]](#cite_note-4)
[\[5\]](#cite_note-5)
 This aircraft was subsequently refined into the more practical [Ilya Muromets](/wiki/Sikorsky_Ilya_Muromets "Sikorsky Ilya Muromets")
, being furnished with dual controls for a pilot and copilot and a comfortable [cabin](/wiki/Aircraft_cabin "Aircraft cabin")
 with a lavatory, cabin heating and lighting.[\[6\]](#cite_note-ASM0807-6)
 This large four-engine biplane was further adapted into an early [bomber aircraft](/wiki/Bomber_aircraft "Bomber aircraft")
, preceding subsequent transport and bomber aircraft.[\[6\]](#cite_note-ASM0807-6)
 It first flew on 10 December 1913 and took off for its first demonstration flight with 16 passengers aboard on 25 February 1914. However, it was never used as a commercial airliner due to the onset of the [First World War](/wiki/First_World_War "First World War")
 which led to military applications being prioritised.[\[7\]](#cite_note-7)
[\[8\]](#cite_note-igo40-8)

### Interwar period

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Interwar period")\
\]

In 1919, shortly after the end of the First World War, large numbers of ex-military aircraft flooded the market. One such aircraft was the French [Farman F.60 Goliath](/wiki/Farman_F.60_Goliath "Farman F.60 Goliath")
, which had originally been designed as a long-range [heavy bomber](/wiki/Heavy_bomber "Heavy bomber")
; a number were converted for commercial use into passenger airliners starting in 1919, being able to accommodate a maximum of 14 seated passengers. and around 60 were built. Initially, several publicity flights were made, including one on 8 February 1919, when the Goliath flew 12 passengers from [Toussus-le-Noble](/wiki/Toussus-le-Noble "Toussus-le-Noble")
 to [RAF Kenley](/wiki/RAF_Kenley "RAF Kenley")
, near [Croydon](/wiki/Croydon "Croydon")
, despite having no permission from the British authorities to land. Dozens of early airlines subsequently procured the type.[\[9\]](#cite_note-aeroplane1015-9)
 One high-profile flight, made on 11 August 1919, involved an F.60 flying eight passengers and a ton of supplies from Paris via [Casablanca](/wiki/Casablanca "Casablanca")
 and [Mogador](/wiki/Mogador "Mogador")
 to Koufa, 180 km (110 mi) north of [Saint-Louis, Senegal](/wiki/Saint-Louis,_Senegal "Saint-Louis, Senegal")
, flying more than 4,500 km (2,800 mi).[\[10\]](#cite_note-10)

Another important airliner built in 1919 was the [Airco DH.16](/wiki/Airco_DH.16 "Airco DH.16")
; a redesigned [Airco DH.9A](/wiki/Airco_DH.9A "Airco DH.9A")
 with a wider [fuselage](/wiki/Fuselage "Fuselage")
 to accommodate an enclosed cabin seating four passengers, plus pilot in an open cockpit. In March 1919, the prototype first flew at [Hendon Aerodrome](/wiki/Hendon_Aerodrome "Hendon Aerodrome")
. Nine aircraft were built, all but one being delivered to the nascent airline, [Aircraft Transport and Travel](/wiki/Aircraft_Transport_and_Travel "Aircraft Transport and Travel")
, which used the first aircraft for pleasure flying, and on 25 August 1919, it inaugurated the first scheduled international airline service from London to Paris.[\[11\]](#cite_note-Jackson_Civil_V2_p62-11)
 One aircraft was sold to the River Plate Aviation Company in [Argentina](/wiki/Argentina "Argentina")
, to operate a cross-river service between [Buenos Aires](/wiki/Buenos_Aires "Buenos Aires")
 and [Montevideo](/wiki/Montevideo "Montevideo")
.[\[11\]](#cite_note-Jackson_Civil_V2_p62-11)
 Meanwhile, the competing [Vickers](/wiki/Vickers "Vickers")
 converted its successful First World War era bomber, the [Vickers Vimy](/wiki/Vickers_Vimy "Vickers Vimy")
, into a civilian version, the Vimy Commercial. It was redesigned with a larger-diameter fuselage (largely of [spruce](/wiki/Spruce "Spruce")
 plywood), and first flew from the Joyce Green airfield in [Kent](/wiki/Kent "Kent")
 on 13 April 1919.[\[12\]](#cite_note-Andrews_Vickersp95-12)
[\[13\]](#cite_note-Jackson_v3_p202-13)

The world's first all-metal transport aircraft was the [Junkers F.13](/wiki/Junkers_F.13 "Junkers F.13")
, which also made its first flight in 1919.[\[14\]](#cite_note-14)
 Junkers marketed the aircraft towards business travellers and commercial operators, and European entrepreneurs bought examples for their private use and business trips. Over 300 Junkers F 13s were built between 1919 and 1932.[\[15\]](#cite_note-15)
 The Dutch [Fokker](/wiki/Fokker "Fokker")
 company produced the [Fokker F.II](/wiki/Fokker_F.II "Fokker F.II")
, then the enlarged [F.III](/wiki/Fokker_F.III "Fokker F.III")
.[\[16\]](#cite_note-Flight260521p355-16)
 These were used by the Dutch airline [KLM](/wiki/KLM "KLM")
, including on its Amsterdam-London service in 1921. A relatively reliable aircraft for the era, the Fokkers were flying to destinations across Europe, including Bremen, Brussels, Hamburg, and Paris.[\[17\]](#cite_note-deLeeuw-17)

The [Handley Page](/wiki/Handley_Page "Handley Page")
 company in Britain produced the [Handley Page Type W](/wiki/Handley_Page_Type_W "Handley Page Type W")
, its first civil transport aircraft. It housed two crew in an open [cockpit](/wiki/Cockpit "Cockpit")
 and 15 passengers in an enclosed cabin. Powered by two 450 hp (340 kW) [Napier Lion](/wiki/Napier_Lion "Napier Lion")
 engines, the prototype first flew on 4 December 1919, shortly after it was displayed at the 1919 [Paris Air Show](/wiki/Paris_Air_Show "Paris Air Show")
 at [Le Bourget](/wiki/Le_Bourget "Le Bourget")
. It was ordered by the Belgian firm [Sabena](/wiki/Sabena "Sabena")
, a further ten Type Ws were [produced under license](/wiki/Licensed_production "Licensed production")
 in Belgium by [SABCA](/wiki/SABCA "SABCA")
.[\[18\]](#cite_note-18)
 In 1921 the [Air Ministry](/wiki/Air_Ministry "Air Ministry")
 ordered three aircraft, built as the W.8b, for use by [Handley Page Transport](/wiki/Handley_Page_Transport "Handley Page Transport")
, and later by [Imperial Airways](/wiki/Imperial_Airways "Imperial Airways")
, on services to [Paris](/wiki/Paris "Paris")
 and [Brussels](/wiki/Brussels "Brussels")
.[\[19\]](#cite_note-19)

In France, the [Bleriot-SPAD S.33](/wiki/Bleriot-SPAD_S.33 "Bleriot-SPAD S.33")
 was introduced during the early 1920s.[\[20\]](#cite_note-Flight070721p460-20)
 It was commercially successful, initially serving the Paris-[London](/wiki/London "London")
 route, and later on [continental](/wiki/Europe "Europe")
 routes. The enclosed cabin could carry four passengers with an extra seat in the cockpit. It was further developed into the [Blériot-SPAD S.46](/wiki/Bl%C3%A9riot-SPAD_S.46 "Blériot-SPAD S.46")
. Throughout the 1920s, companies in Britain and France were at the forefront of the civil airliner industry.[\[21\]](#cite_note-21)

By 1921, the capacity of airliners needed to be increased to achieve more favourable economics. The English company [de Havilland](/wiki/De_Havilland "De Havilland")
, built the 10-passenger [DH.29](/wiki/De_Havilland_Doncaster "De Havilland Doncaster")
 monoplane,[\[22\]](#cite_note-Jackson_Civil_V2_pageneeded-22)
 while starting work on the design of the DH.32, an eight-seater [biplane](/wiki/Biplane "Biplane")
 with a more economical but less powerful [Rolls-Royce Eagle](/wiki/Rolls-Royce_Eagle "Rolls-Royce Eagle")
 engine.[\[23\]](#cite_note-Jackson_Civil_V3_508525-23)
 For more capacity, DH.32 development was replaced by the [DH.34](/wiki/De_Havilland_DH.34 "De Havilland DH.34")
 biplane, accommodating 10 passengers.[\[24\]](#cite_note-Flight180823-24)
 A commercially successful aircraft, [Daimler Airway](/wiki/Daimler_Airway "Daimler Airway")
 ordered a batch of nine.[\[22\]](#cite_note-Jackson_Civil_V2_pageneeded-22)

The [Ford Trimotor](/wiki/Ford_Trimotor "Ford Trimotor")
 had two engines mounted on the wings and one in the nose, and a slabsided body, it carried eight passengers and was produced from 1925 to 1933.[\[25\]](#cite_note-Herrick_2004-25)
 It was an important early airliner in America. It was used by the predecessor to [Trans World Airlines](/wiki/Trans_World_Airlines "Trans World Airlines")
, and by other airlines long after production ceased. The Trimotor helped to popularise numerous aspects of modern aviation infrastructure, including paved [runways](/wiki/Runway "Runway")
, [passenger terminals](/wiki/Airport_terminal "Airport terminal")
, [hangars](/wiki/Hangar "Hangar")
, [airmail](/wiki/Airmail "Airmail")
, and [radio navigation](/wiki/Radio_navigation "Radio navigation")
.[\[25\]](#cite_note-Herrick_2004-25)
[\[26\]](#cite_note-26)
 [Pan Am](/wiki/Pan_Am "Pan Am")
 opened up transoceanic service in the late 1920s and early 1930s, based on a series of large seaplanes – the [Sikorsky S-38](/wiki/Sikorsky_S-38 "Sikorsky S-38")
 through [Sikorsky S-42](/wiki/Sikorsky_S-42 "Sikorsky S-42")
.[\[27\]](#cite_note-Johnson-27)
[\[28\]](#cite_note-Daley,_Robert_1980,_page_103-28)

By the 1930s, the airliner industry had matured and large consolidated national airlines were established with regular international services that spanned the globe, including [Imperial Airways](/wiki/Imperial_Airways "Imperial Airways")
 in Britain, [Lufthansa](/wiki/Lufthansa "Lufthansa")
 in Germany, KLM in the Netherlands, and [United Airlines](/wiki/United_Airlines "United Airlines")
 in America. Multi-engined aircraft were now capable of transporting dozens of passengers in comfort.[\[29\]](#cite_note-29)

During the 1930s, the British [de Havilland Dragon](/wiki/De_Havilland_Dragon "De Havilland Dragon")
 emerged as a short-haul, low-capacity airliner. Its relatively simple design could carry six passengers, each with 45 lb (20 kg) of luggage, on the London-Paris route on a fuel consumption of 13 gal (49 L) per hour.[\[30\]](#cite_note-30)
 The DH.84 Dragon entered worldwide service. During early August 1934, one performed the first non-stop flight between the Canadian mainland and Britain in 30 hours 55 minutes, although the intended destination had originally been [Baghdad](/wiki/Baghdad "Baghdad")
 in [Iraq](/wiki/Iraq "Iraq")
.[\[31\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTERiding1980289-31)
[\[32\]](#cite_note-racing_p265-32)
 British production of the Dragon ended in favour of the [de Havilland Dragon Rapide](/wiki/De_Havilland_Dragon_Rapide "De Havilland Dragon Rapide")
, a faster and more comfortable successor.[\[33\]](#cite_note-moss_3-33)

By November 1934, series production of the Dragon Rapide had commenced.[\[34\]](#cite_note-moss_4-34)
 De Havilland invested into advanced features including elongated rear windows, cabin heating, thickened wing tips, and a strengthened airframe for a higher gross weight of 5,500 lb (2,500 kg).[\[35\]](#cite_note-moss_5-35)
 Later aircraft were amongst the first airliners to be fitted with [flaps](/wiki/Flap_(aeronautics) "Flap (aeronautics)")
 for improved landing performance, along with downwards-facing recognition light and metal propellers, which were often retrofitted to older aircraft.[\[36\]](#cite_note-moss_6-36)
 It was also used in military roles;[\[34\]](#cite_note-moss_4-34)

 first appeared in 1935. DC-3s were produced in quantity for the [Second World War](/wiki/Second_World_War "Second World War")

Long-haul flights were expanded during the 1930s as Pan American Airways and Imperial Airways competed on [transatlantic travel](/wiki/Transatlantic_flight "Transatlantic flight")
 using fleets of [flying boats](/wiki/Flying_boat "Flying boat")
, such as the British [Short Empire](/wiki/Short_Empire "Short Empire")
 and the American [Boeing 314](/wiki/Boeing_314 "Boeing 314")
.[\[42\]](#cite_note-bogash-42)
 Imperial Airways' order for 28 Empire flying boats was viewed by some as a bold gamble.[\[43\]](#cite_note-norris_3-43)
 At the time, flying boats were the only practical means of building aircraft of such size and weight as land-based aircraft would have unfeasibly poor field performance.[\[43\]](#cite_note-norris_3-43)
 One Boeing 314, [registration NC18602](/wiki/Extended_flight_of_Pan_American_NC18602 "Extended flight of Pan American NC18602")

 and the UK for [heavy bombers](/wiki/Heavy_bomber "Heavy bomber")
.\[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")\

 British aircraft manufacturers were tied up to fulfill military requirements, and had no free capacity to address other matters though the war.[\[48\]](#cite_note-48)

The committee final report pushed four designs for the state-owned airlines [British Overseas Airways Corporation](/wiki/British_Overseas_Airways_Corporation "British Overseas Airways Corporation")
 (BOAC) and later [British European Airways](/wiki/British_European_Airways "British European Airways")
 (BEA): three piston-powered aircraft of varying sizes, and a [jet-powered](/wiki/Jet_engine "Jet engine")
 100-seat design at the request of [Geoffrey de Havilland](/wiki/Geoffrey_de_Havilland "Geoffrey de Havilland")
, involved in the first jet fighters development.

After a brief contest, the Type I design was given to the [Bristol Aeroplane Company](/wiki/Bristol_Aeroplane_Company "Bristol Aeroplane Company")
, building on a "100 ton [bomber](/wiki/Bomber "Bomber")
" submission.[\[49\]](#cite_note-Barnes324-49)
 This evolved into the [Bristol Brabazon](/wiki/Bristol_Brabazon "Bristol Brabazon")
 but this project folded in 1951 as BOAC lost interest and the first aircraft needed a costly wing re-design to accommodate the [Bristol Proteus](/wiki/Bristol_Proteus "Bristol Proteus")
 engine.[\[50\]](#cite_note-Phipp67-50)

The Type II was split between the [de Havilland Dove](/wiki/De_Havilland_Dove "De Havilland Dove")
 and [Airspeed Ambassador](/wiki/Airspeed_Ambassador "Airspeed Ambassador")
 conventional piston designs,[\[51\]](#cite_note-Phipp75-51)

 a commercial success with 445 Viscounts built.[\[53\]](#cite_note-Andrews_and_Morgan,_p._537-53)
 The Type III requirement led to the conventional [Avro Tudor](/wiki/Avro_Tudor "Avro Tudor")
 and the more ambitious [Bristol Britannia](/wiki/Bristol_Britannia "Bristol Britannia")
, although both aircraft suffered protracted developments,[\[54\]](#cite_note-Barnes347-54)
 with the latter entering service with BOAC in February 1957, over seven years following its order.[\[55\]](#cite_note-Phipp105-55)

The jet-powered Type IV became the [de Havilland Comet](/wiki/De_Havilland_Comet "De Havilland Comet")
 in 1949. It featured an aerodynamically clean design with four [de Havilland Ghost](/wiki/De_Havilland_Ghost "De Havilland Ghost")
 turbojet engines buried in the wings, a pressurised fuselage, and large square windows. On 2 May 1952, the Comet took off on the world's first [jetliner](/wiki/Jetliner "Jetliner")
 flight carrying fare-paying passengers and simultaneously inaugurated scheduled service between London and Johannesburg.[\[56\]](#cite_note-bbc-56)
[\[57\]](#cite_note-cookman195207-57)
 However, roughly one year after introduction, three Comets broke up mid-flight due to airframe [metal fatigue](/wiki/Fatigue_(material) "Fatigue (material)")
, not well understood at the time.[\[58\]](#cite_note-withey_fatigue-58)
[\[59\]](#cite_note-59)
 The Comet was grounded and tested to discover the cause, while rival manufacturers heeded the lessons learned while developing their own aircraft.[\[60\]](#cite_note-60)
 The improved Comet 2 and the prototype Comet 3 culminated in the redesigned Comet 4 series which debuted in 1958 and had a productive career over 30 years, but sales never fully recovered.[\[61\]](#cite_note-Phipp93-61)
[\[62\]](#cite_note-Jackson464-62)

By the 1960s, the UK had lost the airliner market to the US due to the Comet disaster and a smaller domestic market, not regained by later designs like the [BAC 1-11](/wiki/BAC_1-11 "BAC 1-11")
, [Vickers VC10](/wiki/Vickers_VC10 "Vickers VC10")
, and [Hawker Siddeley Trident](/wiki/Hawker_Siddeley_Trident "Hawker Siddeley Trident")
. The STAC committee was formed to consider [supersonic](/wiki/Supersonic "Supersonic")
 designs and worked with Bristol to create the [Bristol 223](/wiki/Bristol_223 "Bristol 223")
, a 100-passenger transatlantic airliner. The effort was later merged with similar efforts in France to create the [Concorde](/wiki/Concorde "Concorde")

[United Airlines](/wiki/United_Airlines "United Airlines")
 [DC-6](/wiki/Douglas_DC-6 "Douglas DC-6")
, Stapleton Airport, Denver, September 1966

The first batch of the [Douglas DC-4s](/wiki/Douglas_DC-4 "Douglas DC-4")
 went to the U.S. Army and Air Forces,\[_[when?](/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers#Chronological_items "Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers")\
_\] and was named the [C-54 Skymaster](/wiki/Douglas_C-54_Skymaster "Douglas C-54 Skymaster")
. Some ex-military DC-6s were later converted into airliners, with both passenger and cargo versions flooding the market shortly after the war's end. Douglas also developed a pressurized version of the DC-4, which it designated the [Douglas DC-6](/wiki/Douglas_DC-6 "Douglas DC-6")
. Rival company Lockheed produced the [Constellation](/wiki/Lockheed_Constellation "Lockheed Constellation")
, a triple-tailed aircraft with a wider fuselage than the DC-4.

The [Boeing 377 Stratocruiser](/wiki/Boeing_377_Stratocruiser "Boeing 377 Stratocruiser")
 was based on the [C-97 Stratofreighter](/wiki/Boeing_C-97_Stratofreighter "Boeing C-97 Stratofreighter")
 military transport, it had a double deck and a pressurized fuselage.

Convair produced the [Convair 240](/wiki/Convair_CV-240_family "Convair CV-240 family")
, a 40-person pressurized airplane; 566 examples flew. Convair later developed the [Convair 340](/wiki/Convair_CV-240_family "Convair CV-240 family")
, which was slightly larger and could accommodate between 44 and 52 passengers, of which 311 were produced. The firm also commenced work on the [Convair 37](/wiki/Convair_Model_37 "Convair Model 37")
, a relatively large double-deck airliner that would have served trans[continental](/wiki/Continent "Continent")
 routes; however, the project was abandoned due to a lack of customer demand and its high development costs.\[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")\

Rival planes include the [Martin 2-0-2](/wiki/Martin_2-0-2 "Martin 2-0-2")
 and [Martin 4-0-4](/wiki/Martin_4-0-4 "Martin 4-0-4")
, but the 2-0-2 had safety concerns and was unpressurized, while the 4-0-4 only sold around 100 units.[\[63\]](#cite_note-Jarrett-63)

During the postwar years, engines became much larger and more powerful, and safety features such as deicing, navigation, and weather information were added to the planes. American planes were allegedly more comfortable and had superior flight decks than those produced in Europe.[\[63\]](#cite_note-Jarrett-63)

In 1936, the French Air Ministry requested transatlantic flying boats that could hold at least 40 passengers, leading to three [Latécoère 631s](/wiki/Lat%C3%A9co%C3%A8re_631 "Latécoère 631")
 introduced by [Air France](/wiki/Air_France "Air France")
 in July 1947.[\[65\]](#cite_note-Aeroplane0114-65)
 However, two crashed and the third was removed from service over safety concerns. The [SNCASE Languedoc](/wiki/SNCASE_Languedoc "SNCASE Languedoc")
 was the first French post-war airliner.[\[66\]](#cite_note-Aeroplane0414-66)
 Accommodating up to 44 seats, 40 aircraft were completed for Air France between October 1945 and April 1948.[\[67\]](#cite_note-67)

The [Sud-Aviation Caravelle](/wiki/Sud-Aviation_Caravelle "Sud-Aviation Caravelle")
 was developed during the late 1950s as the first short range jet airliner. The nose and cockpit layout were licensed from the [de Havilland Comet](/wiki/De_Havilland_Comet "De Havilland Comet")
, along with some fuselage elements.[\[69\]](#cite_note-López1-69)
 Entering service in mid 1959, 172 Caravelles had been sold within four years and six versions were in production by 1963.[\[70\]](#cite_note-70)
 Sud Aviation then focused its design team on a Caravelle successor.[\[69\]](#cite_note-López1-69)

The [Super-Caravelle](/wiki/Sud_Aviation_Super-Caravelle "Sud Aviation Super-Caravelle")
 was a [supersonic transport](/wiki/Supersonic_transport "Supersonic transport")
 project of similar size and range to the Caravelle. It was merged with the similar [Bristol Aeroplane Company](/wiki/Bristol_Aeroplane_Company "Bristol Aeroplane Company")
 project into the Anglo-French [Concorde](/wiki/Concorde "Concorde")
.[\[69\]](#cite_note-López1-69)

#### USSR

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: USSR")\

Soon after the war, most of the Soviet fleet of airliners consisted of DC-3s or [Lisunov Li-2s](/wiki/Lisunov_Li-2 "Lisunov Li-2")
. These planes were in desperate need of replacement, and in 1946, the [Ilyushin Il-12](/wiki/Ilyushin_Il-12 "Ilyushin Il-12")
 made its first flight. The Il-12 was very similar in design to American Convair 240, except was unpressurized. In 1953, the [Ilyushin Il-14](/wiki/Ilyushin_Il-14 "Ilyushin Il-14")
 made its first flight, and this version was equipped with much more powerful engines. The main contribution that the Soviets made in regards to airliners was the [Antonov An-2](/wiki/Antonov_An-2 "Antonov An-2")
. This plane is a biplane, unlike most of the other airliners, and sold more units than any other transport plane.[\[63\]](#cite_note-Jarrett-63)

Engines
-------

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Engines")\
\]

Until the beginning of the [Jet Age](/wiki/Jet_Age "Jet Age")
, [piston engines](/wiki/Piston_engine "Piston engine")
 were common on [propliners](/wiki/Propliner "Propliner")
 such as the Douglas DC-3. Nearly all modern airliners are now powered by [turbine](/wiki/Gas_turbine "Gas turbine")
 engines, either [turbofans](/wiki/Turbofan "Turbofan")
 or [turboprops](/wiki/Turboprop "Turboprop")
. Gas turbine engines operate efficiently at much higher altitudes, are more reliable than piston engines, and produce less vibration and noise. The use of a common fuel type – kerosene-based jet fuel – is another advantage.

Airliner variants

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Airliner variants")\

Some variants of airliners have been developed for carrying freight or for luxury [corporate use](/wiki/Business_jet "Business jet")
. Many airliners have also been modified for government use as [VIP](/wiki/Very_Important_Person "Very Important Person")
 transports and for military functions such as airborne tankers (for example, the [Vickers VC10](/wiki/Vickers_VC10 "Vickers VC10")

Configuration
-------------

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Configuration")\
\]

Modern jetliners are usually low-wing designs with two engines mounted underneath the [swept wings](/wiki/Swept_wing "Swept wing")
, while [turboprop](/wiki/Turboprop "Turboprop")
 aircraft are slow enough to use straight wings. Smaller airliners sometimes have their engines mounted on either side of the rear fuselage. Numerous advantages and disadvantages exist due to this arrangement.[\[74\]](#cite_note-74)
 Perhaps the most important advantage to mounting the engines under the wings is that the total aircraft weight is more evenly distributed across the wingspan, which imposes less [bending moment](/wiki/Bending_moment "Bending moment")
 on the wings and allows for a lighter wing structure. This factor becomes more important as aircraft weight increases, and no in-production airliners have both a maximum takeoff weight more than 50 tons and engines mounted on the fuselage. The [Antonov An-148](/wiki/Antonov_An-148 "Antonov An-148")
 is the only in-production jetliner with high-mounted wings (usually seen in [military transport aircraft](/wiki/Military_transport_aircraft "Military transport aircraft")
), which reduces the risk of damage from unpaved runways.

Except for a few experimental or military designs, all aircraft built to date have had all of their weight [lifted](/wiki/Lift_(force) "Lift (force)")
 off the ground by airflow across the wings. In terms of [aerodynamics](/wiki/Aerodynamics "Aerodynamics")
, the fuselage has been a mere burden. [NASA](/wiki/NASA "NASA")
 and [Boeing](/wiki/Boeing "Boeing")
 are currently developing a [blended wing body](/wiki/Blended_wing_body "Blended wing body")
 design in which the entire airframe, from wingtip to wingtip, contributes lift. This promises a significant gain in [fuel efficiency](/wiki/Fuel_efficiency_in_transportation "Fuel efficiency in transportation")

Since it began, the [jet airliner](/wiki/Jet_airliner "Jet airliner")
 market had a recurring pattern of seven years of growth followed by three years of deliveries falling 30–40%, except a steady growth from 2004 due to the [economic rise of China](/wiki/Economic_history_of_China_(1949%E2%80%93present)#From_2001 "Economic history of China (1949–present)")
 going from 3% of world market in 2001 to 22% in 2015, expensive [jet fuel](/wiki/Jet_fuel "Jet fuel")
 till 2014 stimulating old jets replacement allowed by low [interest rates](/wiki/Interest_rate "Interest rate")
 since 2008, and strong [airline](/wiki/Airline "Airline")
 passenger demand since.[\[84\]](#cite_note-84)
 In 2004, 718 Airbus and Boeings were delivered, worth $39.3 billion; 1,466 are expected in 2017, worth $104.4 billion: a growth by 3.5 from 2004 to 2020 is unprecedented and highly unusual for any mature market.[\[85\]](#cite_note-85)

| Other | 31  | 0.5 | 72  | 1,080 |
| Total | 1,704 | 110.1 | 1,583 | 14,702 |

In 2016, the deliveries went for 38% in Asia-Pacific, 25% in Europe, 22% in North America, 7% in Middle East, 6% in South America and 2% in Africa. 1,020 narrowbodies were delivered and their backlog reach 10891: 4,991 A320neo, 644 A320ceo; 3,593 737 Max, 835 737NG, 348 CSeries, 305 C919 and 175 MC-21; while 398 widebodies were delivered : 137 Dreamliners and 99 B777 for Boeing (65%) against 63 A330 and 49 A350 for Airbus, more than 2,400 widebodies were in backlog, led by the A350 with 753 (31%) then the Boeing 787 with 694 (28%).[\[86\]](#cite_note-FGfleetwatch-86)

The most important driver of orders is airline [profitability](/wiki/Profitability "Profitability")
, itself driven mainly by world [GDP growth](/wiki/GDP_growth "GDP growth")
 but also [supply and demand](/wiki/Supply_and_demand "Supply and demand")
 balance and [oil prices](/wiki/Oil_price "Oil price")
, while new programmes by [Airbus and Boeing](/wiki/Airbus_and_Boeing "Airbus and Boeing")
 help to stimulate aircraft demand. In 2016, 38% of the 25 years old airliners had been retired, 50% of the 28 years old : there will be 523 aircraft reaching 25 years old in 2017, 1,127 in 2026 and 1,628 in 2041. Deliveries rose by 80% from 2004 to 2016, they represented 4.9% of the fleet in 2004 and 5.9% in 2016, down from 8% previously.[\[87\]](#cite_note-CAPA20June2017-87)
 Oil prices and [airshow](/wiki/Airshow "Airshow")
 orders are trending together.[\[88\]](#cite_note-88)

Storage can be an adjustment variable for the airliner fleet: as Jan–Apr 2018 [RPKs](/wiki/Revenue_passenger_kilometer "Revenue passenger kilometer")
 are up by 7% over a year and [FTKs](/wiki/Tonne-kilometer "Tonne-kilometer")

Main article: [Aircraft cabin](/wiki/Aircraft_cabin "Aircraft cabin")

An airliner will usually have several classes of seating: [first class](/wiki/First_class_travel "First class travel")
, [business class](/wiki/Business_class "Business class")
, and/or [economy class](/wiki/Economy_class "Economy class")
 (which may be referred to as coach class or tourist class, and sometimes has a separate "premium" economy section with more legroom and amenities). The seats in more expensive classes are wider, more comfortable, and have more amenities such as "lie flat" seats for more comfortable sleeping on long flights. Generally, the more expensive the class, the better the beverage and meal service.

Domestic flights generally have a two-class configuration, usually first or business class and coach class, although many airlines instead offer all-economy seating. International flights generally have either a two-class configuration or a three-class configuration, depending on the airline, route and aircraft type. Many airliners offer [movies or audio/video](/wiki/In-flight_entertainment "In-flight entertainment")
 on demand (this is standard in first and business class on many international flights and may be available on economy). Cabins of all classes have [lavatory](/wiki/Aircraft_lavatory "Aircraft lavatory")
 facilities, reading lights, and [air vents](/wiki/Environmental_control_system#Air_distribution "Environmental control system")
. Some larger airliners have a [rest compartment](/wiki/Crew_rest_compartment "Crew rest compartment")
 reserved for crew use during breaks.

### Seats

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=24 "Edit section: Seats")\
\]

Main article: [Airline seat](/wiki/Airline_seat "Airline seat")

The types of seats that are provided and how much legroom is given to each passenger are decisions made by the individual airlines, not the aircraft manufacturers. Seats are mounted in "tracks" on the floor of the cabin and can be moved back and forth by the maintenance staff or removed altogether. One driver of airline profitability is how many passengers can be seated in economy class cabins, meaning that airline companies have an incentive to place seats close together to fit as many passengers in as possible.[\[91\]](#cite_note-91)
 In contrast, ‘premium class’ seat configurations provide more space for travelers.[\[92\]](#cite_note-92)

Passengers seated in an **exit row** (the row of seats adjacent to an [emergency exit](/wiki/Emergency_exit "Emergency exit")
) usually have substantially more legroom than those seated in the remainder of the cabin, while the seats directly in front of the exit row may have less legroom and may not even recline (for evacuation safety reasons). However, passengers seated in an exit row may be required to assist cabin crew during an [emergency evacuation](/wiki/Emergency_evacuation "Emergency evacuation")
 of the aircraft opening the emergency exit and assisting fellow passengers to the exit. As a precaution, many airlines prohibit young people under the age of 15 from being seated in the exit row.[\[93\]](#cite_note-93)

The seats are designed to withstand strong forces so as not to break or come loose from their floor tracks during [turbulence](/wiki/Turbulence "Turbulence")
 or accidents. The backs of seats are often equipped with a fold-down tray for eating, writing, or as a place to set up a portable computer, or a music or video player. Seats without another row of seats in front of them have a tray that is either folded into the armrest or that clips into brackets on the underside of the armrests. However, seats in premium cabins generally have trays in the armrests or clip-on trays, regardless of whether there is another row of seats in front of them. Seatbacks now often feature small colour [LCD](/wiki/LCD "LCD")
 screens for videos, television and video games. Controls for this display as well as an outlet to plug in audio headsets are normally found in the armrest of each seat.

### Overhead bins

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=25 "Edit section: Overhead bins")\
\]

Further information: [Overhead storage](/wiki/Overhead_storage "Overhead storage")

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Overhead_bins_%286389156645%29.jpg/250px-Overhead_bins_%286389156645%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:Overhead_bins_(6389156645).jpg)

Overhead bins aboard a [Sukhoi Superjet 100](/wiki/Sukhoi_Superjet_100 "Sukhoi Superjet 100")

The overhead bins, also known as overhead lockers or pivot bins, are used for stowing carry-on baggage and other items. While the airliner manufacturer will normally specify a standard version of the product to supply, airlines can choose to have bins of differing size, shape, or color installed. Over time, overhead bins evolved out of what were originally overhead shelves that were used for little more than coat and briefcase storage. As concerns about falling debris during turbulence or in accidents increased, enclosed bins became\[_[when?](/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers#Chronological_items "Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers")\
_\] the norm. Bins have increased in size to accommodate the larger carry-on baggage passengers can bring onto the aircraft. Newer bin designs have included a handrail, useful when moving through the cabin.[\[94\]](#cite_note-94)

### Passenger service units

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=26 "Edit section: Passenger service units")\
\]

Above the passenger seats are [Passenger Service Units](/wiki/Passenger_Service_Unit "Passenger Service Unit")
 (PSU). These typically contain reading lights, air vents, and a flight attendant call light. On most narrowbody aircraft (and some [Airbus A300s](/wiki/Airbus_A300 "Airbus A300")
 and [A310s](/wiki/Airbus_A310 "Airbus A310")
), the flight attendant call button and the buttons to control the reading lights are located directly on the PSU, while on most widebody aircraft, the flight attendant call button and the reading light control buttons are usually part of the [in-flight entertainment](/wiki/In-flight_entertainment "In-flight entertainment")
 system. The units frequently have small "Fasten Seat Belt" and "No Smoking" illuminated signage and may also contain a speaker for the cabin public address system. On some newer aircraft, a "Turn off electronic devices" sign is used instead of the "No Smoking" sign, as smoking isn't permitted on board the aircraft anyway.

The PSU will also normally contain the drop-down [oxygen masks](/wiki/Oxygen_mask "Oxygen mask")
 which are activated if there is a sudden drop in cabin pressure. These are supplied with oxygen by means of a [chemical oxygen generator](/wiki/Chemical_oxygen_generator "Chemical oxygen generator")
. By using a chemical reaction rather than a connection to an oxygen tank, these devices supply breathing oxygen for long enough for the airliner to descend to thicker, more breathable air. Oxygen generators do generate considerable heat in the process. Because of this, the oxygen generators are thermally shielded and are only allowed in commercial airliners when properly installed – they are not permitted to be loaded as freight on passenger-carrying flights. [ValuJet Flight 592](/wiki/ValuJet_Flight_592 "ValuJet Flight 592")
 crashed on May 11, 1996, as a result of improperly loaded chemical oxygen generators.

### Cabin pressurization

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=27 "Edit section: Cabin pressurization")\
\]

Main article: [Cabin pressurization](/wiki/Cabin_pressurization "Cabin pressurization")

Airliners developed since the 1940s have had pressurized cabins (or, more accurately, pressurized hulls including baggage holds) to enable them to carry passengers safely at high altitudes where low oxygen levels and air pressure would otherwise cause sickness or death. High altitude flight enabled airliners to fly above most weather systems that cause turbulent or dangerous flying conditions, and also to fly faster and further as there is less drag due to the lower air density. Pressurization is applied using compressed air, in most cases bled from the engines, and is managed by an [environmental control system](/wiki/Environmental_control_system "Environmental control system")
 which draws in clean air, and vents stale air out through a valve.

Pressurization presents design and construction challenges to maintain the structural integrity and sealing of the cabin and hull and to prevent [rapid decompression](/wiki/Rapid_decompression "Rapid decompression")
. Some of the consequences include small round windows, [doors that open inwards and are larger than the door hole](/wiki/Plug_door "Plug door")
, and an [emergency oxygen system](/wiki/Emergency_oxygen_system "Emergency oxygen system")
.

To maintain a pressure in the cabin equivalent to an altitude close to sea level would, at a cruising altitude around 10,000 m (33,000 ft), create a pressure difference between inside the aircraft and outside the aircraft that would require greater hull strength and weight. Most people do not suffer ill effects up to an altitude of 1,800–2,500 m (5,900–8,200 ft), and maintaining cabin pressure at this equivalent altitude significantly reduces the pressure difference and therefore the required hull strength and weight. A side effect is that passengers experience some discomfort as the cabin pressure changes during ascent and descent to the majority of airports, which are at low altitudes.

### Cabin climate control

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=28 "Edit section: Cabin climate control")\
\]

The air bled from the engines is hot and requires cooling by [air conditioning](/wiki/Air_conditioning "Air conditioning")
 units. It is also extremely dry at cruising altitude, and this causes sore eyes, dry skin and [mucosa](/wiki/Mucosa "Mucosa")
 on long flights. Although [humidification](/wiki/Humidifier "Humidifier")
 technology could raise its [relative humidity](/wiki/Relative_humidity "Relative humidity")
 to comfortable middle levels, this is not done since humidity promotes [corrosion](/wiki/Corrosion "Corrosion")
 to the inside of the hull and risks [condensation](/wiki/Condensation "Condensation")
 which could [short](/wiki/Short_circuit "Short circuit")
 electrical systems, so for safety reasons it is deliberately kept to a low value, around 10%. Another problem of the air coming from the ventilation (unto which the oil lubrication system of the engines is hooked up) is that fumes from components in the synthetic oils can sometimes travel along, causing passengers, pilots and crew to be intoxicated. The illness it causes is called [aerotoxic syndrome](/wiki/Aerotoxic_syndrome "Aerotoxic syndrome")
.

Baggage holds

 on the floor and the partition labeled "Caution: Do Not Hit – Potable Water Tank Inside".

Airliners must have space on board to store "checked" baggage – that which will not safely fit in the passenger cabin.

Designed to hold baggage as well as freight, these compartments are called "cargo bins", "baggage holds", "luggage holds", or occasionally "pits". Occasionally baggage holds may be referred to as **cargo decks** on the largest of aircraft. These compartments can be accessed through doors on the outside of the aircraft.

Depending on the aircraft, baggage holds are normally inside the hull and are therefore pressurized just like the passenger cabin although they may not be heated. While lighting is normally installed for use by the loading crew, typically the compartment is unlit when the door is closed.

Baggage holds on modern airliners are equipped with fire detection equipment and larger aircraft have automated or remotely activated fire-fighting devices installed.

### Narrow-body airliners

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=30 "Edit section: Narrow-body airliners")\
\]

Most "[narrow-body](/wiki/Narrow-body_aircraft "Narrow-body aircraft")
" airliners with more than 100 seats have space below the cabin floor, while smaller aircraft often have a special compartment separate from the passenger area but on the same level.

Baggage is normally stacked within the bin by hand, sorted by destination category. Netting that fits across the width of the bin is secured to limit movement of the bags. Airliners often carry items of [freight](/wiki/Freight "Freight")
 and mail. These may be loaded separately from the baggage or mixed in if they are bound for the same destination. For securing bulky items "hold down" rings are provided to tie items into place.

### Wide-body airliners

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=31 "Edit section: Wide-body airliners")\
\]

"[Wide-body](/wiki/Wide-body_aircraft "Wide-body aircraft")
" airliners frequently have a compartment like the ones described above, typically called a "bulk bin". It is normally used for late arriving luggage or bags which may have been checked at the gate.

However, most baggage and loose freight items are loaded into containers called [Unit Load Devices](/wiki/Unit_Load_Device "Unit Load Device")
 (ULDs), often referred to as "cans". ULDs come in a variety of sizes and shapes, but the most common model is the [LD3](/wiki/LD3 "LD3")
. This particular container has approximately the same height as the cargo compartment and fits across half of its width.

ULDs are loaded with baggage and are transported to the aircraft on [dolly carts](/wiki/Ground_support_equipment#Dollies "Ground support equipment")
 and loaded into the baggage hold by a loader designed for the task. By means of [belts](/wiki/Conveyor_belt "Conveyor belt")
 and [rollers](/w/index.php?title=Roller_(machine_part)&action=edit&redlink=1 "Roller (machine part) (page does not exist)")
 an operator can maneuver the ULD from the dolly cart, up to the aircraft baggage hold door, and into the aircraft. Inside the hold, the floor is also equipped with drive wheels and rollers that an operator inside can use to move the ULD properly into place. Locks in the floor are used to hold the ULD in place during flight.

For consolidated freight loads, like a pallet of boxes or an item too oddly shaped to fit into a container, flat metal pallets that resemble large baking sheets that are compatible with the loading equipment are used.

**Have you ever traveled on a jumbo jet and wondered how people might have traveled by air before its invention?**

The Museum's collection holds a variety of different airplanes which help tell the story of flight. Our collection of commercial aircraft, such as the well-known Boeing 747, help tell the history of America by air. Learn more about some of these aircraft below. 

From the Wright Brothers to Today

The Airplane's Family Tree


------------------------------

Did you know that the parts of airplanes today can be traced directly back to the Wright Flyer and the work of Orville and Wilbur Wright? In this episode of STEM in 30, we trace the family tree of the airplane from that first flight on December 17, 1903, to today—all from inside a United Airlines 76.

Early Commercial Airliners
--------------------------

The story of commercial aviation starts with air mail. Commercial airlines initially struggled to get off the ground, but with help from the government, who awarded airlines contracts to deliver the mail, they soon began to flourish. As technology improved, aircraft evolved from World War I-style biplanes into sleek, high-performance modern airliners.

### Flying the Mail

![America by Air - Curtiss JN-4D Jenny](/sites/default/files/styles/callout_half/public/images/2007-13554h.jpg?h=ed802e08&itok=tWzV7mzM)

The Curtiss JN-4D Jenny


---------------------------

Early airlines were able to turn a profit through contracts with the federal government to fly the mail. Designed as a trainer for the U.S. Army Air Service, the Curtiss JN-4 first flew in 1916. Known popularly as the "Jenny," the JN-4 taught thousands of Allied pilots to fly during World War I. After the war, surplus Jennys were widely used for "barnstorming"—traveling air shows—and they opened the first scheduled air mail service. 

The JN-4D featured a 90-horsepower Curtiss OX-5 engine. The Army ordered Curtiss to convert six JN-4Ds for the U.S. Air Mail Service by installing a larger 150-horsepower Hispano-Suiza engine and a mail compartment. These airplanes were redesignated as JN-4Hs. The Smithsonian acquired this Jenny in 1918.

### Who is Jenny?

The airplane's official name is the Curtiss JN-4. If you say the letters "JN" out loud, they sound like "Jay-En."  
That was shortened to "Jen," and it eventually was changed to "Jenny."

Of the more than 200 pilots hired by the Post Office from 1918 to 1926, 35 died flying the mail. Fatalities dropped after the first few years, but flying the mail remained a dangerous-and sometimes deadly-job.

[![View of red, U.S. Air Mail postage stamp that has an error of the Jenny biplane facing upside down.](/sites/default/files/styles/body_large/public/images/14102h.jpg?itok=MBm-nefV)](/multimedia-gallery/14102hjpg)

The Post Office created a series of air mail stamps featuring the Jenny when it began flying the mail. Post Office printers made a mistake when they first printed this stamp. Today very few of these rare "upside-down Jenny" stamps still exist. These famous stamps are worth a lot of money. 

![De Havilland DH-4](/sites/default/files/styles/callout_half/public/images/tours/2006-25885h.jpg?h=44fd8ce7&itok=wP07Zr8D)

De Havilland DH-4


---------------------

By 1921 modified de Havilland DH-4 light bombers were being used as mail planes. They soon become the symbol of the U.S. Air Mail Service. 

The DH-4 in the Museum's collection was the prototype American-built DH-4, manufactured by the Dayton-Wright Airplane Company. This airplane was used in more than 2,600 experiments until its retirement in April 1919. On May 13, 1918, Orville Wright made his last flight as a pilot in a 1911 Wright Model B alongside this DH-4, flown by Howard Max Rinehart. He then made a flight as a passenger in the DH-4 with Rinehart.

### Flying Passengers

Many [early airlines](https://airandspace.si.edu/stories/editorial/early-airlines-you-might-not-have-heard)
 attempted to make a profitable business from transporting passengers, but every one of these efforts failed due to high operating costs. Even after the government gave private airlines contracts to fly the mail, it was still difficult for airlines to make passenger flight profitable—resulting in [further subsidies](https://airandspace.si.edu/stories/editorial/air-mail-and-birth-commercial-aviation)
 from the federal government to encourage airlines to carry more passengers.

[![Wooden biplane-airboat model with space for two people, a passenger and the pilot. Flaglets are placed on the front structure in between the wings.](/sites/default/files/styles/body_large/public/images/14081h.jpg?itok=Zl93ospv)](/multimedia-gallery/14081hjpg)

A model of the Benoist Model XIV. The Benoist was powered by a Roberts 75-horsepower, 6-cylinder, water-cooled engine. In 1914, the trip across the bay cost $5—more than $100 today. 

### Benoist Model XIV

Many early airlines utilized flying boats for passenger service. The St. Petersburg-Tampa Airboat Line began flying across Tampa Bay on January 1, 1914. The flight covered 29 kilometers (18 miles) and took 23 minutes—11 hours less than traveling between St. Petersburg and Tampa by rail. The airline purchased a Model XIV from St. Louis aircraft manufacturer Thomas Benoist. The airplane could carry one passenger, who sat next to the pilot in the open cockpit.

Ford Tri-Motor


------------------

Affectionately known as the “Tin Goose,” the Ford Tri-Motor was the largest civil aircraft in America when it first flew on August 2, 1926. Its all-metal, corrugated aluminum construction and the prestigious Ford name made it immediately popular with passengers and airline operators. Noisy but reliable, the Ford Tri-Motor played a major role in convincing the public that air travel was safe and practical.

### Curtiss Condor 

First flown in 1932, the Curtiss Condor could carry 14 passengers and had sleeping berths for night flight. Although comfortable and fast, it was expensive to operate. Eastern Air Transport and American Airways flew the Condor, but newer designs soon replaced it.

A model of the Boeing 40A.

### Boeing 40A

Powered by Pratt & Whitney's Wasp engine, the Boeing 40A could carry two passengers. Thanks to the biplane's large payload capacity and low operating costs, Boeing Air Transport won the coveted air mail route from Chicago to San Francisco in 1927 and operated the route at a profit.

Boeing developed a larger version of the aircraft, the Boeing 40B, which could carry 4,400 kilograms (2,000 pounds) of mail and four passengers. The pilot flew the airplane from an open cockpit behind the passenger compartment.

The First Modern Airliners
--------------------------

With help from the government via air mail contracts and other subsidies, commercial aviation in the United States began to take route. However, the mid-1930s were a difficult time for airlines. The federal government had broken up the large companies that had dominated the aviation industry and had cut its subsidies to airlines. Air transportation regulation was in a state of confusion. Improvements in aircraft and aviation technology played a key role in revitalizing the struggling airline industry.

To survive in these challenging times, airlines needed bigger, better, and faster airplanes that could profitably fly passengers as well as mail. New navigation and communications equipment was also required to enhance safety and efficiency. The aviation industry responded. By the late 1930s, the first modern, high-performance airliners were taking to the air.

![Image of the Boeing 247-D](/sites/default/files/styles/callout_half/public/images/image-albums/Boeing%20247-D.jpg?h=1dd3cf61&itok=wQeo249y)

Boeing 247


--------------

The government provided bonuses to airlines if their aircraft could fly at night or had multiple engines, two-way radios, and other equipment that promoted safety and speed. The first aircraft produced under these terms was the Boeing 247 in 1933, the world's first modern airliner. It could carry 10 passengers, fly 50 percent faster than the Ford Tri-Motor, and cross the country in less than 20 hours. The Boeing 247 revolutionized air transportation, featuring a sleek, low-wing, all-metal construction; retractable landing gear; and supercharged, air-cooled engines. Its innovative design launched a new generation of commercial airliners, notably the Douglas DC-2. The Boeing 247-D, the version in the Museum's collection, pioneered the use of controllable-pitch propellers and wing de-icer boots.

A model of the China Clipper. When the _China Clipper_ opened Pan Am's transpacific air mail route in 1935 and passenger service in 1936, it became one of the most famous airplanes in the world. Pan Am's other flying boats were known as the _Hawaii Clipper_ and the _Philippine Clipper_.

### China Clipper

The _China Clipper_ was the name of one of three Martin M-130 flying boats built for Pan American Airways, the United States' primary international airline during the 1930s. The Martin M-130 was the first airliner that could fly nonstop the 3,840-kilometer (2,400-mile) distance between San Francisco and Honolulu, Hawaii—the longest major route in the world without and emergency intermediate landing field. The _China Clipper_ and its sister ships demonstrated that there were no technological barriers to transoceanic travel.

Boeing 307 Stratoliner


--------------------------

The Boeing 307 Stratoliner was the world's first pressurized airliner. While other airliners flew no higher than about 3,000 meters (10,000 feet), the Stratoliner could cruise at 7,500 meters (25,000 feet). By ascending "above the weather," it could fly faster and more efficiently and provide its 33 passengers a smoother and quieter ride. Because of the onset of World War II and the development of improved designs, only 10 Stratoliners were built. The last one, Pan American's Clipper Flying Cloud, is housed in the Museum's collection.

### Four-Engine Propeller Planes

Aircraft manufacturers introduced a new generation of large, four-engine airliners after World War II that soon dominated U.S. and international air travel and helped lower fares. These new airliners were built with profitable transcontinental air routes in mind. They enabled airlines to carry far more people at greater speeds, while providing unprecedented comfort for passengers and unprecedented profits for airlines. As a result, competition increased and fares fell, thus opening up air travel to even more people.

[![Lockheed Super Constellation L-1049F](/sites/default/files/styles/body_large/public/images/4485h.jpg?itok=IR0qiF20 "Lockheed Super Constellation L-1049F")](/multimedia-gallery/4485hjpg)

The Museum's "Connie" was used by the military. It was retired in 1977 after 21½ years of military service, thousands of flying hours, and countless ocean crossings.

### Lockheed Constellation and Super Constellation

Sleek, powerful, and graceful, TWA's Lockheed Constellations introduced pressurized comfort and shortened transcontinental travel by an astounding five hours. Eastern began flying the "stretched" 71-seat Super Constellation in 1951. The L-1049C and strengthened L-1049G versions had greater range and capacity than the original "Connie." Northwest Orient and TWA also flew Super Constellations.

Douglas DC-7


----------------

The Douglas DC-7 was an advanced development of the DC-6B piston-engine airliner. It was introduced by American Airlines on its New York-Los Angeles route in November 1953 and was the first airliner to provide nonstop transcontinental service in both directions. 

The fastest transport aircraft in service, the DC-7 cruised at 580 kilometers (360 miles) per hour. A total of 338 DC-7s of all types were purchased by 18 different airlines. Like other piston-engine airliners, it was made obsolete by the introduction of turbine-engine Boeing 707s and Douglas DC-8s. Some DC-7s later served as cargo and charter planes. 

This nose section from the Museum's collection is from American Airlines' Flagship Vermont, which carried about 130,000 passengers in its nearly 13,500 hours aloft.

Jet Airliners
-------------

The jet engine revolutionized air travel. Powerful and durable, jets enabled aircraft manufacturers to build bigger, faster, and more productive airliners. Jet technology also enabled airlines to reduce their operating costs and their airfares. Jet passenger service began in the United States in the late 1950s with the introduction of Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8 airliners. 

Jet engines have far fewer moving parts than piston engines, so they are more reliable, safer, and less costly to operate. They burn kerosene, which is less expensive than gasoline, and produce tremendous thrust for their weight. As a result, jet aircraft can be made larger and can fly faster than piston-engine aircraft.

First introduced in 1948, the Rolls-Royce Dart turboprop combined the power of jet propulsion with the efficiency of propellers. It was widely used in the first generation of turboprop-powered aircraft, including the British Vickers Viscount and the Dutch Fokker F-27. The Dart enabled these and other new airliners to lower airline operating costs and bring greater speed and comfort to passengers traveling on short-to-medium length routes.

Boeing 707


--------------

On July 15, 1954, a graceful, swept-winged aircraft, bedecked in brown and yellow paint and powered by four revolutionary new engines first took to the sky above Seattle. Built by the Boeing Aircraft Company, the 367-80, better known as the Dash 80, would come to revolutionize commercial air transportation when its developed version entered service as the famous Boeing 707, America's first jet airliner.

Boeing's 707 was designed for transcontinental or one-stop transatlantic range. But modified with extra fuel tanks and more efficient turbofan engines, 707-300s could fly nonstop across the Atlantic. Boeing built 855 707s. 

_Pictured: The Museum's Boeing 367-80, or Dash 80, the prototype for the Boeing 707._

An operating, 1/4-scale model of a Pratt & Whitney JT3C (military designation J57) turbojet engine.

The Pratt & Whitney JT3 revolutionized air transportation when it entered service on the Boeing 707 in 1958. The new turbojet engine was a commercial version of the U.S. Air Force's J53, introduced in 1950. In the early 1960s, the JT3 was modified into a low-bypass turbofan-the JT3D. The first three compressor stages were replaced with two fan stages, which extended beyond the compressor casing to act like propellers. The resulting increase in airflow lowered fuel consumption, noise, and emissions. JT3Ds became widely used, especially on long-range Boeing 707-300s and Douglas DC-8s.

Boeing 747


--------------

Designed originally for Pan American to replace the 707, the giant Boeing 747 revolutionized long-distance air travel when it entered service in 1970. Carrying more than twice the passengers than the 189-seat 707, the 400-seat 747 offered dramatically lower seat-mile costs and therefore much greater efficiency. Propelled by four powerful and efficient high-bypass turbofan engines, the so-called "Jumbo Jet" spawned a new generation of wide-body airliners from Airbus, Lockheed, McDonnell Douglas, and later Boeing. 

The Boeing 747 generated great public interest because of its enormous size. Airlines offered spacious legroom, piano bars, and lounges aboard their 747s to encourage passengers to fly. These amenities quickly disappeared in the face of economic reality and were replaced by revenue-producing seats. 

First flown in 1970, the Museum's 747 was the first built for Northwest and the first 747 to open service across the Pacific. It was retired in 1999. 

[Look inside the Museum's 747](https://airandspace.si.edu/multimedia-gallery/v20170188004-panojpg)

If the entire Boeing 747 were on display, its tail would extend all the way back to the far wall of the _Boeing Milestones of Flight Hall_. Note: configuration of the Museum's galleries are subject to change.

### Varying Versions

In response to market requirements, the design of the Boeing 747 has evolved through a series of models that have greater range or capacity. The 747-400 can fly 416 passengers a range of 13,450 kilometers (8,360 miles). It features an extended upper deck and winglets. The 747-8 adds about 5.6 meters (18 feet) of fuselage and has engines derived from the Boeing 787. It can carry about 467 people a distance of 14,800 kilometers (9,200 miles).

Concorde


------------

The future of commercial aviation appeared to be the supersonic transport (SST), an airliner that could fly faster than sound. U.S. advocates hoped to build a larger and faster SST to compete with the British and French Concorde and the Soviet Tupolev Tu-144.  

But concerns about huge development and operational costs, high fuel consumption, drastically high fares, and sonic booms and other environmental issues proved insurmountable. U.S. airlines placed no orders for Boeing's 2707 SST, Congress withdrew support, and the project died. 

Introduced in 1976, the Concorde was the first and only operational supersonic transport. It could carry 100 passengers across the Atlantic in less than four hours, but its airfares were extremely expensive. All 14 Concordes that went into service were purchased by the British and French governments for their national airlines. Concordes stopped flying in 2003.

A Supersonic Dead End? Not so Fast.


---------------------------------------

Fifty years after the Concorde first flew, a new era of innovation and entrepreneurial ideas seeks to make supersonic flight practical and sustainable. Flying passengers at twice the speed of sound, the Concorde captured the imagination of millions, but was retired in 2003 — so what's next for supersonic flight? From reducing the sonic boom to a quiet thump to the possible pathways for supersonic to return to commercial aviation, join us for a discussion on the supersonic airliner that started it all and where we’re headed next.

CNN  — 

Putting prisoners of war in front of reporters and news cameras is almost certainly a violation of international humanitarian law.

But Ukraine clearly felt any reputational damage it might suffer by doing so in a news conference this week would be outweighed by the fact that it featured two alleged captured fighters from China.

There was more value in giving them a platform to speak, the argument presumably ran, than protecting them “against insult and public curiosity” – something the International Committee of the Red Cross says includes protection from the media.

China has always claimed neutrality in [Russia’s war on Ukraine](https://www.cnn.com/world/europe/ukraine)
 and repeatedly tells its citizens not to get involved in foreign conflicts. They had been fighting for only three days.

The role of foreign fighters
----------------------------

Foreign fighters have been a part of this war – on both sides – since the beginning.

A list seen by CNN showing non-Russian POWs held by Ukraine as of the end of 2024 showed six Sri Lankan nationals, seven from Nepal, plus individuals from Somalia, Republic of Congo, Sierra Leone, Egypt and Syria, as well as about a dozen from former Soviet republics.

In January, Ukraine also captured two North Koreans, part of an estimated force of about 14,000 troops sent by Pyongyang to help Moscow’s war effort.

A source at Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence told CNN that Russia needed its foreign fighters because it was now locked into a war of attrition.

“It is unable to maintain the long front line with its own soldiers alone and is taking every opportunity to recruit whoever it can,” the source said.

Since the announcement of the Chinese men’s capture last week – which was followed by Ukraine declaring it had information on a further 155 Chinese citizens fighting for Russia – considerable interest has focused on how they were recruited and whether China’s government had played an active role in some way.

Certainly, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky did nothing to tamp down such speculation when asked by reporters whether he thought the presence of Chinese nationals in Ukraine was the result of official Beijing policy.

“I don’t have an answer to this question yet. [](#maincontent)

CNN has seen a Russian military contract signed by a separate Chinese fighter which gives a possible indication of what the two POWs had agreed to.

The contract, which was shown to CNN by a Ukrainian intelligence source, is written in Russian. The Security Service of Ukraine will work on it,” he said last week, adding, “We are not saying that someone gave any command, we do not have such information.”

But Zelensky went on to say that Kyiv believed that Beijing was aware of what was happening.

![A man rides his bicycle past the building of the Chinese embassy in Kyiv on April 8, 2025.](https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2208587347.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill)

The POWs were at pains to indicate otherwise, both saying that they were acting as individuals, pointing to slick recruitment videos posted to TikTok as the source of their inspiration.

One such clip has been circulating on Chinese social media networks for more than a year and appears to have originally been created for a domestic Russian audience, with Chinese subtitles added later.

It shows what appear to be Russian soldiers training and dressed in combat fatigues in the field. “You’re a man, be a man,” it says in Russian, alongside Chinese subtitles, which also explain the payments on offer for signing up.

It is impossible to say if the subtitles were added by an official entity or by social media users, but one of the men said the videos resonated in China, where military prowess is highly prized, but opportunities for direct combat experience are rare.

Why the timing matters
----------------------

Though Ukraine has hosted news conferences with POWs previously, including one involving combatants from Nepal and several African countries, its decision to platform its Chinese POWs is still unusual.

The timing is important.

It comes amid Kyiv’s attempts to get the upper hand in its battle with Moscow for the ear of US President [Donald Trump](https://www.cnn.com/politics/president-donald-trump-47)
, whose administration appears to be making little headway in its efforts to convince the Kremlin to agree to a full ceasefire.

Washington has also been heavily focused on China, which some in the White House see as the United States’ main global adversary, and which the administration has been hitting with progressively larger import tariffs.

From Zelensky’s perspective, there is a clear interest in amplifying anything that suggests China’s support for Russia might be more than diplomatic and economic.

But it might not just be the US that Ukraine’s leader is sending a message to.

Anders Puck Nielsen of the Royal Danish Defence College believes Kyiv is also anxious about recent European Union overtures to China, as the two economic powerhouses look for possible joint solutions in the face of Trump’s trade wars.

“Suddenly it seems there might be potential for the Europeans and the Chinese to find common ground on other questions as well,” Nielsen told CNN.

“It has clearly been a political move to really emphasize this aspect (of Chinese fighters in the Russian army),” he added.

Beijing certainly saw it like that.

“We urge the relevant parties concerned to correctly and soberly understand the role of China and to not release irresponsible remarks,” foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian said, without mentioning names.

Ad Feedback One of the men recounted the chaotic moments that lead up to their capture in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine.

“When we reached a forest, my captain told me, ‘Da, da, da’ (“Yes, yes, yes” in Russian), signaling me to start the attack. Then I saw the captain of (another Russian unit) throw in a grenade, and suddenly there were (Ukrainian) drones everywhere.”

The men surrendered. The prospect of 250,000 rubles (around $3,000) per month in Russia was more than double what he could expect to earn at home.

As someone with experience in medical rehabilitation, he said he told the recruiter he wanted to do the same with the Russian military. But when he got to Moscow, he was forced into training for a combat role.

Documents were only in Russian, which neither man said they understood."

Moscow stages largest Victory Day parade since start of Ukraine war with Putin using celebrations to justify invasion

Russian troops fighting in [Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine)
 have marched with Chinese forces on Moscow’s Red Square to mark the 80th anniversary of Nazi Germany’s defeat in a Victory Day celebration marked by greater spectacle than in recent years.

After several scaled-back Victory Days – with reduced military displays and few foreign guests – [Vladimir Putin](https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin)
 on Friday addressed the largest parade since his 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

“The Soviet Union took upon itself the most ferocious, merciless blows of the enemy,” the Russian president said of the victory over Nazi Germany, before turning to his invasion of Ukraine. “For now, he is stalling for time,” he said.

Chinese troops march through Moscow’s Red Square during the Victory Day parade in on Friday. The entire country, society and people support the participants of the special military operation,” Putin said, using the Kremlin’s preferred term to describe the war.

While Putin was presiding over the parade, EU foreign ministers and Britain’s David Lammy travelled to Lviv in Ukraine where they announced the establishment of a tribunal for Russian war crimes. The Kremlin presented the turnout as proof that it is not isolated, even four years into its war in Ukraine.

Other guests included leaders from fellow autocracies and pariah regimes, such as the military juntas from Myanmar and Burkina Faso.

Putin also thanked a visiting North Korean military delegation – a sign of deepening ties and new geopolitical realities after recent [admissions from both sides](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/28/north-korea-troops-fighting-for-russia-ukraine-confirmed-kim-jong-un)
 that North Korean troops have been fighting alongside Russian forces in Ukraine.

!Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin sitting side by side <image:3185>[View image in fullscreen](#img-2)

Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin at the Victory Day parade in Moscow. “We have the chance at this historic moment to make our commercial relationship grow a lot,” he said.

This year’s parade featured an expanded military presence, with a fleet of tanks rolling across Red Square alongside rocket launchers, TOS-2 Tosochka heavy flamethrower systems and Iskander ballistic missiles – all weapons used in the war in Ukraine. But since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion, the Kremlin’s mass propaganda machine has given it new meaning, with Putin using the celebrations to justify the current war.

Seated not far from Putin were several high-profile veterans of the war in Ukraine, while Russian media reported that more than 1,500 troops who took part in the invasion participated in the march.

Putin has weaponised the legacy of the second world war to mobilise support for his invasion, falsely portraying Zelenskyy, who is Jewish, as a leader resurrecting nazism in Ukraine.

Andrei Kolesnikov, a Moscow-based political analyst, said: “Victory Day is by far the most important celebration for Putin – it’s an ideological event designed to rally the nation around him. Zelenskyy dismissed the offer as self-serving and meaningless unless it was extended to 30 days, in line with a US-backed proposal that Putin has so far rejected.

In the lead-up to Victory Day, Ukraine significantly increased its drone attacks on Moscow and surrounding regions, causing airport closures and logistical chaos.

Russian troops who were involved in the war in Ukraine march in columns during a Victory Day parade. As many observers had predicted, Kyiv appeared to refrain from targeting Moscow on the day of the parade, probably owing to the presence of high-profile international dignitaries.

Still, fighting continued near the frontlines, with Moscow accusing Ukrainian forces of attempting to breach the border in Russia’s Kursk and Belgorod regions.

This year’s parade comes at what many see as a crossroads moment for Moscow, as the Trump administration steps up its efforts to persuade Putin to end the war."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that the claim is partially accurate. The image is of an airliner. The web search results confirm the involvement of the Red Cross Society of China in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the Chinese Red Cross troops have changed into winter clothes and set off for the Russian-Ukrainian front to aid Russia in rescuing its occupied territories. The evidence also shows that Chinese nationals were captured fighting for Russia in Ukraine and that Chinese troops marched with Russian forces in Moscow's Victory Day parade.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported, but the specific details about the troops' attire and mission are not confirmed by the evidence.

Insufficient information is available to verify the claim's veracity.

BEIJING, March 7 (Reuters) - China's Red Cross will provide humanitarian aid to Ukraine "as soon as possible", Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Monday, as he praised his country's friendship with Russia as "rock solid".

China has refused to condemn Russia's attack on Ukraine or call it an invasion while asking Western countries to respect Russia's "legitimate security concerns."

Wang said the causes of the "Ukraine situation" were "complex" and had not happened overnight, noting, using a traditional Chinese expression, that "three feet of ice does not form in a single day".

"Solving complex problems requires calmness and rationality, rather than adding fuel to the fire and intensifying contradictions," he told a news conference on the sidelines of the annual meeting of China's parliament.

China has already done "some work" to promote peace talks and has all along been in contact with all sides, he added.

"China is willing to continue to play a constructive role in pushing for peace and promoting talks, and is willing to work with the international community to carry out necessary mediation when needed."

China is willing to continue to make its own efforts to resolve the humanitarian crisis and the country's Red Cross will "as soon as possible" provide a batch of aid to Ukraine, Wang said, without giving details. influence and said they would have "no 'forbidden' areas of cooperation".

Wang said the friendship between China and Russia was "rock solid" and prospects for cooperation bright.

"No matter how sinister the international situation is, both China and Russia will maintain their strategic determination and continuously push forward the comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination in the new era."

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:6> This image shows the Chinese Communist Party's Red Cross troops in Russia who have changed into winter clothes and set off for the Russian-Ukrainian front to aid Russia in rescuing its occupied territories."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:6>)
web_search("Chinese Red Cross troops Russia Ukraine")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The reverse image search found the image on Wikipedia ([Airliner - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airliner)) and Merriam-Webster ([AIRLINER Definition & Meaning - Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/airliner)). The Wikipedia article discusses airliners, while the Merriam-Webster entry defines the word "airliner". The Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum ([The Evolution of the Commercial Airliner](https://airandspace.si.edu/explore/stories/evolution-commercial-airliner)) also features the image and discusses the evolution of commercial airliners. <image:6>


### Evidence from `web_search`
CNN published an article on April 16, 2025, discussing the capture of Chinese nationals fighting for Russia in Ukraine, including an image of a captured Chinese national (<image:6>). The Guardian reported on May 9, 2025, that Chinese troops marched with Russian forces in Moscow's Victory Day parade (<image:3184>, <image:3185>, <image:3188>). The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and the International Committee of the Red Cross published a report on the Red Cross Red Crescent Movement's response to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, mentioning the involvement of the Russian Red Cross Society and the Red Cross Society of China.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the claim is partially accurate. The image is of an airliner. The web search results confirm the involvement of the Red Cross Society of China in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the Chinese Red Cross troops have changed into winter clothes and set off for the Russian-Ukrainian front to aid Russia in rescuing its occupied territories. The evidence also shows that Chinese nationals were captured fighting for Russia in Ukraine and that Chinese troops marched with Russian forces in Moscow's Victory Day parade.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported, but the specific details about the troops' attire and mission are not confirmed by the evidence.

Insufficient information is available to verify the claim's veracity.

**Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping praised the deep ties between their countries, during a meeting in Beijing.**

China has become a vital partner for Russia, as it seeks to soften the impact of sanctions imposed by the US and other countries over the Ukraine war.

Is China providing Russia with weapons?
---------------------------------------

China has repeatedly denied allegations that it supplies Russia with weapons.

In an [interview with BBC News](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-68905475)
, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said: "What's not happening is the provision of actual arms by China to Russia for use in Ukraine."

However, China has been accused of building up Moscow's war machine by providing critical components.

Mr Blinken said: "Those are being used to help Russia on what's an extraordinary crash course effort to make more munitions, tanks, armoured vehicles, missiles."

About 70% of the machine tools and 90% of the microelectronics Russia imports come from China, he added.

! It said one exported components for drones, while others helped Moscow bypass Western sanctions on other technologies.

China [defends its trade with Moscow](https://www.mfa.gov.cn/eng/zxxx_662805/202305/t20230510_11074402.html)
 by saying it is not selling lethal arms and "prudently handles the export of dual-use items in accordance with laws and regulations".

Beijing [exports more than $300m](https://carnegieendowment.org/russia-eurasia/politika/2024/05/behind-the-scenes-chinas-increasing-role-in-russias-defense-industry?lang=en)
 worth of dual-use items - those with both commercial and military applications - to Russia every month, according to an analysis of Chinese customs data by the Carnegie Endowment think tank.

It says the list includes what the US has designated as "high priority" items, which are necessary for making weapons, from drones to tanks.

RUSI, a UK-based think tank has also cautioned about the [potential use of Chinese satellite technology](https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/hi-tech-high-risk-russo-chinese-cooperation-emerging-technologies)
 for intelligence on Ukraine's front line.

How much has trade between China and Russia increased?
------------------------------------------------------

Beijing has become Moscow's key supplier of cars, clothing, raw materials and many other products, after Western countries imposed sanctions on Russia.

Trade between China and Russia reached a record $240bn (£191bn) in 2023, up more than 64% since 2021 - before Russia's invasion of Ukraine - according to official figures from China.

Russian imports from China were $111bn and its exports to China $129bn, the figures show.

At their meeting in Beijing in May, Mr Xi and Mr Putin highlighted that the two nations now use their own currencies for 90% of trade, instead of US dollars.

Mr Putin also said he welcomes Chinese carmakers in Russia - after the US announced a [quadrupling of tariffs on China's electric vehicles, to 100%](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-69004520)
. The export of Chinese cars and parts to Russia reached $23bn in 2023 - up from $6bn the previous year.

He also spoke of "large-scale mutual projects" between the two countries, including plans to jointly build planes and helicopters.

"Russian natural gas is fuelling numerous Chinese households, and Chinese-made automobiles are running on Russian roads," [said China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi in March](https://www.mfa.gov.cn/eng/zxxx_662805/202403/t20240308_11256414.html#:~:text=Russian%20natural%20gas%20is%20fueling,China%2DRussia%20mutually%20beneficial%20cooperation.)
.

As Beijing boosts its electric vehicle industry domestically, Moscow has become a top destination for petrol models

However, some experts consider this a "lopsided" relationship in which [Russia is more dependent on China than vice versa](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/china-russia-relationship-xi-putin-taiwan-ukraine)
.

As of 2023, China has become Russia's top trade partner, while Russia is China's sixth-largest trade partner.

How much oil and gas does China buy from Russia?
------------------------------------------------

Almost half of all the Russian government's annual revenues come from oil and gas.

Its sales to the US, UK and EU countries have plummeted since the invasion, because of sanctions.

*   [Who is buying Russian oil and gas?](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-60783874)
    

A significant amount of this shortfall has been made up with increased sales to Asia - in particular, China and India.

In 2023, Russia surpassed Saudi Arabia to become China's top crude oil supplier. Beijing imported 107 million tonnes of crude oil from Moscow - a 24% increase from 2022.

The G7 group of "advanced" economies, along with the European Union and Australia, has also tried to limit Russia earnings by imposing a worldwide cap on the price of its oil transported by sea.

However, China has continued to buy Russian crude at above the price of the cap.

India, which has continued to maintain its decades-old relationship with Russia, has also been a major buyer of its discounted oil since the invasion.

Russia's share of India's total oil imports hit a record high of 44% in June 2023, [according to the Bank of Baroda](https://www.bankofbaroda.in/-/media/project/bob/countrywebsites/india/economic-scenario/thematic-reports/24-03/crude-imports-1-mar-24.pdf)
, an Indian state-controlled lender.

In 2023, China also imported eight million tonnes of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) from Russia, a 77% increase from 2021.

Speaking at a trade fair in Harbin on the second day of his visit to China, Mr Putin said energy ties will continue to grow and that Russia is ready to supply China with clean energy.

Moscow hopes to make progress towards finalising an agreement for a new pipeline - called the Power of Siberia 2 - to export natural gas from Russia's Siberia region to north-eastern China.

China already receives gas from Russia through the original Power of Siberia pipeline, which has been in use since 2019.

UN ambassador: Spy balloon did have impact on US-China relationship

08:57

CNN  — 

The US ambassador to the United Nations said Sunday that China would cross a “red line” if the country [decided to provide lethal military aid to Russia](https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/18/politics/us-warns-allies-china-russia/index.html)
 for its invasion of Ukraine.

“We welcome the Chinese announcement that they want peace because that’s what we always want to pursue in situations like this. But we also have to be clear that if there are any thoughts and efforts by the Chinese and others to provide lethal support to the Russians in their brutal attack against Ukraine, that that is unacceptable,” Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield told CNN’s Pamela Brown on “State of the Union.”

“That would be a red line,” she said.

As CNN previously reported, the US has begun seeing [“disturbing” trendlines](https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/18/politics/us-warns-allies-china-russia/index.html)
 in China’s support for Russia’s military, and there are signs that Beijing wants to “creep up to the line” of providing lethal military aid to Russia without getting caught, US officials familiar with the intelligence told CNN.

The officials would not describe in detail what intelligence the US has seen suggesting a recent shift in China’s posture but said US officials have been concerned enough that they have shared the intelligence with allies and partners at the Munich Security Conference over the past several days.

US Secretary of State [Antony Blinken](https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/19/politics/antony-blinken-chinese-spy-balloon/index.html)
 raised the issue when he [met with his Chinese counterpart](https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/18/china/blinken-wang-yi-munich-intl-hnk/index.html)
, Wang Yi, on Saturday on the sidelines of the conference, officials said.

“The secretary was quite blunt in warning about the implications and consequences of China providing material support to Russia or assisting Russia with systematic sanctions evasion,” a senior State Department official told reporters.

Thomas-Greenfield also reiterated Sunday that the US is prepared to “compete” with China.

“The president has said we see China as the adversary it is. We are prepared to compete with the Chinese, and we are \[prepared\], when necessary, to confront the Chinese. And that’s what we will continue to do to ensure that our national interests are always at the forefront,” she said.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:6> This image shows the Chinese Communist Party's Red Cross troops in Russia who have changed into winter clothes and set off for the Russian-Ukrainian front to aid Russia in rescuing its occupied territories."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:6>)
web_search("Chinese Red Cross troops Russia Ukraine")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The reverse image search found the image on Wikipedia ([Airliner - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airliner)) and Merriam-Webster ([AIRLINER Definition & Meaning - Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/airliner)). The Wikipedia article discusses airliners, while the Merriam-Webster entry defines the word "airliner". The Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum ([The Evolution of the Commercial Airliner](https://airandspace.si.edu/explore/stories/evolution-commercial-airliner)) also features the image and discusses the evolution of commercial airliners. <image:6>


### Evidence from `web_search`
CNN published an article on April 16, 2025, discussing the capture of Chinese nationals fighting for Russia in Ukraine, including an image of a captured Chinese national (<image:6>). The Guardian reported on May 9, 2025, that Chinese troops marched with Russian forces in Moscow's Victory Day parade (<image:3184>, <image:3185>, <image:3188>). The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and the International Committee of the Red Cross published a report on the Red Cross Red Crescent Movement's response to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, mentioning the involvement of the Russian Red Cross Society and the Red Cross Society of China.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the claim is partially accurate. The image is of an airliner. The web search results confirm the involvement of the Red Cross Society of China in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the Chinese Red Cross troops have changed into winter clothes and set off for the Russian-Ukrainian front to aid Russia in rescuing its occupied territories. The evidence also shows that Chinese nationals were captured fighting for Russia in Ukraine and that Chinese troops marched with Russian forces in Moscow's Victory Day parade.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported, but the specific details about the troops' attire and mission are not confirmed by the evidence.

Insufficient information is available to verify the claim's veracity.

===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The new evidence provides additional context. The web search indicates that China's Red Cross has offered humanitarian aid to Ukraine, but China has not condemned Russia's actions and has increased trade with Russia. The image search shows a vehicle with a Red Cross symbol.

The claim is still not fully supported. While the Red Cross Society of China is involved, the evidence does not confirm that Chinese Red Cross troops have changed into winter clothes and set off for the Russian-Ukrainian front to aid Russia in rescuing its occupied territories. The evidence suggests a more nuanced situation, with China providing humanitarian aid to Ukraine while maintaining a close relationship with Russia.

### Evidence from `web_search`
CNN published an article on April 16, 2025, discussing the capture of Chinese nationals fighting for Russia in Ukraine, including an image of a captured Chinese national (<image:6>). The Guardian reported on May 9, 2025, that Chinese troops marched with Russian forces in Moscow's Victory Day parade (<image:3184>, <image:3185>, <image:3188>).

The new evidence provides additional context. The web search indicates that China's Red Cross has offered humanitarian aid to Ukraine, but China has not condemned Russia's actions and has increased trade with Russia. The image search shows a vehicle with a Red Cross symbol.

The claim is still not fully supported. While the Red Cross Society of China is involved, the evidence does not confirm that Chinese Red Cross troops have changed into winter clothes and set off for the Russian-Ukrainian front to aid Russia in rescuing its occupied territories. The evidence suggests a more nuanced situation, with China providing humanitarian aid to Ukraine while maintaining a close relationship with Russia.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:6> This image shows the Chinese Communist Party's Red Cross troops in Russia who have changed into winter clothes and set off for the Russian-Ukrainian front to aid Russia in rescuing its occupied territories."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:6>)
web_search("Chinese Red Cross troops Russia Ukraine")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The reverse image search found the image on Wikipedia ([Airliner - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airliner)) and Merriam-Webster ([AIRLINER Definition & Meaning - Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/airliner)). The Wikipedia article discusses airliners, while the Merriam-Webster entry defines the word "airliner". The Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum ([The Evolution of the Commercial Airliner](https://airandspace.si.edu/explore/stories/evolution-commercial-airliner)) also features the image and discusses the evolution of commercial airliners. <image:6>


### Evidence from `web_search`
CNN published an article on April 16, 2025, discussing the capture of Chinese nationals fighting for Russia in Ukraine, including an image of a captured Chinese national (<image:6>). The Guardian reported on May 9, 2025, that Chinese troops marched with Russian forces in Moscow's Victory Day parade (<image:3184>, <image:3185>, <image:3188>). The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and the International Committee of the Red Cross published a report on the Red Cross Red Crescent Movement's response to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, mentioning the involvement of the Russian Red Cross Society and the Red Cross Society of China.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the claim is partially accurate. The image is of an airliner. The web search results confirm the involvement of the Red Cross Society of China in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the Chinese Red Cross troops have changed into winter clothes and set off for the Russian-Ukrainian front to aid Russia in rescuing its occupied territories. The evidence also shows that Chinese nationals were captured fighting for Russia in Ukraine and that Chinese troops marched with Russian forces in Moscow's Victory Day parade.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported, but the specific details about the troops' attire and mission are not confirmed by the evidence.

Insufficient information is available to verify the claim's veracity.

With most avenues for Western partnership indefinitely closed and Russian economic dependency on China growing rapidly, Putin’s talk of “economic sovereignty” is starting to sound very hollow, writes Diane Francis.

Image: Chinese President Xi Jinping walks past honour guards and members of a military band during a welcoming ceremony upon his arrival at an airport in Moscow, Russia, on March 20, 2023. This raises the possibility that the PRC, via third parties, could provide or already provides Russia with more semiconductors than is evident from just Russia-China trade data. 

#### **Don’t give Beijing a pass** 

There is some evidence that Beijing is toeing the line on lethal aid without fully crossing it, as a _New York Times_ [investigation](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/21/business/russia-china-drones-ukraine-war.html)
 found that nearly seventy Chinese exporters sold twenty-six brands of drones to Russia since the invasion. As PRC leader [Xi Jinping told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://www.barrons.com/news/xi-tells-zelensky-china-has-always-stood-on-the-side-of-peace-state-media-64a8cdb8)
 in a recent call, according to state media, “China has always stood on the side of peace.” 

Whether or not the PRC crosses the threshold of providing weapons and munitions, often termed “lethal aid,” has become the primary measure of its support for Russia’s war—and the Western rhetoric around this threshold has hardened to the point of becoming a red line. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken then testified before Congress that “[we have not seen them cross that line](https://www.reuters.com/world/china-watching-worlds-response-war-ukraine-blinken-2023-03-22/)
.”  

In any event, this focus on lethal aid has come to mean that the vital support the PRC is already providing to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war effort, directly and indirectly, is receiving far less attention. While Beijing may continue to stop just short of providing direct lethal aid to Moscow—and it is preferable that Beijing does not cross this line—policymakers in the United States, NATO, and other like-minded countries that are concerned about Russian aggression against Ukraine should neither overlook nor accept the considerable assistance the PRC is _already providing_ Putin.  

Drawing the line at lethal aid essentially gives the PRC a pass for enabling Putin’s continued war of aggression against Ukraine. ##### Share

!China’s support may not be ‘lethal aid,’ but it’s vital to Russia’s aggression in Ukraine <image:13327>

It’s the conventional wisdom in Washington and in most European capitals: China is only providing limited support to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In recent weeks, NATO Secretary General [Jens Stoltenberg](https://www.reuters.com/article/nato-stoltenberg-russia-china/natos-stoltenberg-warns-china-against-delivering-arms-to-russia-idUKP6N35G001)
 and US National Security Adviser [Jake Sullivan](https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-02-27-23/h_6cb0fa87bacceab3a275e8999d217d40)
 specifically warned the PRC against providing lethal aid. However, it benefits Beijing and Moscow for Washington and its allies to focus so intensely on that red line that they fail to stem—or to even fully catalog and condemn—the other support that the PRC provides. 

Beijing’s direct provision of equipment and materials critical for military uses, such as transport vehicles and semiconductors, enables Russian military forces to sustain their offensive. Since trucking shortages [often produce inflation](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/09/us/politics/trucker-shortage-supply-chain.html)
, Chinese shipments of super-heavy trucks also helped to keep domestic prices under control, helping sustain Russia’s war economy. 

#### **Semiconductors play a critical role** 

Semiconductors are essential to manufacturing modern military systems, including replacements for the [limited stocks of Russian missiles remaining](https://dsm.forecastinternational.com/wordpress/2023/01/25/russia-denies-it-is-running-out-of-missiles/)
 for attacks on Ukrainian targets. The PRC is undermining the effectiveness of these [sanctions](https://www.state.gov/the-impact-of-sanctions-and-export-controls-on-the-russian-federation/)
 by directly and indirectly [supplying semiconductors,](https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-aids-russias-war-in-ukraine-trade-data-shows-11675466360)
 which removes a key constraint on Russia’s ability to build more missiles."

The Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA) shows an image of a vehicle with a Red Cross symbol (<image:13318>

## Elaboration
The new evidence provides additional context. The web search indicates that China's Red Cross has offered humanitarian aid to Ukraine, but China has not condemned Russia's actions and has increased trade with Russia. The image search shows a vehicle with a Red Cross symbol.

The claim is still not fully supported. While the Red Cross Society of China is involved, the evidence does not confirm that Chinese Red Cross troops have changed into winter clothes and set off for the Russian-Ukrainian front to aid Russia in rescuing its occupied territories. The evidence suggests a more nuanced situation, with China providing humanitarian aid to Ukraine while maintaining a close relationship with Russia.

## Claim
Claim: "<image:6> This image shows the Chinese Communist Party's Red Cross troops in Russia who have changed into winter clothes and set off for the Russian-Ukrainian front to aid Russia in rescuing its occupied territories."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:6>)
web_search("Chinese Red Cross troops Russia Ukraine")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The reverse image search found the image on Wikipedia ([Airliner - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airliner)) and Merriam-Webster ([AIRLINER Definition & Meaning - Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/airliner)). The Wikipedia article discusses airliners, while the Merriam-Webster entry defines the word "airliner". The Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum ([The Evolution of the Commercial Airliner](https://airandspace.si.edu/explore/stories/evolution-commercial-airliner)) also features the image and discusses the evolution of commercial airliners. <image:6>


### Evidence from `web_search`
CNN published an article on April 16, 2025, discussing the capture of Chinese nationals fighting for Russia in Ukraine, including an image of a captured Chinese national (<image:6>). The Guardian reported on May 9, 2025, that Chinese troops marched with Russian forces in Moscow's Victory Day parade (<image:3184>, <image:3185>, <image:3188>). The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and the International Committee of the Red Cross published a report on the Red Cross Red Crescent Movement's response to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, mentioning the involvement of the Russian Red Cross Society and the Red Cross Society of China.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the claim is partially accurate. The image is of an airliner. The web search results confirm the involvement of the Red Cross Society of China in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the Chinese Red Cross troops have changed into winter clothes and set off for the Russian-Ukrainian front to aid Russia in rescuing its occupied territories. The evidence also shows that Chinese nationals were captured fighting for Russia in Ukraine and that Chinese troops marched with Russian forces in Moscow's Victory Day parade.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported, but the specific details about the troops' attire and mission are not confirmed by the evidence.

Insufficient information is available to verify the claim's veracity.

Content: "Military analysts estimate two-thirds of the 1,000 sq km gained at the outset have since been lost.

Any hopes that Ukraine would be able to trade Kursk territory for some of its own have significantly diminished.

Last week, President Volodymyr Zelensky said he believed the Kursk operation had "accomplished its task" by forcing Russia to pull troops from the east and relieve pressure on Pokrovsk.

But it is not yet clear at what cost.

A Ukrainian soldier comforts a comrade during fighting in Kursk

Ukrainian soldiers fighting in Russia's Kursk region have described scenes "like a horror movie" as they retreated from the front lines.

The BBC has received extensive accounts from Ukrainian troops, who recount a "catastrophic" withdrawal in the face of heavy fire, and columns of military equipment destroyed and constant attacks from swarms of Russian drones.

The soldiers, who spoke over social media, were given aliases to protect their identity. <image:3100>!Map showing the region of Sudzha in August 2024, controlled by Ukraine and on 16 March 2025, under Russian control <image:3103>

Volodymyr said it was possible to travel on that road relatively safely a month ago. But this again came as a surprise to our command."

At the time of writing, just before Russia retook Sudzha, Volodymyr said Ukrainian forces were being pressed from three sides.

Maksym: Vehicle wrecks litter the roads
---------------------------------------

By 11 March, Ukrainian forces were battling to prevent the road being cut, according to Telegram messages from "Maksym".

"A few days ago, we received an order to leave the defence lines in an organised retreat," he said, adding that Russia had amassed a significant force to retake the town, "including large numbers of North Korean soldiers".

Military experts estimate Russia had amassed a force of up to 70,000 troops to retake Kursk – including about 12,000 North Koreans.

Russia had also sent its best drone units to the front and was using kamikaze and first-person-view (FPV) variants to "take fire control of the main logistics routes".

They included drones linked to operators by fibre-optic wires - which are impossible to jam with electronic counter-measures.

Maksym said as a result "the enemy managed to destroy dozens of units of equipment", and that wrecks had "created congestion on supply routes".

! But this is how five Ukrainian soldiers described to us what had happened.

Volodymyr: 'Drones around the clock'
------------------------------------

On 9 March, "Volodymyr" sent a Telegram post to the BBC saying he was still in Sudzha, where there was "panic and collapse of the front".

Ukrainian troops "are trying to leave - columns of troops and equipment. It is impossible to leave during the day."

Movement of men, logistics and equipment had been reliant on one major route between Sudzha and Ukraine's Sumy region.

Ukrainian forces travel towards the Kursk region on a supply route in Sumy last August. The situation, he said, had turned from "difficult and critical to catastrophic".

In a message on 14 March, Dmytro added: "Everything is finished in the Kursk region... <image:3100>!Getty A damaged statue of Lenin stands in Sudzha after fighting in August <image:3109>Getty

What now for Ukraine's offensive?
---------------------------------

Ukraine's top general, Oleksandr Syrskyi, insists that Ukrainian forces have pulled back to "more favourable positions", remain in Kursk, and would do so "for as long as it is expedient and necessary".

He said Russia had suffered more than 50,000 losses during the operation - including those killed, injured or captured.

However, the situation now is very different to last August."

President Vladimir Putin visited Russia's Kursk region on Wednesday.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukrainian troops have not been encircled by Russian forces in [Kursk](https://cnn.com/2025/03/13/europe/russia-claim-recaptured-sudzha-intl)
 region, accusing Russian leader Vladimir Putin of “lying” about the situation on the ground.

Ukraine launched its shock incursion into Kursk in August, swiftly capturing territory in what was the first ground invasion of Russia by a foreign power since World War II. Witkoff said the two are likely to speak again this week, expressing optimism that a ceasefire deal can be reached within weeks.

But Ukrainian officials and independent analysts have disputed Putin and Trump’s claims about Russia surrounding Ukrainian troops in Kursk.

The Institute for the Study of War, a US-based conflict monitor, said Friday that it has “observed no geolocated evidence to indicate that Russian forces have encircled a significant number of Ukrainian forces” in Kursk or anywhere else along the frontline in Ukraine.

Ukraine’s military said that Russia was lying to shape perception of events on the ground.

“Reports of the alleged ‘encirclement’ of Ukrainian units by the enemy in the Kursk region are false and fabricated by the Russians for political manipulation and to exert pressure on Ukraine and its partners,” the military said.

“There is no threat of encirclement of our units,” it said, adding that its units in Kursk have “successfully regrouped” after Russia’s offensives and “withdrawn to more advantageous defensive positions.”

In an update Saturday, Zelensky said he had been briefed by Ukraine’s commander in chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi, and also stressed that Ukraine’s troops have not been encircled.

“The units are carrying out their tasks exactly as required” and are continuing to repel Russian and North Korean troops, Zelensky said.

Zelensky did, however, say Kyiv was aware of a buildup of Russian troops on Ukraine’s eastern border, which he said “indicates an intention to attack” the Sumy region that borders Kursk. The campaign aimed to divert Moscow’s resources from the front lines in the east, and to capture land that could potentially be swapped for Russian-occupied Ukrainian territory.

Although Kyiv is now on the back foot in Kursk, Zelensky and military analysts have questioned Putin’s claims – echoed by US President Donald Trump – that Russian forces have surrounded Ukraine’s soldiers.

Putin claimed on Thursday that Russian forces had “isolated” Ukraine’s troops in Kursk and that it was “impossible” for them to escape even in small groups of two or three soldiers.

“There will only be two options: surrender or die,” Putin said.

A day later, Trump appeared to amplify Putin’s claims after what he called a “very good and productive” discussion with the Russian president.

“At this very moment, thousands of Ukrainian troops are completely surrounded by the Russian military, and in a very bad and vulnerable position,” Trump said in a post on TruthSocial on Friday, claiming he had asked Putin to spare their lives to avert “a horrible massacre, one not seen since World War II.”

Although the US president did not refer specifically to Kursk, Putin later told Russia’s security council that he had “noted” Trump’s appeal to save Ukrainian lives in the region.

In an interview Sunday with CNN’s Jake Tapper, Trump’s foreign envoy Steve Witkoff said that Putin “accepts the philosophy of President Trump” and that both leaders want to see an end to the war. The video shows residential homes lying in ruins, roads scattered with debris and the bodies of soldiers killed in combat.

In an update on Sunday, the ministry said it was continuing to “defeat” Ukrainian formations in Kursk, but made no mention of an encirclement.

Ukraine’s General Staff said Sunday there had been 19 clashes with Russian troops over the past day in the region, and that Moscow had launched 34 air strikes and 63 guided bombs.

Ad Feedback This week, Moscow said that Russian forces had recaptured Sudzha, the largest town once occupied by Ukraine, further weakening Kyiv’s primary bargaining chip in potential negotiations with Russia.

On Saturday, Russia’s Defense Ministry posted a video from Sudzha, geolocated by CNN, showing the city after it was “liberated” by Russian troops. The Sumy military administration reported heavy shelling overnight into Sunday, targeting towns and villages close to the border.

Ceasefire ‘distraction’
-----------------------

Although Russian military bloggers have said that Ukraine is losing territory in Kursk, some also [disputed the reports](https://t.me/milinfolive/143862)
 that Moscow has “encircled” Kyiv’s forces.

The ISW suggested that Putin was making dubious claims about Ukrainian troops in Kursk region in order to “distract” from his prevarication over the US-backed ceasefire proposal.

Kyiv agreed to the proposal during talks with US officials in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, while Putin gave a more ambiguous response, first saying “we agree with the proposal” before claiming the deal “wasn’t complete.”

“Putin is attempting to present himself as a reasonable and merciful leader whom President Trump can engage with and to generate a new narrative to distract from” Russia’s refusal to agree to the ceasefire proposal, the ISW wrote.

Zelensky denies troops surrounded in Kursk as Russia retakes villages
=====================================================================

Kyiv (Ukraine) (AFP) – Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky denied Saturday his troops were encircled in Russia's Kursk region, where Moscow has regained swathes of land this week, as Russia said it took back two more villages in the border region.

 ![Zelensky denies troops surrounded in Kursk as Russia retakes villages](https://s.france24.com/media/display/99f8a93a-e6c1-11ee-9116-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/img-default-F24.jpg)

US leader Donald Trump had a day earlier asked Russia's Vladimir Putin on social media to spare the lives of Ukrainian troops that he said were "completely surrounded" by the Russian army.

Moscow has pushed this week to retake a large part of the land that Ukraine originally captured in its western Kursk region last summer.

Zelensky has acknowledged that the situation in the Kursk area is "very difficult" for Ukraine, but contradicted Trump's comments.

"There is no encirclement of out troops," he said on social media, adding that: "Our troops continue to hold back Russian and North Korean groupings in the Kursk region."

Kyiv had hoped to use the Russian territories as a bargaining chip in any negotiations to end the more than three-year conflict.

The UK on Saturday hosted a virtual summit on how to protect any ceasefire in Ukraine, but Zelensky warned that Moscow was intent on "prolonging the war" and "ignoring diplomacy."

He also accused Moscow of amassing troops on the border with "an intention to attack our Sumy region" -- attacked by Moscow at the start of its 2022 invasion but since spared the worst of the fighting seen in other eastern regions.

Putin had this week not committed to an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine proposed by the US, instead putting forward conditions and raising "serious questions" about the idea.

The Kremlin has hailed its troops ousting Ukrainian forces from swathes of the Kursk region, with Moscow on Saturday releasing images of a destroyed centre in Sudzha -- the main town occupied by Ukrainian forces for months.

The Russian defence ministry said troops took control over the villages of Zaoleshenka and Rubanshchina -- north and west of Sudzha.

\- Russia evacuates civilians -

Sudzha was home to around 6,000 people before fighting began and Ukraine had set up a military administration there after its shock August 2024 incursion.

The Russian defence ministry's footage showed heavily destroyed houses and shops, with rubble and broken glass on the streets, and some Russian flags flying.

The acting governor of the Kursk region, Alexander Khinstein, said Russia had evacuated 275 civilians from areas it had regained since Wednesday.

Khinstein said "174 of the residents are now in temporary accommodation" and that the "work of evacuating our residents is continuing."

The Kremlin has hailed the Kursk operations as a major success.

Responding to Trump's call to spare Ukrainian troops in Kursk region, Putin said Friday:

"If they lay down their arms and surrender, they will be guaranteed life and dignified treatment."

Russia's defence ministry also said that military engineers were working to clear the areas that were held by Ukraine.

Russia oil depot fire
---------------------

Russia had also deployed almost 200 firefighters to help put out a fire at an oil depot caused by a Ukraine drone strike in the southern Krasnodar region, authorities said.

The governor of the Krasnodar region Veniamin Kondratyev said in the early hours of Saturday that a petrol reserve station in the Black Sea city of Tuapse was "attacked by the Kyiv regime."

Elsewhere on the front, Zelensky claimed the situation around the eastern city of Pokrovsk -- which Russian troops have tried to capture for months -- had "stabilised."

Ukrainian officials also said the number of wounded from a Russian strike a day earlier on Zelensky's hometown Kryvy Rig rose to 14.

Moscow has targeted the central city throughout its invasion and Kyiv said Friday it struck a residential area of Kryvy Rig, destroying large apartment buildings.

Ukrainian prosecutors said the wounded children were a two-year-old and a 15-year-old.

The evidence confirms that Ukrainian forces controlled Sudzha in the Kursk region in August 2024, but the area was under Russian control by March 2025. The provided search results do not confirm that Zelensky visited Sudzha in August 2024 or met with representatives there.

```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The BBC published an article discussing the situation in the Kursk region, including Sudzha, in August 2024, stating that Ukrainian forces took control of Sudzha in August 2024, but by March 16, 2025, the area was under Russian control. The article includes accounts from Ukrainian soldiers who described the withdrawal from the front lines. ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0q198zyppqo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0q198zyppqo))

CNN and France 24 reported on the situation in the Kursk region, with CNN mentioning that President Zelensky denied that Ukrainian troops were encircled by Russian forces, and France 24 stating that Zelensky denied that his troops were encircled in the Kursk region and that Russia has retaken villages in the region, including Sudzha. ([https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/15/europe/zelensky-putin-kursk-encircle-russia-ukraine-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/15/europe/zelensky-putin-kursk-encircle-russia-ukraine-intl), [https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250315-zelensky-denies-troops-surrounded-in-kursk-as-russia-retakes-villages](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250315-zelensky-denies-troops-surrounded-in-kursk-as-russia-retakes-villages)).

The BBC article includes images <image:3103>, <image:3101>, <image:3105>, <image:3109>. The CNN article includes an image <image:1>. The France 24 article includes an image <image:i>.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Ukrainian forces took control of Sudzha in the Kursk region in August 2024. However, by March 16, 2025, the area was under Russian control. The BBC article includes images related to the events in the Kursk region. The claim states that the image shows Zelensky arriving in August 2024 in Sudzha, which aligns with the information about the Ukrainian control of the area at that time.

The evidence does not explicitly mention Zelensky's visit to Sudzha in August 2024. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified.

The claim also mentions Zelensky meeting with representatives of the people there. The evidence does not provide any information about this meeting.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Ukrainian forces took control of Sudzha in the Kursk region in August 2024. However, by March 16, 2025, the area was under Russian control. The BBC article includes images related to the events in the Kursk region. The claim states that the image shows Zelensky arriving in August 2024 in Sudzha, which aligns with the information about the Ukrainian control of the area at that time.

The evidence does not explicitly mention Zelensky's visit to Sudzha in August 2024. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified.

The claim also mentions Zelensky meeting with representatives of the people there. The evidence does not provide any information about this meeting.

    Russian rockets are devastating large areas of eastern Ukraine
    
    Russia is reported to have fired its latest multiple-rocket system against Ukrainian targets in the Kharkiv area – a weapon described as a giant flamethrower.
    
    That is what a Russian security official told the state-run Tass news agency. It has not been confirmed officially.
    
    The TOS-2 Tosochka is a thermobaric fuel-air weapon: it creates massive explosions by igniting gas clouds on impact, depriving anyone in the area of oxygen.
    
    Ukraine has pushed Russian forces back from the outskirts of Kharkiv, the second city, which was visited by President Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday.
    
    Earlier Russia confirmed that it was using TOS-1 Solntsepyok (“Blazing Sun”) rockets against targets in the Donbas, where Ukrainian forces are under constant, intense bombardment.
    
    TOS-1 is also thermobaric, with a range of up to 10km (six miles). The TOS-2’s manufacturer Rostec says TOS-2 has a longer range, better automatic targeting and more versatility. TOS-2 rockets are carried on an armoured truck, not a tank chassis.

    It was a rare trip for President Zelensky outside Kyiv. He visited troops on the frontline near Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second city, handed out awards and gifts, and thanked soldiers for their service.
    
    “You’re risking your life for all of us and our state,” he said. “Thank you for defending Ukraine’s independence. Take care!”
    
    The visit was a demonstration of the country’s success in pushing Russian forces back from the city. And was probably intended to boost morale as Ukraine tries to contain a massive Russian offensive in the Donbas area further east.
    
    An onslaught that is causing enormous suffering and destruction.
    
    Hours after the president left, loud explosions were reported in Kharkiv. A message that the threat posed by the invading forces there may have subsided, but it’s not entirely gone.

    Verdi's Rigoletto is being performed at Kyiv's Opera House
    
    Ukraine’s capital is 1,540 years old this weekend, and you’d be forgiven for assuming Kyiv wasn’t in the mood to celebrate.
    
    After all, it’s just over three months ago that the city found itself surrounded by Russian forces, with some predicting it would fall within 72 hours.
    
    At the time, I remember standing outside the Opera House, where the only gathering of people was outside a nearby pharmacy - scared and angry.
    
    Today it's a different scene. There is a sea of smiling faces, colourful outfits and cheerful chatter as people walk in to watch a performance of Verdi's Rigoletto. Shows returned last week; and you can’t help but feel the joy of those lucky enough to get a ticket. Tickets are limited to 300, the capacity of the theatre's bomb shelter.
    
    !Kyiv <image:1637>
    
    “Life really goes on and we do not stop,” says Pavlo, one of the soldiers in uniform, in passing. “We hope for the best and believe everything is going to be alright”.
    
    Backstage one of the lead singers, Olga Fomichova, sits illuminated by her make up mirror. “I can see our audience needs us, from the sold-out tickets, but it won’t be the same” she admits.
    
    “I don’t have anger or defiance, only the desire to be heard, that the Ukrainians are a cultural and educated nation which deserves world-wide respect and attention.”
    
    For several of its 1,540 years, other rulers and empires have tried to take Kyiv by force. Some have been more successful than others, but few predicted such attempts would be made in 2022.

    !Volodymyr Zelensky visits Kharkiv <image:1640>Image source, Ukraine President's Office
    
    Volodymyr Zelensky has not turned out to be the president many predicted. The former comedian, the voice of Ukrainian Paddington Bear, was once mocked as a lightweight.
    
    Now, he is compared to Winston Churchill.
    
    His steadfastness in the face of overwhelming Russian force is credited by many as being a crucial factor in his country’s remarkable performance in the beginning of this war.
    
    His defiant videos from the streets of the capital, Kyiv, were a metaphorical middle finger to Russia and its president.
    
    While President Zelensky would appear with his colleagues, arms around their shoulders, Vladimir Putin was pictured at one end of an almost comedically long table, his officials barely in shouting distance.
    
    As effective as they were, however, those appearances were all in the capital. Today’s visit to Kharkiv is the first time he has left the Kyiv region since the start of Russia’s invasion.
    
    He met the troops that have not just defended Kharkiv, but repelled the Russians, almost pushing them back to the international border.
    
    The fact that he was able to visit shows just how much the tide has turned in Ukraine’s second city. A few weeks ago, this morale boosting visit would never have been possible.
    
    But, do not be mistaken, Kharkiv is only safe for now. Elsewhere, Ukraine very much appears on the back foot, withering Russian artillery barrages forcing them to retreat in the Donbas.
    
    With its charismatic president, Ukraine has very much won the informational war. Unfortunately for them, that is not where this conflict will ultimately be decided.

    Stopping Russia is the common mission of all civilised countries, Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhaylo Podolyak has said.
    
    "'Why does the world pay more attention to Ukraine than to Africa or the East?' - such a narrative is promoted by Russian agents," he wrote in a tweet.
    
    The Ukraine war is not a local conflict - it is the question of what the world will be like tomorrow, he added.
    
    Allowing Russia to win would "open Pandora's box and push humanity into the dark ages."
    
    Podolyak went on to say: "Any autocrat would be able to provoke territorial conflicts, seize countries and exterminate nations.
    
    "Stopping Russia is a mission of all civilized countries. There's time, but we should hurry up."

7.  !Kherson pictured on 20 May <image:1643>Image source, Getty Images
    
    Moscow-imposed authorities in the southern city of Kherson say nearby fighting could affect the timing of its formal bid to join Russia.
    
    Russian forces occupied Kherson in early March - one week after the invasion of Ukraine began. It was the first major city to fall.
    
    Kirill Stremousov, deputy-head of [Kherson's Moscow-installed administration](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-61338617)
    , says the process might involve a referendum, backtracking on previous comments suggesting none was needed.
    
    According to Reuters news agency, he says: "We'll announce later when some kind of vote or plebiscite is planned, but it won’t be today and it won’t be tomorrow because our first task is to restore order in the Kherson region."
    
    Russia has said that the fate of the Kherson region is for local residents to decide.
    
    But the UK Ministry of Defence said, [in an intelligence update in April, external](https://twitter.com/DefenceHQ/status/1518335593482268672)
    , a referendum would be a way for Russia to justify its occupation of Ukraine.
    
    And President Zelensky has said it fits in with Russia's plans of breaking Ukraine apart by creating "pseudo-republics" throughout the country.
    
    He has advised people [not to give the Russian authorities any personal data](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-61188943)
    , such as passport numbers, as they might be used to falsify votes.

8.  More now on President Zelensky's rare trip outside of the capital Kyiv.
    
    He visited the frontline in the Kharkiv region where he spoke with troops and presented gifts.
    
    It comes as intense fighting continues in the region as troops attempt to regain control of the area from the Russians.
    
    Here are some more pictures of his visit.

    Mr Zelensky visited front line positions in the Kharkiv region, it said.
    
    "I want to thank each of you for your service. You risk your life for all of us and our state," the president told troops.
    
    The north-easten city has seen some of the worst fighting since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine on 24 February.

10.  Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said last week's talks with Finnish and Swedish delegations were not at the "expected level" and Ankara cannot approve their applications to join the Nato military alliance.
    
    "For as long as Tayyip Erdogan is the head of the Republic of Turkey, we definitely cannot say 'yes' to countries which support terrorism entering Nato," the president said.
    
    Without the support of all Nato members, Sweden and Finland cannot join the military alliance.
    
    Both Nordic countries deny supporting Kurdish militants. But they have joined other EU countries in imposing a weapons embargo on Turkey following its operations against Kurdish groups in Syria.

12.  As we reported earlier, Russia's defence ministry says its missiles have destroyed a large arsenal of Ukrainian army weapons in Kryvyi Rih - the home city of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
    
    Now we can bring you more details. Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov claims in the last 24 hours more than 300 "nationalists" \[Ukrainian soldiers\] have been killed.
    
    He also claims a number of other Ukrainian military targets were hit in the offensive, including a Russian defence systems shooting down a Ukrainian SU-25 fighter jet in Dnipro.
    
    He says: "In total, as a result of Russian air strikes, more than 300 nationalists and up to 50 units of military and special equipment of the armed forces of Ukraine were destroyed."

13.  The governor of the Luhansk region has accused Russia of systematically destroying the city of Severodonetsk and its residents.
    
    Serhiy Haidai said the attacks were relentless as fierce fighting rages in the area.
    
    Severodonetsk is the easternmost place in the Donbas region still held by Ukraine and it is currently a key target for Russian forces.
    
    The Luhansk governor said more civilians in the city had been killed in the latest attacks and buildings had been destroyed, including apartment blocks and a cinema.
    
    But he said Russian troops trying to capture a vital road out had been driven back.
    
    Earlier Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said the situation remained difficult in the Donbas and Kharkiv regions where he said Russia was trying to "squeeze out some result for itself".

    [What we heard from Russia's UK ambassador Andrei Kelin](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-61618902)
    , we’ve been hearing for years from Russian officials whenever their county is accused of anything.
    
    All accusations are rebuffed, all evidence of Russian complicity is dismissed.
    
    What you end up with is this parallel reality in which CCTV footage of Russian soldiers shooting dead unarmed Ukrainian civilians is dismissed as a joke or a computer game.
    
    Where the [horrors of Bucha](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/60981238)
     are dismissed as a fabrication, and where the levelling of residential areas of Mariupol is brushed aside as either collateral damage or blamed on Ukrainian soldiers.
    
    In other words, none of this is ever Russia’s fault, everyone is against Russia, everyone is blaming Russia, everyone is accusing Russia and it claims it is the innocent party.
    
    This is the Kremlin narrative which we’ve heard many times before. We heard it after the Salisbury poisonings, we heard it after the attempted assassination of the Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny and we’re hearing it again now.

16.  !The BBC's Clive Myrie with Russian ambassador to the UK Andrei Kelin <image:1653>
    
    As we've previously reported, Russia's ambassador to the UK has told the BBC he does not believe his country will use tactical nuclear weapons in the war against Ukraine.
    
    He has also criticised the UK's Foreign Secretary Liz Truss for her tough stance on Russia. Britain has [imposed a number of sanctions on Russian individuals and businesses](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60125659)
    , as well as sending weapons to Ukraine.
    
    Ambassador Andrei Kelin told the BBC's Clive Myrie: "She's neither a professional military man or she's not for a long time at this position.
    
    "But she's very belligerent...
    
    "On the position that UK would like to supply more and more arms, \[but\] not to think about the future of Ukraine or of Europe...
    
    "But just to instigate conflict. Why this? What's the motivation for that?
    
    "To make Russia more feeble?"
    
    The ambassador added that Russia's economy has not "toppled down" despite the restrictions and asked what the benefit of sanctions was for the UK, which has [seen inflation hit a 40-year high](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-61483175)
    , partly driven by the Ukraine war.
    
    After sanctions were imposed on Russia, the rouble fell 22% in value pushing up the price of imported goods, before it recovered.
    
    More than 1,000 international companies have also suspended trading in Russia or withdrawn altogether - including McDonalds, Coca-Cola and Starbucks.

    The question about negotiating in a war depends on the battlefield and on the state of mind of the parties contesting it.
    
    It has to get to a point where either side is suffering so much they are prepared to go into negotiations and give some ground, or that one side feels it has achieved enough and it is prepared to bank those gains.
    
    But at the moment I think both the Russians and Ukrainians have unfinished agendas.
    
    The Ukrainians want the Russians out. The Russians want to move forward and make their points, and deliver a victory.
    
    So I think politically there is no chance right now for a negotiation that means anything other than people getting together and talking in a room.

18.  Russia has rejected accusations that its invasion of Ukraine has created serious threats to global food security, instead blaming Western sanctions.
    
    The West has accused the Russian military of holding food supplies hostage for millions around the world.
    
    The war in Ukraine has blocked the country's main ports on the Black sea, severely impacting food supply chains around the world. Ukraine is a major exporter of wheat, but now millions of tonnes of grain are stuck - impacting the countries that can least afford it.
    
    "The attempts of the West to attribute all troubles to the special military operation and accuse Russia of blocking foreign ships in the ports of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov are absolutely groundless," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said.
    
    "The main catalyst for the existing negative trends was the anti-Russian sanctions of the West, which led to a rupture of ties in the field of global logistics and transport infrastructure," she said.
    
    The hike in prices for agricultural products started in 2020 "and is by no means a result of the special military operation" in Ukraine she claimed, before also blaming Covid.
    
    The pandemic "has severely disrupted value chains and significantly increased the cost of food transportation services", she added.

    The war is especially raging in the east of Ukraine in the Donbas region.
    
    Russian forces have launched a number of assaults around the city of Severodonetsk, which is increasingly finding itself surrounded.
    
    Military experts think there is not much for Russia to gain economically or militarily by taking the city other than to declare some kind of early victory in the war, as it remains the last major city not in Russian control in the region of Luhansk.
    
    What isn't clear is whether Russian President Vladimir Putin, should the Donbas region fall, will continue to try and take more of Ukraine.
    
    It's been another night where we've seen more missile attacks, which continually raise questions over what happens next.

20.  Russia’s ambassador to the UK has told the BBC he does not believe his country will use tactical nuclear weapons in the war against Ukraine.
    
    Speaking to Clive Myrie, Andrei Kelin said such weapons would be used only if Russia’s existence was threatened.
    
    The ambassador also denied Russian forces were shelling civilians, and said allegations of war crimes in the town of Bucha were a "fabrication".
    
    Kelin's claims are contradicted by numerous [eyewitness accounts from residents](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-61003878)
    , who have told the BBC that Russian troops executed their loved ones.
    
    The full interview can be seen in the UK on the Sunday Morning programme, BBC One 9am.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:7> This image shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky arriving in August 2024 in the Sudzha of Kursk region, Russia, which had just been occupied by Ukrainian troops in the Kursk Offensive, and meeting with representatives of the people there."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The BBC published an article discussing the situation in the Kursk region, including Sudzha, in August 2024, stating that Ukrainian forces took control of Sudzha in August 2024, but by March 16, 2025, the area was under Russian control. The article includes accounts from Ukrainian soldiers who described the withdrawal from the front lines. ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0q198zyppqo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0q198zyppqo))

CNN and France 24 reported on the situation in the Kursk region, with CNN mentioning that President Zelensky denied that Ukrainian troops were encircled by Russian forces, and France 24 stating that Zelensky denied that his troops were encircled in the Kursk region and that Russia has retaken villages in the region, including Sudzha. ([https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/15/europe/zelensky-putin-kursk-encircle-russia-ukraine-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/15/europe/zelensky-putin-kursk-encircle-russia-ukraine-intl), [https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250315-zelensky-denies-troops-surrounded-in-kursk-as-russia-retakes-villages](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250315-zelensky-denies-troops-surrounded-in-kursk-as-russia-retakes-villages)).

The BBC article includes images <image:3103>, <image:3101>, <image:3105>, <image:3109>. The CNN article includes an image <image:1>. The France 24 article includes an image <image:i>.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Ukrainian forces took control of Sudzha in the Kursk region in August 2024. However, by March 16, 2025, the area was under Russian control. The BBC article includes images related to the events in the Kursk region. The claim states that the image shows Zelensky arriving in August 2024 in Sudzha, which aligns with the information about the Ukrainian control of the area at that time.

The evidence does not explicitly mention Zelensky's visit to Sudzha in August 2024. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified.

The claim also mentions Zelensky meeting with representatives of the people there. The evidence does not provide any information about this meeting.

Ukraine's president has made a rare trip outside the capital, Kiev, the presidential office says.

According to foreign media, Telegrafi reports, Zelensky visited the frontline positions in the Kharkiv region.

! <image:1660>

  

"I want to thank each of you for your service. You risk your life for all of us and our country", the president told the troops.

! <image:1661>

The northeastern city has seen some of the fiercest fighting since Russia launched its aggression in Ukraine on February 24.

! <image:1662>

His visit comes as Ukraine has begun receiving Harpoon anti-ship missiles from Denmark and others from the US.

Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov was quoted as saying that the supply of Harpoon missiles was the result of cooperation between several countries.

Ukraine has sought more sophisticated weapons, but so far most of the help has been in short-range systems, such as anti-tank weapons.

Meanwhile, the US is said to be considering a request from Ukraine to supply Kiev with heavier, longer-range weapons, but has yet to make a final decision. /**Telegraph**/

## Claim
Claim: "<image:7> This image shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky arriving in August 2024 in the Sudzha of Kursk region, Russia, which had just been occupied by Ukrainian troops in the Kursk Offensive, and meeting with representatives of the people there."

## Actions
```
web_search("Volodymyr Zelensky Sudzha Kursk region")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The BBC published an article discussing the situation in the Kursk region, including Sudzha, in August 2024, stating that Ukrainian forces took control of Sudzha in August 2024, but by March 16, 2025, the area was under Russian control. The article includes accounts from Ukrainian soldiers who described the withdrawal from the front lines. ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0q198zyppqo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0q198zyppqo))

CNN and France 24 reported on the situation in the Kursk region, with CNN mentioning that President Zelensky denied that Ukrainian troops were encircled by Russian forces, and France 24 stating that Zelensky denied that his troops were encircled in the Kursk region and that Russia has retaken villages in the region, including Sudzha. ([https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/15/europe/zelensky-putin-kursk-encircle-russia-ukraine-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/15/europe/zelensky-putin-kursk-encircle-russia-ukraine-intl), [https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250315-zelensky-denies-troops-surrounded-in-kursk-as-russia-retakes-villages](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250315-zelensky-denies-troops-surrounded-in-kursk-as-russia-retakes-villages)).

The BBC article includes images <image:3103>, <image:3101>, <image:3105>, <image:3109>. The CNN article includes an image <image:1>. The France 24 article includes an image <image:i>.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Ukrainian forces took control of Sudzha in the Kursk region in August 2024. However, by March 16, 2025, the area was under Russian control. The BBC article includes images related to the events in the Kursk region. The claim states that the image shows Zelensky arriving in August 2024 in Sudzha, which aligns with the information about the Ukrainian control of the area at that time.

The evidence does not explicitly mention Zelensky's visit to Sudzha in August 2024. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified.

The claim also mentions Zelensky meeting with representatives of the people there. The evidence does not provide any information about this meeting.


## Actions
```
image_search("Zelensky Sudzha Kursk August 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The Institute for the Study of War published a map showing the Ukrainian incursion into Kursk Oblast as of August 23, 2024, including Sudzha <image:13335>. CNN published an article on August 24, 2024, about the situation in the Kursk region <image:13336>. The New York Times published a map showing Ukrainian advances in the Kursk region, including Sudzha, in August 2024 <image:13337>.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Ukrainian forces advanced into the Kursk region, including Sudzha, in August 2024. However, the image search did not return any images of Zelensky in Sudzha during that time. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified. The evidence does not provide information about Zelensky meeting with representatives of the people.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The BBC published an article discussing the situation in the Kursk region, including Sudzha, in August 2024, stating that Ukrainian forces took control of Sudzha in August 2024, but by March 16, 2025, the area was under Russian control. The article includes accounts from Ukrainian soldiers who described the withdrawal from the front lines. ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0q198zyppqo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0q198zyppqo))

CNN and France 24 reported on the situation in the Kursk region, with CNN mentioning that President Zelensky denied that Ukrainian troops were encircled by Russian forces, and France 24 stating that Zelensky denied that his troops were encircled in the Kursk region and that Russia has retaken villages in the region, including Sudzha.

The evidence indicates that Ukrainian forces took control of Sudzha in the Kursk region in August 2024. However, by March 16, 2025, the area was under Russian control. The BBC article includes images related to the events in the Kursk region. The claim states that the image shows Zelensky arriving in August 2024 in Sudzha, which aligns with the information about the Ukrainian control of the area at that time.

The evidence does not explicitly mention Zelensky's visit to Sudzha in August 2024. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified.

The claim also mentions Zelensky meeting with representatives of the people there. The evidence does not provide any information about this meeting.

The body of a boy was found under the rubble of a building hit by a Russian strike in Kyiv's Schevchenkyvskyi district, bringing the death toll of the July 8 attack on the city to 27, the Interior Ministry said on July 9.

Among the dead are four children, the [Interior Ministry said](https://t.me/mvs_ukraine/39672)
. Another 117 people were injured in Kyiv and seven were rescued from buildings that had been damaged in the strike.

Emergency services are still working at three sites, the ministry said.

Schevchenkyvskyi district is the location of both a residential building hit in Russia's strike and the [Okhmatdyt hospital](https://kyivindependent.com/russian-missile-attack-hits-okhmatdyt-children-hospital-casualties-reported/)
, Ukraine's largest children's medical center, which Russia [directly targeted](https://kyivindependent.com/russian-missile-struck-childrens-hospital-in-kyiv-following-programmed-route-source-says/)

The Russian military struck the children's [hospital](https://kyivindependent.com/who-data-suggest-more-ukrainians-could-die-in-medical-site-attacks-in-2024/)
 with a Kh-101 cruise missile, according to the preliminary data obtained by the [**State Security Service**](https://t.me/SBUkr/12339)
 (SBU), killing at least two people and injuring at least 50.

Russia launched [**another attack**](https://kyivindependent.com/latest-russian-attack-on-kyiv-hits-maternity-hospital-4-killed/)

Russian Federation’s Attack on Ukrainian Children’s Hospital ‘Not Only a War Crime’ but ‘Far Beyond the Limits of Humanity’, Medical Director Tells Security Council
====================================================================================================================================================================

‘There Has Been No Respite for Civilians in Ukraine’, Says Humanitarian Official

Amid a wave of the Russian Federation’s deadly missile attacks, targeting multiple cities across Ukraine on 8 July — including a strike that hit the Okhmatdyt children’s hospital in Kyiv — the United Nations top humanitarian official warned against a deeply concerning pattern of systematic attacks harming health-care and other civilian infrastructure.

“There has been no respite for civilians in Ukraine”, said Joyce Msuya, Acting Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, adding that she was “shocked by yesterday’s deadly missile strikes on Kyiv, Kryvi Rih, Pokrovsk, Dnipro and other urban centres”.  In Kyiv, the intensive care, surgical and oncology wards of Ukraine’s largest children’s hospital were severely damaged, and its toxicology department — where children receive dialysis — was destroyed.  “Russia started this war and Russia can end it at any time”, she underscored, reaffirming support for Ukraine.

The representative of the United Kingdom said that, in its repeated attacks against Ukraine since 23 February 2022, the Russian Federation has killed, maimed and abducted Ukrainian children.  Further, on 8 July, it attacked a children’s hospital. “This is cowardly depravity, and this must stop”, she underscored, stating that the intentional direction of attacks against civilian populations and objects constitutes a war crime. Stressing that Moscow’s conduct “is a disgrace to the Security Council and, especially, to the President’s seat”, she urged those present to jointly condemn the Russian Federation’s actions. For its part, the United Kingdom and its partners “will continue to ensure Ukraine is able to defend itself from these barbaric acts of violence” and — at the ongoing summit of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) — “will demonstrate our resolve to support Ukraine for as long as it takes”.  Moscow must end its aggression against Ukraine and withdraw its forces.  “And stop killing Ukrainian children”, she added.

The representative of Japan lamented that the Council met “once again to confront the grim reality” caused by the Russian Federation’s escalating attacks across Ukraine, including a barrage of missiles that caused serious damage and many casualties at a pediatric hospital in Kyiv.  She wished that the children there would get prompt and appropriate care.  The Office for the High Commissioner of Human Rights (OHCHR) is verifying figures while rescue workers, hospital staff and volunteers continue to clear rubble in search of people trapped under debris. Health officials report that what remains of the children’s hospital is without electricity, preventing the use of ventilators and other urgent care.  UN Human Rights staff has helped move child patients to other facilities while providing psychosocial support and assisting with other urgent needs. She also highlighted “a massive outpouring of solidarity” from local residents, who rushed to the scene to help remove rubble and provide blankets, water and food for patients and medical staff. Furthermore, at least seven civilians were killed at the ISIDA medical centre in Kyiv — one of Ukraine’s largest women’s health and family planning centres — when debris from an intercepted missile hit the facility.

“Intentionally directing attacks against a protected hospital is a war crime, and perpetrators must be held to account”, she asserted, adding that these incidents are part of a deeply concerning pattern of systematic attacks harming health care and other civilian infrastructure across Ukraine. Attacks have intensified since the spring of 2024.  The World Health Organization (WHO) has verified 1,878 attacks affecting health-care facilities, personnel, transport, supplies and patients since February 2022.  Multilateral efforts that preserve diplomatic frameworks are the best way to achieve concrete solutions, he said.

The representative of Malta, noting that the Okhmatdyt National Children’s Specialized Hospital is a beneficiary of the technical cooperation programme run by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said that the missile attack against it “not only endangers lives, but also constitutes a violation of IAEA’s core principles and values”.  Health and educational facilities “must always be protected” to ensure uninterrupted delivery of their services to all people in Ukraine, she stressed, calling for the immediate cessation of all attacks against hospitals, residential buildings and critical infrastructure in Ukraine and on all parties to adhere to their obligations under international law.  The attacks on 8 July took place amidst Moscow’s new military offensive in the Kharkiv region, but attacks throughout 2024 have endangered the lives of thousands of children, health-care workers and civilians. Against that backdrop, she stressed: “The perpetrators of these actions must be held accountable for the damage done.”

The representative of Mozambique said that civilian deaths, both intentional and incidental, must not be condoned, urging warring parties to exercise maximum restraint and avoid the use of explosive weapons in populated areas.  The respect for international humanitarian law and international human rights law must be upheld under any circumstance.  Okhmatdyt Hospital was just one of many targets in the heavy missile strike which hit Kyiv and other cities on 8 July, he said, noting that the Russian Federation launched 38 missiles, attacking almost 100 civilian sites.  Noting that the World Health Organization (WHO) has verified 1,878 attacks affecting health-care facilities, personnel, transport, supplies and patients since February 2022, she asserted that “intentionally directing attacks against a protected hospital is a war crime, and perpetrators must be held to account”.

Describing the 8 July attack on the children’s hospital, Volodymyr Zhovnir, the Director of Okhmatdyt, said that at 9:52 a.m., when air raid sirens sounded, the hospital staff began evacuating patients to the bombshell shelter.  “At 10:42 a.m.  Describing the 8 July attack on the facility, he said that at 9:52 a.m., when air raid sirens sounded, the hospital staff began evacuating patients to the bombshell shelter.  Noting ongoing negotiations regarding Summit of the Future, he asked:  “What kind of future are we talking about if the murderer is sitting knee deep in children's blood in the chair’s seat here?”  The representative of the Russian Federation will bypass purgatory and end up in hell forever, he said, calling on the Council to respond to that country’s aggression and war crimes as well as address the issue of its presence in the permanent seat of the Soviet Union.

The representative of the European Union, in its capacity as observer, said that the Russian Federation’s recent large-scale missile attacks are “a stark reminder” of why the Russian Federation Armed Forces are listed by the UN as a perpetrator of grave violations against children.  He stressed: “By targeting Okhmatdyt — a symbol of Ukraine’s childcare medicine — Russia once again demonstrates its cruelty and its utter insincerity about peace talks.”  Further, he pointed to the “striking paradox” of a Member State currently holding the presidency of the Council — the organ responsible for maintaining peace and security — while intensifying, “as we speak”, attacks on civilian infrastructure in Ukraine.  Citing an OHCHR report documenting Moscow’s targeting of energy infrastructure and use of “double-tap” strikes, he stressed:  “These are the facts.”

Against that backdrop, he underscored that the Russian Federation and its leadership must be held fully accountable for waging a war of aggression and for other serious international crimes — “as well as for the massive damage caused by their war”.  The General Assembly will soon vote on a resolution regarding the threats posed to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, as this marks the first time in history that a nuclear power plant — Europe’s largest — has been illegally seized by a foreign aggressor.  “History matters here”, he stressed, stating that history — including the 1986 Chernobyl disaster — teaches the existential importance of nuclear safety and security. “Russia’s irresponsible actions place all of us at risk, and that is why we hope — and expect — that all UN Member States will support this initiative”, he urged.

The representative of Poland said that the Russian Federation forces have targeted the largest Ukrainian nuclear power plant in Zaporizhia, the largest Ukrainian water dam in Khakovka and now Ukraine’s largest children’s hospital in Kyiv.  He cited estimates by media experts that the Kremlin spent as much as $250 million on Monday’s missile barrage against targets in several Ukrainian cities.  Instead of using the money to treat their own children, Moscow “prefers to spend hundreds of millions on killing children in Ukraine”.  “We must move from the logic of domination and force to the logic of diplomacy and the peaceful solution of the conflict”, he said.

Along similar lines, the speaker for Sierra Leone underlined that the devastating impact of the reported overnight missile strikes on civilians is a stark reminder of the urgent need for the violence to end and a renewed commitment to protecting civilian lives and infrastructure in conflict zones.  “It also begs for independent investigations”, he said, urging the involved parties to “choose and prioritize peace”.

On 8 July, Moscow deliberately targeted “perhaps the most vulnerable and defenceless group in any society — children with cancer and other life-threatening illnesses”, said Ukraine’s delegate.  Holding up images of the missile’s flight trajectory, as well as pictures of missile fragments retrieved from under the hospital, he said the footage shows that the hospital was a deliberate target.  Turning to ongoing negotiations regarding the Summit of the Future, he asked:  “What kind of future are we talking about if the murderer is sitting knee-deep in children’s blood in the Chair’s seat here?”

Meanwhile, the representative of the Russian Federation, Council President for July, spoke in his national capacity to counter that a missile from the Ukrainian air defence hit the children’s hospital in an attempt to intercept a Russian missile that was meant to hit a factory.  He pointed out that this tragedy — which falls within the pattern of Ukrainian and Western propaganda — occurred on the eve of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) summit.  “If this was a Russian strike, there would have been nothing left of the building and all the children would have been killed and not wounded”, he said, emphasizing that Moscow does not strike civilian targets in Ukraine.

Briefings

JOYCE MSUYA, Acting Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, said that, since June, “there has been no respite for civilians in Ukraine” amid continuing waves of attacks across the entire country.  “I was particularly shocked by yesterday’s deadly missile strikes on Kyiv, Kryvi Rih, Pokrovsk, Dnipro and other urban centres”, she stated.  These attacks struck vital energy infrastructure, as well as two of the country’s leading specialist hospitals for children and women."

**A network of Russia-based websites masquerading as local American newspapers is pumping out fake stories as part of an AI-powered operation that is increasingly targeting the US election, a BBC investigation can reveal.**

**A former Florida police officer who relocated to Moscow is one of the key figures behind it.**

The following would have been a bombshell report - if it were true.

Olena Zelenska, the first lady of Ukraine, allegedly bought a rare Bugatti Tourbillon sports car for 4.5m euros ($4.8m; £3.8m) while visiting Paris for D-Day commemorations in June. Bugatti issued a sharp denial, [calling it "fake news"](https://www.instagram.com/stories/bugatti_paris/3403151154050783240/)
, and its Paris dealership threatened legal action against the people behind the false story.

But before the truth could even get its shoes on, the lie had gone viral.

! <image:1733>!A fake version of an invoice from a Bugatti dealership, with a "FAKE" stamp on it <image:1736>

Several errors - including spelling mistakes, punctuation and the use of English - were noticed on this fake invoice. Some have been roundly ignored but others have been shared by influencers and members of the US Congress.

The story of the Bugatti hit many of the top themes of the operation – Ukrainian corruption, US aid spending, and the inner workings of French high society.

Another fake which went viral earlier this year was more directly aimed at American politics.

It was published on a website called The Houston Post – one of dozens of sites with American-sounding names which are in reality run from Moscow - and alleged that the FBI illegally wiretapped Donald Trump’s Florida resort.

It played neatly into Trump’s allegations that the legal system is unfairly stacked against him, that there is a conspiracy to thwart his campaign, and that his opponents are using dirty tricks to undermine him. On Tuesday, he denied any knowledge of the story about the Bugatti sports car.

But at other times he has bragged about his prowess in spreading fake news.

At one point he also implied that his activities are a form of revenge against American authorities.

“For me it’s a game," he said. <image:1733>!YouTube Screenshot of a YouTube video featuring false claims that Mr Zelensky bought a mansion from King Charles III <image:1748>YouTube

A YouTube video narrated by an AI-generated voice was planted as the source for the false story that Mr Zelensky bought a £20m mansion from King Charles III

Microsoft researchers also say the operation is attempting to spread stories about UK politics – with an eye on Thursday’s general election – and the Paris Olympics.

One fake story – which appeared on the website called the London Crier – claimed that Mr Zelensky bought a mansion owned by King Charles III at a bargain price.

It was seen by hundreds of thousands of users on X, and shared by an official Russian embassy account."

From [Source](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/olena-zelenska-false-claim-she-bought-bugatti/): 
Content: "Car Lovers Group said the invoice is not theirs, and it contains errors that show it's fabricated, including the lack of required legal details and an incorrect price for the vehicle. 

Russian [disinformation networks](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-targets-americans-traveling-to-paris-olympics-with-fake-cia-video/)
 have spread similar false claims about Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his family in the past year, including a false claim that he bought two luxury yachts for millions of dollars, and a false claim that Zelenska bought over $1 million worth of jewelry at Cartier in New York City.

Clément Briens, a senior threat intelligence analyst for cybersecurity company Recorded Future, told CBS News that false stories about corruption are created to undermine Western support for Ukraine and "erode trust in the leaders, their institutions, and international alliances."

The falsehoods play into existing [concerns](https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2023/index/ukr)
 and documented reports about corruption in Ukraine, researchers say.

Darren Linvill, a Russian disinformation expert and professor at Clemson University in South Carolina, said the false claims are "framed for a very particular audience that wants to hear and is ready to hear that and repeat it."

Linvill said the narratives have managed to gain traction online, despite being debunked — likely because of the cost and status of the brand used by the network. Bugatti Paris — which is operated by Autofficina Parigi, a Car Lovers Group company — [said](https://www.instagram.com/p/C86tVZWKjLS/?hl=en&img_index=2)

 video that falsely claims the first lady of Ukraine, Olena Zelenska, purchased a $4.8 million Bugatti sports car has racked up millions of views on social media, CBS News has found. The video is part of a Russian disinformation campaign aimed at degrading Western support for Ukraine, researchers said. 

CBS News determined the video was [created using artificial intelligence](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-targets-americans-traveling-to-paris-olympics-with-fake-cia-video/)
. A TikTok spokesperson told CBS News their [policies](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/integrity-authenticity)
 do not allow misinformation that may cause harm and the company removes content that violates these guidelines.

While it's not clear who created the video, an early version of it [appeared](https://veritecachee.fr/2024/07/01/olena-zelenska-est-devenue-la-premiere-proprietaire-de-la-toute-nouvelle-bugatti-turbillon/?swcfpc=1)
 in an article on a French website called Verite Cachee — or in English, Hidden Truth — on July 1. Researchers from threat intelligence company Recorded Future [linked](https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/TA-2024-0628.pdf)
 the website to a Russian disinformation network they call CopyCop, which uses sham news websites and AI tools to publish false claims as part of influence campaigns. 

The article included a fabricated invoice purporting to be from Bugatti to dupe readers further. "I think Bugatti has something to do with it," he said.

Olena Zelenska, the wife of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in Kyiv on June 18, 2024.

London CNN  — 

A deepfake video that wrongly suggested the wife of [Ukrainian](https://www.cnn.com/world/europe/ukraine)
 President Volodymyr Zelensky purchased a luxury car during the couple’s visit to Paris last month is likely part of a Russian-linked disinformation network, according to CNN’s analysis and disinformation experts.

The AI-generated [video](https://x.com/aussiecossack/status/1807774973047758873)
 features a non-existent employee of the Bugatti dealership in Paris claiming Olena Zelenska purchased its new model, the Bugatti Tourbillon, for 4.5 million euros (around $4.8 million) on June 7.

The clip has several markings of a deep fake, from cuts in the video, to the strange accent and lip-and-mouth movements, according to Clément Briens, a researcher at cybersecurity company Recorded Future. Yet, it gathered some 18 million views in 24 hours on X, where it was reposted by pro-[Russian](https://www.cnn.com/world/europe/russia)
 influencers.

Bugatti said in a statement on Tuesday that its dealership in Paris, operated by Autofficina Parigi, a Car Lovers Group company, was victim of several criminal offenses and “firmly denounced this disinformation campaign.”

“A supposed salesman claiming to belong to the Car Lovers Group and its sports label Schumacher Group, published a video on social networks in which he indicated that the Bugatti Paris dealership sold a vehicle to the Ukrainian presidential couple,” it said, adding that the group “strongly denies both the existence of the transaction and, consequently, the existence of the invoice.”

“The mandatory legal details don’t appear on the invoice, the price of the vehicle is also wrong, the price of the options and their descriptions are inaccurate and inconsistent, the graphics are outdated, and the Car Lovers Group would never have allowed such a document to be issued,” the statement added.

The group also said it has taken legal action “by filing a criminal complaint for forgery, use of forgeries, usurpation of identity and defamation” – but did not specify against whom the complaint was filed.

Clarity, an AI cybersecurity startup that is fighting against deepfakes, told CNN that their review of the video indicated “a high certainty for AI manipulations, mostly around the middle of the face area.”

The video originates from a French-language website, Verite Cachee France (sic), whose content appears to be AI-generated by scraping French media.

A CNN analysis shows Verite Cachee was set up recently, on June 22, 2024, and some of its pages still have prompts with AI to create fake articles at the top of the piece. “Only minor change with this campaign is that the video doesn’t seem to be on YouTube.”

In a [report](https://tigerprints.clemson.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1002&context=mfh_reports)
 [](https://tigerprints.clemson.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1002&context=mfh_reports)
from last December, Linvill and Patrick Warren, also a professor at Clemson, showed how the disinformation campaign was led by DC Weekly, a website that published a series of AI-generated Russian propaganda and fake stories, such as the debunked claim that Olena Zelenska bought $1.1 million jewellery at Cartier in New York last September.

A [report by Recorded Future](https://www.recordedfuture.com/russian-and-iranian-influence-networks-target-french-elections)
, a leading cybersecurity company, also identified Veritee Cachee as being part of the same disinformation network.

Given the size and resources of the network, it is likely some Russian support or financing is happening, Clément Briens, a senior threat intelligence analyst at the company, told CNN.

“They scrape articles automatically from a number of sources, using LLMs to introduce specifically political bias to attack Zelensky, Biden and NATO."

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=2025_London_Summit_on_Ukraine&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Aim")\
\]

The objective of the meeting was to create a "[coalition of the willing](/wiki/Coalition_of_the_willing_(Russo-Ukrainian_War) "Coalition of the willing (Russo-Ukrainian War)")
" in Europe that would be able to present a peace plan for Ukraine.[\[1\]](#cite_note-Reuters-1)
 The stated [aim of the initiative](/wiki/Coalition_of_the_willing_(Russo-Ukrainian_War)#Aims "Coalition of the willing (Russo-Ukrainian War)")
 is to facilitate the [peace negotiation attempts](/wiki/Peace_negotiations_in_the_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine "Peace negotiations in the Russian invasion of Ukraine")
 launched and mediated by the [United States](/wiki/United_States "United States")
 between Ukraine and Russia in February 2025, by helping to build up strong enough [security guarantees](/wiki/Defense_pact "Defense pact")
 for Ukraine to ensure that a potential reached ceasefire or peace deal would be lasting.[\[3\]](#cite_note-3)
 Besides serving the role as building up a potential peacekeeping force, the coalition have also expressed readiness to increase military support for Ukraine and strengthen economic sanctions against Russia, in the event that the ongoing negotiations for a "comprehensive ceasefire" or "peace deal" would fail. Development of a "[coalition of the willing](/wiki/Coalition_of_the_willing "Coalition of the willing")
    " consisting of multiple nations prepared to defend the terms of any peace agreement and guarantee Ukraine's security afterward

### Commitments

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=2025_London_Summit_on_Ukraine&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Commitments")\
\]

As part of the announcement, Starmer committed £1.6 billion (€1.94 billion) in [UK export finances](/wiki/UK_Export_Finance "UK Export Finance")
 to purchase more than 5,000 air defense missiles for Ukraine.[\[10\]](#cite_note-UKmissiles-10)
 The missiles will be manufactured in [Belfast](/wiki/Belfast "Belfast")
 in Northern Ireland.[\[10\]](#cite_note-UKmissiles-10)
 This complemented a previously announced £2.2 billion (€2.42 billion) loan for [military aid to Ukraine](/wiki/List_of_military_aid_to_Ukraine_during_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War "List of military aid to Ukraine during the Russo-Ukrainian War")
 backed by frozen Russian assets.[\[11\]](#cite_note-11)
[\[12\]](#cite_note-12)

Starmer emphasized that European nations would need to take primary responsibility for the initiative and "do the heavy lifting"[\[10\]](#cite_note-UKmissiles-10)
 and that the agreement would require US backing and Russian involvement. In addition, he said that the role of the countries that are Russia's neighbours will be different from providing peacekeeping troops.[\[17\]](#cite_note-17)

UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Sunday, March 2, warned that European security faces a once-in-a-generation moment at the start of Ukraine crisis talks in London, just days after an [explosive clash](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/03/01/ukraine-s-fate-more-precarious-than-ever-after-trump-s-dramatic-clash-with-zelensky_6738700_4.html)

, sitting next to Zelensky and in front of the flags of Ukraine and European nations, said it was "a once-in-a-generation moment for the security of Europe and we all need to step up." He told Zelensky, "I hope you know that we are all with you and the people of Ukraine for as long as it takes. It was a stark contrast to Zelensky's unusually heated Friday meeting with Trump in Washington, where he was berated by the American leader and accused of not being "ready" for peace with Russia.

U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer hosted a meeting that saw leaders of 18 countries at Lancaster House convene to discuss the foundation of a potential ceasefire with Russia that includes strong security guarantees for Ukraine. 

Held on March 2 and called the European Defense Summit, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and representatives of international institutions, including NATO head Mark Rutte, and the European Union attended the event.

“The leaders discussed continued financial support for Ukraine’s defense industry, including investments in domestic arms production, as well as increased funding for Europe’s defense sector,” the Ukrainian president’s office [said](https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/spilni-dii-dlya-zakinchennya-viini-spravedlivim-mirom-ta-gar-96433)
.

Specifically, representatives from Ukraine, Germany, France, Italy, Denmark, Spain, the Netherlands, Poland, Norway, the Czech Republic, Sweden, Romania, and Türkiye, as well as NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, and European Council President António Costa. Moreover, Kyiv must be included in any peace negotiations, the leaders agreed.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz called Russia’s demand for the “demilitarization” of Ukraine “unacceptable.”

“We must learn from the past,” said European Council President António Costa. 

“We cannot repeat the Minsk experience,” he said regarding the two failed ceasefires that were brokered after Russia’s initial invasion in 2014 when the Crimean Peninsula was illegally annexed. 

Ac[cording](https://www.dw.com/uk/bezpekovij-samit-u-londoni-ukraina-otrimala-zapevnenna-u-pidtrimci/live-71800338)
 to German broadcaster Deutsche Welle, Costa said that “we cannot repeat the tragedy of Afghanistan. Peacekeeping must go hand in hand with maintaining peace.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen [said](https://x.com/vonderleyen/status/1896260421734355267)
 that Ukraine must be turned into a “steel porcupine”, indigestible for potential invaders, and announced an increase in defense expenditures.

“It is now of utmost importance to step up the defence investment for a prolonged period of time. And we need, in the strategic environment in which we live, to prepare for the worst, and therefore stepping up the defense,” she said.

The summit participants agreed to form a “coalition of the willing” to protect Ukraine and guarantee peace in the country.

Work will continue on developing a specific peace plan, based on proposals from France and the UK. 

French President Emmanuel Macron has suggested a month-long ceasefire for Ukraine, covering air, sea, as well as energy sectors. 

Starmer confirmed that the UK is also ready to close the skies over Ukraine to ensure its safety. and European countries.

A stronger defense plan for Europe will be unveiled at the next meeting of European leaders.

August 25,2025 Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also participated.

They unanimously reiterated their support for Ukraine and confirmed that sanctions against Russia, including holding frozen Russian assets, will remain in place until a lasting peace is achieved.

“The ceasefire should begin with the exchange of prisoners and the return of \[Ukrainian\] children. This step will demonstrate Russia’s genuine intent for peace,” their joint statement read.

The role of the United States in ensuring sufficient support and maintaining transatlantic unity to end the war was also emphasized.

Starmer reiterated that Ukraine must continue receiving military aid from its partners, and that economic pressure on Russia must remain in place. He also stressed that any lasting peace must guarantee Ukraine’s sovereignty and security.

A peace agreement must involve Russia, but the Kremlin cannot dictate its terms. The plan will be presented to the United States for consideration.

The summit took place amid deteriorating relations between Washington and Kyiv, following a dispute between Zelenskyy and his U.S."

  !Britain’s Prime Minister, Sir Keir Starmer (left) welcomes Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky to 10 Downing Street on March 1, 2025, in London. "And if we want to be at all."

Meanwhile, the Eiffel Tower was lit up on Friday night in the Ukrainian flag colors of blue and yellow.

### From European leaders, "unwavering support" for Ukraine

Speaking earlier on Saturday, Starmer said he spoke to both Trump and Zelenskyy after the uncomfortable Oval Office meeting. His office issued a statement that said Starmer "retains unwavering support for Ukraine, and is doing all he can to find a path forward to a lasting peace based on sovereignty and security for Ukraine."

But one of his ministers, Douglas Alexander, called the fracas in the White House "deeply troubling and sobering." Starmer's chief political opponent, Conservative party leader Kemi Badenoch, posted on social media that "respectable diplomacy" was essential for peace, and that a "divided West only benefits Russia."

Europe's leaders will meet in London on Sunday, at Starmer's invitation, to discuss their next steps after the Oval Office episode in Washington.

The European Union's most powerful leader, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, told Zelenskyy [in a message posted on social media](https://x.com/vonderleyen/status/1895565933265260843)
 on Friday that his "dignity honors the bravery of the Ukrainian people," adding an encouragement that he "be strong, be brave, be fearless," and concluding "you are never alone."

Within just an hour or two of the Oval Office meeting, similar expressions of support and solidarity online came from the Spanish premier, Pedro Sánchez, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda, Latvian Prime Minister Evika Siliņa and President Edgars Rinkēvičs, Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre, Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala and President Petr Pavel and many others, including Australia's premier, Anthony Albanese.

Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson, whose country recently ended centuries of neutrality in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine to join the NATO alliance, said Sweden stood with Ukraine, which was fighting for its own freedom, as well as Europe's.

Germany's current chancellor, Olaf Scholz, and the likely next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, also voiced their support, as Germany's foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said her country and other European allies stood united "alongside Ukraine — and against the Russian aggression." She said Ukraine could rely on "unwavering" support from Berlin, as well as elsewhere in Europe, and minutes later her Dutch counterpart, Caspar Veldkamp, said Kyiv could rely on the Netherlands' support too. ambassador](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5309799/trump-china-europe-foreign-policy)

EU foreign policy chief and former Estonian President Kaja Kallas went further in her direct criticism of Trump, saying, "it became clear today that the free world needs a new leader," adding, that "it's up to us Europeans, to take this challenge."

In one country bordering Ukraine, Poland, Prime Minister Donald Tusk who, as president of the European Council, regularly met with Trump during his first term, expressed support for Ukraine too. The Ukrainian President arrived in London on Saturday to meet with the British prime minister ahead of a summit of European leaders on Sunday.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy got a warm welcome in London on Saturday as leaders across Europe rallied to his defense on the heels of an extraordinary [Oval Office clash](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5313079/trump-zelenskyy-meeting)
 in which President Trump accused the Ukrainian leader of "gambling with World War III."

### [Zelenskyy leaves the White House early after Trump meeting gets heated](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5313079/trump-zelenskyy-meeting)

In Zelenskyy's first official meeting since the row — which also included Vice President JD Vance and took place in full view of the media — British Prime Minister Kier Starmer embraced Zelenskyy as the two met at 10 Downing Street. Starmer told the Ukrainian leader that he has "full backing across the United Kingdom."

Meanwhile, many of Europe's leaders pushed back against the Trump administration's perceived alignment with Russia's leader Vladimir Putin and the apparent browbeating of Zelenskyy.

### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources discuss the London Summit on Ukraine, held on March 2, 2025. The summit, organized by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, aimed to create a "coalition of the willing" to present a peace plan for the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Participants included leaders from 16 states, the EU, and NATO. The summit resulted in a four-point plan and commitments from Starmer, including financial aid and the purchase of air defense missiles for Ukraine. The summit was attended by 18 countries, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, to discuss a potential ceasefire with Russia and security guarantees for Ukraine.

The summit included a group photo of the leaders, including Volodymyr Zelensky. The leaders discussed continued financial support for Ukraine's defense industry.

From 9 Dec 2024

**Volodymyr Zelenskyy** floated the idea on Monday of foreign troops being deployed to Ukraine until the country joins the **Nato** military alliance.

He made the remark during a joint press conference in Kyiv with the German opposition leader Friedrich Merz, as Donald Trump’s imminent return to the White House intensifies talk of a possible deal to end Russia’s 33-month-old war.

Ukraine, which has made a concerted push to obtain an invitation to join Nato, has insisted throughout the war that it needs security guarantees to prevent Russia launching another invasion after the current hostilities are halted.

“A troop contingent from one country or another could be present in Ukraine for as long as it isn’t part of Nato. We can think about that and work on Emmanuel Macron’s proposal,” Zelenskyy said.

The Ukrainian leader told reporters he was hoping [to call outgoing US president Joe Biden in the coming days](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/dec/09/russia-ukraine-war-live-donald-trump-ceasefire-call-volodymyr-zelenskyy?page=with:block-6756d0808f08d291b219b7e3#block-6756d0808f08d291b219b7e3)
 to discuss Nato membership.

We have some more comments made by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at [the joint press conference](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/dec/09/russia-ukraine-war-live-donald-trump-ceasefire-call-volodymyr-zelenskyy?page=with:block-6756d7dc8f08cefeb937e8ff#block-6756d7dc8f08cefeb937e8ff)
 with German opposition leader Friedrich Merz in Kyiv.

“Ukraine wants this war to end more than anyone else. We can think about that and work on Emmanuel Macron’s proposal,” Zelenskyy said.

The Ukrainian leader told reporters he was hoping [to call outgoing US president Joe Biden in the coming days](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/dec/09/russia-ukraine-war-live-donald-trump-ceasefire-call-volodymyr-zelenskyy?page=with:block-6756d0808f08d291b219b7e3#block-6756d0808f08d291b219b7e3)
 to discuss Nato membership.

!Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy talks during his meeting with the German opposition leader Friedrich Merz in Kyiv. Not the civilian population, not infrastructure, but the military targets from which your country is being attacked,” Merz told Zelenskyy in the Ukrainian capital today.

“With these range limits, we are forcing your country to fight with one hand tied behind your back,” he added.

Ukraine will soon get another €4.2bn ($4.4bn; £3.5bn) in funds after the EU’s member states approved the planned payment of the money, [the EU council has announced](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2024/12/09/council-approves-second-payment-of-over-42-billion-under-the-ukraine-facility/)
.

The money, which forms part of the EU’s [Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine)
 facility, will help the country’s struggling economy, which has been hit by a reduction in exports and the closure of many businesses owing to Russia’s war.

The EU council wants the money allocated to Ukraine as quickly as possible “given the difficult fiscal situation in Ukraine”.

The G7 group of the world’s biggest economies have earmarked an overall loan of €47.3bn ($50bn; £39bn) for Ukraine, serviced by profits generated by Russian assets frozen in the west.

----------- A strong Ukraine before any diplomacy means a strong (Ukraine) on the battlefield,” he said, implying Kyiv needed help to become stronger.

Among Zelenskyy’s inner circle, there is an increasing awareness that, as [Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia)
 continues to make battlefield gains, some kind of negotiations will be necessary soon.

But the Ukrainian leader wants more weapons from allies – and security guarantees – so he can negotiate with Moscow from a position of strength, if it comes to that.

**Volodymyr Zelenskyy** floated the idea on Monday of foreign troops being deployed to Ukraine until the country joins the **Nato** military alliance.

At a press conference in Oslo, reported on by the news agency AFP, and a day before he receivs the 2024 Nobel Peace Prize at a formal ceremony in Oslo, Tanaka added: “Nuclear weapons are things which must never be used.”

We have some more comments from **Friedrich Merz**, frontrunner in the race to become Germany’s next chancellor, who is on a visit to Kyiv today to meet [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://www.theguardian.com/world/volodymyr-zelenskiy)
.

Merz, the leader of the centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), used the trip to condemn his country’s policy on arming [Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine)
 as akin to making the country fight with one arm tied behind its back.

German chancellor [Olaf Scholz has resisted Zelenskyy’s requests for Germany’s Taurus cruise missile](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/04/uk-urges-germany-to-give-long-range-missiles-to-kyiv-despite-luftwaffe-leak)
, whose range and power he fears would dramatically escalate the conflict and potentially drag Germany into it more directly. It came after **Donald Trump** said Kyiv is ready to make a deal with Moscow to stop the war and that **Vladimir Putin** should make efforts toward negotiating a truce.

#### Another flub

Between his meeting with Zelenskyy and the press conference, Biden introduced the Ukrainian president at a separate event to sign the compact, but mistakenly called him President Putin — the Russian leader at war with Zelenskyy’s country — before correcting himself.

When asked about the blunder, Biden acknowledged that he made the mistake but said that he corrected it immediately.

“I thought it was the most successful conference I’ve attended in a long time and find me a world leader who didn’t think it was,” he replied.

Biden did not stumble earlier in the week [when he delivered remarks](https://kansasreflector.com/2024/07/09/biden-commends-nato-strength-pledges-more-aid-for-ukraine-against-russia/)
 at NATO’s 75th anniversary event; rather, his voice remained steady and firm as he opened the ceremony for leaders from the 32 member nations.

WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden dug in on his 2024 reelection bid Thursday at a solo press conference following the NATO summit in Washington, despite a growing list of rank-and-file Democrats and high-profile supporters urging him to abandon his campaign over suspected health concerns.

The highly anticipated press conference followed weeks of speculation about Biden’s ability to hold office and whether he should remain in the 2024 presidential election against former President Donald Trump. “No poll says that.”

Harris is seen as the likeliest replacement for Biden if he were to leave the race.

A trickle of congressional Democrats calling for him to leave the race [since](https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/texas-us-house-member-calls-biden-withdraw-amid-debate-fallout)
 July 2 [turned](https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-camp-works-stem-growing-democratic-unease-over-reelection-prospects)
 to a stream this week — with some reports indicating a poor performance Thursday night could give way to a flood.

Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a decades-long friend of Biden’s, [urged](https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/nancy-pelosi-it-s-up-to-biden-to-decide-if-he-s-going-to-run-214554181531)
 colleagues in an MSNBC interview Wednesday to “let (Biden) deal with this NATO conference, this is a very big deal.”

At the time Biden began his Thursday press conference, 14 Democrats in Congress had explicitly called for him to leave the race, with others suggesting it.

Shortly after the press conference concluded, two more, Connecticut’s Jim Himes and California’s Scott Peters, called on Biden to step aside.

Biden should “make room for a new generation of leaders,” Himes, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, wrote in a statement [posted to X](https://x.com/jahimes/status/1811558379661185359)
.

Peters’ statement was [provided to Politico](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/07/11/congress/how-dem-lawmakers-viewed-bidens-performance-00167743)
.

#### Emphasis on foreign policy

Biden, who has rarely held press conferences, consulted a list of reporters and took questions that ranged from his fitness to serve as president to his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.

He lauded his accomplishments in office and said his job performance showed he was still up for the job.

“If I slow down, I can’t get the job done, that’s a sign that I shouldn’t be doing it,” he said. <image:13356>](https://sourcenm.com/2024/07/12/biden-at-nato-press-conference-rebuts-doubters-im-the-best-qualified-to-govern/)

President Joe Biden holds a news conference at the 2024 NATO Summit on July 11, 2024 in Washington, D.C. joining two dozen allies in signing the Ukraine Compact to “(a)ffirm that the security of Ukraine is integral to the security of the Euro-Atlantic region and beyond.”

Biden [sat down](https://www.c-span.org/video/?536945-1/president-biden-meets-ukrainian-president-zelensky)
 with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy earlier Thursday to underscore military assistance including “working with our NATO allies to ensure Ukraine is flying F-16s this summer.”

Zelenskyy thanked Biden for his “support and personal statement” following Russia’s strike on a children’s hospital in Kyiv Monday. <image:13359>\

[! His comments were worthy of attention given Harris would likely become the nominee if Biden were to step down.

#### Biden attacks Trump on NATO

Biden declared the summit a “great success” and underlined the U.S. This time, no one cowered in appeasement, especially the United States,” Biden said.

Prior to taking questions, he attacked Trump’s record of disparaging NATO and its foundational commitment to defend fellow member nations. And I remind all Americans, Article Five was invoked only once in NATO’s long history, and that was to defend America after 9/11,” Biden said.

The three-day summit largely centered on Russia’s ongoing bombardment and occupation of parts of Ukraine."

Content: "President-elect calling for ceasefire and talks
*   Ukraine prepares key allies meeting in December

KYIV, Dec 9 (Reuters) - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy made the case on Monday for a diplomatic settlement to [Russia's war in Ukraine](https://www.reuters.com/topic/event/ukraine-crisis/)
 and raised the idea of foreign troops being deployed in his country until it could join the NATO military alliance.

The remarks at a joint press conference with German opposition leader Friedrich Merz were the latest to signal Kyiv's increasing openness to war negotiations, with [Donald Trump](https://www.reuters.com/topic/person/donald-trump/)
 preparing to return to the White House on Jan. 20.

The U.S. A strong Ukraine before any diplomacy means a strong (Ukraine) on the battlefield," he said, implying Kyiv needed help to become stronger.

He received a [rhetorical boost](/world/europe/german-opposition-chief-visits-ukraine-war-dominates-election-campaign-2024-12-09/)
 from Merz, the frontrunner in the election race to become Germany's next chancellor, who used his visit to liken Berlin's current policy to making Ukraine fight with one arm tied behind its back.

FOREIGN TROOPS
--------------

Zelenskiy also returned to an idea raised in February by Macron, who floated the possibility of European nations [sending troops to Ukraine](/world/europe/paris-conference-belie-doom-gloom-ukraine-elysee-says-2024-02-25/)
. He suggested that some part of troops of a country be present on the territory of Ukraine, which would guarantee us security while Ukraine is not in NATO," Zelenskiy said.

"But we must have a clear understanding of when Ukraine will be in the EU and when Ukraine will be in NATO," he added.

Kyiv, which has made a concerted push to obtain an invitation to join NATO, has insisted throughout the war that it needs security guarantees to prevent Russia launching another invasion once the current hostilities are halted.

"If there is a pause while Ukraine is not in NATO, and even if we had the invitation, and we would not be in NATO, and there will be a pause, then who guarantees us any kind of security?" Zelenskiy asked at the press conference.

Russia has demanded that Ukraine abandon its NATO ambitions and sees Kyiv's membership of the alliance as an unacceptable security threat.

The Ukrainian leader told reporters he was hoping to call outgoing U.S. And there is no point in discussing with President Trump something that is not up to him today - while he is not yet in the White House," Zelenskiy said.

Zelenskyy open to Western troops providing security in effort to end war in Ukraine
===================================================================================

[World](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world)
 Dec 9, 2024 10:54 AM EDT

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday that he’s open to the potential deployment of Western troops in Ukraine to guarantee the country’s security as part of a broad effort to end the almost three-year war with Russia.

The deployment would be a step toward Ukraine joining NATO, Zelenskyy said in a post on his Telegram channel.

“But before that, we must have a clear understanding of when Ukraine will be in the European Union and when Ukraine will be in NATO,” Zelenskyy said.

His proposals tread a delicate diplomatic path amid international efforts to find a way of ending Europe’s biggest conflict since World War II at a time when Russia has gained an upper hand in the fighting.

U.S. President Joe Biden about Ukraine’s possible NATO membership because he’s still in office, while Trump doesn’t yet have “legal rights” to decide on the matter.

“He wants to have a cease-fire,” Trump said of Zelenskyy in comments to the New York Post published Sunday. President-elect Donald Trump is seeking to bring about a ceasefire and met with Zelenskyy in Paris on Saturday. We didn’t talk about the details.”

Putin’s forces are taking heavy losses in Ukraine, Trump noted.

“I’m formulating a concept of how to end that ridiculous war,” he said.

The possibilities of Ukraine joining the 32-nation NATO military alliance and of Western troops being stationed on its soil have been deeply divisive and contentious issues since Russia’s full-scale invasion began on Feb. 23.

We're not going anywhere.

 [Associated Press](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/author/associated-press) But Zelenskyy said Monday that he would approach outgoing U.S. 24, 2022.

[**READ MORE:** NATO and Ukraine to hold emergency talks after Russia’s attack with new hypersonic missile](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/nato-and-ukraine-to-hold-emergency-talks-after-russias-attack-with-new-hypersonic-missile)

At their summit in Washington in July, NATO declared Ukraine on an “irreversible” path to membership, but stopped short of inviting the country in. The United States and Germany have balked at Ukraine joining NATO while at war with Russia.

One obstacle has been the view that Ukraine’s borders would need to be clearly demarcated before it could join so that there can be no mistaking where the alliance’s pact of mutual defense would come into effect. Macron declined to provide details about which nations were considering sending troops, saying he preferred to maintain some “strategic ambiguity.”

Ukraine’s forces are weathering a monthslong onslaught by Russia centered on the eastern Donetsk region, where Kyiv’s defenses are creaking.

Zelenskyy said on X that over the past week alone, Russia launched nearly 500 powerful guided bombs, more than 400 attack drones and almost 20 missiles of various types against Ukraine.

“Ukraine wants this war to end more than anyone else. We do seek it,” he said.

Zelenskyy thanked Biden for the latest U.S."

The Reuters article confirms that Zelenskyy stated on December 9, 2024, "And there is no point in discussing with President Trump something that is not up to him today - while he is not yet in the White House." This statement aligns with the claim.


## Final Judgement
The initial search provided evidence of Zelenskyy discussing NATO membership with Biden on December 9, 2024, but did not include the specific quote from the claim. A subsequent search revealed a Reuters article confirming that Zelenskyy did indeed state, "And there is no point in discussing with President Trump something that is not up to him today - while he is not yet in the White House," on the same date.

The claim is factually accurate as it is supported by evidence from a reliable source. `true`

LONDON, Nov 25 (Reuters) - A Russian man serving time in prison for burning a copy of the Koran was found guilty by a court on Monday in a separate treason case and sentenced to 14 years in prison.

A regional court in Volgograd in southwestern Russia said it had convicted Nikita Zhuravel, 20, of state treason for corresponding online with a member of the Security Service of Ukraine and for acts "directed against the security of the Russian Federation."

Sign up [here.](undefined?location=article-paragraph&redirectUrl=%2Fworld%2Feurope%2Frussian-man-jailed-burning-koran-sentenced-14-years-separate-ukraine-treason-2024-11-25%2F)

Zhuravel's case drew attention last year when Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov published video showing his son Adam, then 15, beating and kicking him while he was in prison in Chechnya awaiting trial for burning a Koran in Volgograd, his hometown.

Kadyrov, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, has cast himself as a staunch defender of the Islamic faith in the overwhelmingly Muslim republic, where Zhuravel was transferred after what Russian investigators said was public pressure from Chechens.

The office of Russia's Prosecutor General said last month that Zhuravel had also been accused of sending footage of a freight train carrying warplanes, and information about the movements of a car linked to a Russian military base to a representative of Ukrainian intelligence.

Zhuravel had pleaded guilty to the crime, the court said in a statement on Telegram on Monday, adding that he had been opposed to what Moscow calls its special military operation in Ukraine. Russia rarely comments on individual criminal cases.

Zhuravel is serving a three-and-a-half-year sentence following his [conviction](/world/europe/court-russias-chechnya-sentences-man-3-12-years-koran-burning-tass-2024-02-27/)
 in February under Russia's law against offending religious believers. [Skip to main content](#main-content)

!Court in Russia's Chechnya hears case of man who burned Koran copy <image:1874>

Defendant Nikita Zhuravel attends a court hearing in the Chechen capital of Grozny, Russia, February 27, 2024. Investigators said he had confessed to publicly burning the Koran in a stunt paid for by Ukrainian intelligence.

It was not clear under what circumstances the alleged confession was made.

The number of such cases has risen sharply in Russia since the start of the war in Ukraine, as intelligence agencies pursue a crackdown on suspected foreign spies and agents.

Yevgeny Smirnov, a member of a Russian lawyers' association called Pervy Otdel (First Department) which has in the past helped defend people accused of treason, said Russia's Federal Security Service, the FSB, sometimes tries to entrap people.

He said the FSB contacts people known to be opposed to the war over the internet and encouraged them to commit crimes, such as setting fire to military buildings or sending sensitive information related to the Russian military.

Reuters could not independently verify his assertion."

A young Russian man previously jailed in the republic of Chechnya for burning the Quran was sentenced to an additional 13 years and six months in prison on charges of treason, Russian media [reported](https://v1.ru/text/gorod/2024/11/25/74375216/ "reported")

The human rights group Memorial has designated Zhuravel a political prisoner.

Following the widely publicized incident, several regional authorities awarded the younger Kadyrov state honors.

On Monday, the Volgograd Regional Court [convicted](https://v1.ru/text/gorod/2024/11/25/74374478/?sharePost=1237723&utm_campaign=5961503_1237723&utm_medium=v1.ru&utm_source=sharepostonline "convicted")
 Zhuravel of “high treason,” sentencing him to an additional 13 years and six months at a maximum-security prison, according to the v1.ru news website.

He will now spend a total of 14 years in prison on the combined charges, prosecutors [said](https://epp.genproc.gov.ru/web/gprf/mass-media/news?item=99306845 "said")
 later on Monday.

It remains unclear whether Zhuravel pleaded guilty to the new treason charges. Never miss the latest news from Russia. Russia's Prosecutor General's Office has designated The Moscow Times as an "undesirable" organization, criminalizing our work and putting our staff at risk of prosecution. This follows our earlier unjust labeling as a "foreign agent."

These actions are direct attempts to silence independent journalism in Russia."

Man beaten in police custody for burning Quran gets 13.5 years for ‘treason’ against Russia in separate case

The man convicted this February of burning a copy of the Quran had another 13.5 years added to his prison sentence on Monday. Factoring in time already served, Nikita Zhuravel will spend the next 14 years incarcerated following a court ruling in Volgograd.

Police arrested Zhuravel in May 2023 for burning a Quran in front of Volgograd’s Cathedral Mosque, supposedly in coordination with Ukraine’s intelligence community, in an alleged scheme to incite sectarian conflict. In October 2024, several months after his first conviction, prosecutors charged Zhuravel with volunteering to collaborate with Ukraine’s security services. Officials accused him of providing Kyiv with videos of Russian military equipment and aircraft, including the movements of a specific vehicle in the unit."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that in November 2024, a man named Nikita Zhuravel was sentenced to 14 years in prison. However, the Reuters report indicates that the 14-year sentence was for treason, separate from his previous conviction for burning the Quran. The Moscow Times and Meduza state that the 14-year sentence is the total time served, which includes an additional sentence for treason and a previous sentence for burning the Quran.

​​​​​​​**LONDON**

The Italian Prime Minister said Tuesday she understands the US approval of the use of long-range missiles for Ukrainian strikes inside Russia, but Italy made a different choice, according to Italian news agency, ANSA.

Giorgia Meloni told reporters at the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro that the US decision was a "response" to Russia's war against Ukraine.

She said, however, that Italy pledges "support" for Ukraine as long as there is a war there.

US President Joe Biden has allowed Ukraine to use US long-range missiles to strike deep inside Russia.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Tuesday in response that the use of Western missiles by Ukraine may be considered an attack by a non-nuclear state with nuclear support, potentially justifying Russia's use of nuclear weapons.

Moscow has revised its nuclear doctrine, reducing the barriers to deploying nuclear weapons in a conflict. 

"We have always been focused on the issue of anti-aircraft defense," said Meloni. **Please contact us for subscription options.**](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/p/subscription/1001)

Remarks
=======

by NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte with the President of the United States of America, Donald J. Which is totally logical, and this is building on the tremendous success of the NATO Summit, the 5% but also the decision to keep Ukraine strong and the decision to increase our defense industrial production.

  
So based on that, that was Europe stepping up. So if I was Vladimir Putin today, and are you speaking about what you were planning to do in 50 days, and this announcement, I would reconsider whether I should not take negotiations about Ukraine more seriously than I was doing at the moment, if I was Vladimir Putin. Trump at the White House
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   14 Jul. And the decision is that you want Ukraine what it needs to have to maintain to be able to defend itself against Russia, but you do want Europeans to pay for it. I can tell you that at this moment Germany massively, but also Finland and Denmark and Sweden and Norway, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Canada: They all want to be part of this.

And this is only the first wave. There will be more.

So what we will do is work through the NATO systems to make sure that we know what Ukrainians need. So if we can make packages, of course, in a way, we discussed it this morning with Pete Hegseth at the Pentagon, in a way that, of course, the US will keep on its stockpiles necessary to defend this country, that's absolutely clear.

But it will mean that Ukraine can get its hands on really massive numbers of military equipment, both for air defense, but also missiles, ammunition, etc, etc. But when I'm Ukraine, I think this is really great news for them.

So I really want to thank you for that, and it means Europeans paying for it.

And again, I mentioned all these countries, we will deal with that. And exactly as you said, that might also mean that countries will move equipment fast into Ukraine and then the US later, backfilling it, because speed is of the essence here.

So really, thank you this is important.

MOSCOW and KYIV — President Trump on Monday threatened to punish Russia with heavy tariffs on countries that trade with Moscow if the Kremlin fails to reach a ceasefire deal with Ukraine by September, while promising Kyiv billions of dollars worth of military equipment.

"We're going to be doing very severe tariffs if we don't have a deal in 50 days," Trump said during a White House meeting with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte. "Tariffs at about 100%, you'd call them secondary tariffs."

It was his latest warning against Russian President Vladimir Putin, as Trump becomes increasingly frustrated with the Kremlin leader over his continued war in Ukraine.

President Trump explained that NATO countries would acquire U.S.-made weapons, including Patriot air defense missile systems, and that those countries would provide them to Ukraine.

Speaking Sunday to reporters ahead of the meeting with Rutte, Trump cast the weapons deals as a direct rebuke to Putin. <image:1883>

 a sanctions on/off switch to use as snap leverage with Moscow.

Collectively, the moves cap a stark turnaround in Trump's approach toward President Putin over the Ukraine issue. Trump's frustrations with Russia today might be directed at Ukraine tomorrow.

"Why should they ruin relations completely?" Sergey Poletaev, of the Moscow-based Vatfor analytical platform, said in an interview with NPR.

"In another six months or so, the pendulum could swing back the other way."

"The fact remains that the supply of weapons, ammunition and military equipment from the United States continued and continues to Ukraine," Peskov told reporters.

Russia's main market index jumped on the news that Trump would delay additional sanctions for at least 50 days, during which Trump said he expected Russia to negotiate a peace deal.

Yet several prominent Russian nationalists seized on that timeframe, saying it provided Russia a new deadline for a battlefield victory.

Still, political observers in Moscow recalled the Kremlin is dealing with a mercurial American president. Trump has gone from initially promising he could leverage his personal relationship with Putin to negotiate a quick peace agreement, to now openly criticizing the Kremlin leader as unserious in negotiations to end the war.

While NATO's statement did not state a reason for Rutte's trip, it comes after Mr. leader announcing plans to sell NATO allies weapons that it can pass on to Ukraine.

In a statement, NATO said Rutte will be in Washington on Monday and Tuesday and will also meet with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and members of Congress.

[! Trump teased last week that he would make a "major statement" on Russia on Monday, as Ukraine struggles to repel massive and complex air assaults launched by Russian forces. 

The president also hinted that his administration will send more defensive weapons to Ukraine amid its war with Russia, days after [pausing](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-halting-some-weapons-shipments-ukraine/)
 some weapons shipments.

"We're going to send some more weapons. The Europeans want to limit the interest on the assets to go to Ukraine." 

Rubio said Friday that some of the U.S.-made weapons that Ukraine is seeking are deployed with NATO allies in Europe. It would have an enormous impact on economic behemoths China and India, which account for roughly 70% of Russia's energy trade.

Graham said he and Blumenthal have support for "congressional sanctions with a sledgehammer" that will "go after" Russian President Vladimir Putin's economy and "all those countries who prop up the Putin war machine."

"This congressional package that we're looking at would give President Trump the ability to impose 500% tariffs on any country that helps Russia, and props up Putin's war machine," Graham said. Trump is considering authorizing fresh funding for Ukraine for the first time since he took office in January.

The sources indicated the new funding could be intended to send a message to Russia. Trump has $3.85 billion in leftover Biden-era presidential drawdown authority sitting at his fingertips, which could be used to send American military equipment to Ukraine."

Content: "Stoltenberg was ready to start a nuclear war with Russia, and Rutte is the same way."

The false claims also came in the wake of [Trump's advisers telling _The Wall Street Journal_ in an article published Wednesday that the president-elect](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-russia-ukraine-end-war-1981944)
 "makes his own calls on national-security issues, many times in the moment, particularly on an issue as central as this."

When discussing [his plans for the war in Ukraine](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-russia-ukraine-end-war-1981944)
, Trump has previously said that he would end it "within 24 hours" and in addition to pushing for a ceasefire, his advisers "uniformly recommend freezing the war in place."

_Newsweek_ has found that Rutte made no statements regarding the U.S.' alleged expulsion from NATO on his social media platforms, or during a NATO doorstep statement on Thursday in which he congratulated the president-elect.

Mexican President-elect Claudia Sheinbaum has declined an invitation from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to visit Ukraine, reaffirming Mexico’s commitment to neutrality in international conflicts. 

Zelensky had extended the invitation, hoping for an official Mexican visit to witness the effects of Russia’s invasion. <image:12970>

Mexico played an active role in the United Nations, joining other countries in condemning Russia’s actions and co-sponsoring a resolution urging a ceasefire and protection for Ukrainian civilians. Zelensky also expressed his hope that Mexico, under Sheinbaum’s leadership, would clearly distance itself from Russia.

However, Sheinbaum, set to become Mexico’s first female president on October 1, firmly rejected the invitation. "My main task is to rule in Mexico; I will attend certain international events, which we consider important, but we will not travel much - our responsibility lies here," she stated, pointing to Mexico’s long-standing neutral and pacifist stance in global conflicts.

! Domestically, however, support for the Kremlin has surfaced within Mexico’s governing Morena party, with some leftist members forming a "Mexico-Russia Friendship Committee" shortly after the war began.

Sheinbaum indicated that her administration would continue to focus on internal affairs, echoing AMLO’s approach of limited international travel."

We are an independent media outlet that relies solely on advertising revenue to sustain itself. We will attend some international events that we consider important, but we will not travel much,”_ Sheinbaum said, emphasizing that her administration’s main task will be addressing domestic issues.

The President-elect reaffirmed Mexico’s commitment to maintaining diplomatic relations with all countries, with the exception of Ecuador. Sheinbaum referred to an incident at the Mexican embassy in Ecuador in April as a “violation of sovereignty.” According to [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mexico-invites-putin-presidential-inauguration-russias-izvestia-newspaper-says-2024-08-06/)
, Mexico invited Russian President Vladimir Putin to Sheinbaum’s inauguration ceremony on 1 October.

The claim
---------

On social media, the claim that the Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum is circulating the invitation of the Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj with the words "If I wanted to see a drug addict, I would simply walk through Tijuana".

Set up by: _unknown_

Fact check
----------

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201984%20143'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

**The claim is demonstrably wrong.** Claudia Sheinbaum never made such a statement. A SharePic is currently circulating on social media that ascribes her disrespectful words to the Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj: "If I wanted to see a drug addict, I would simply walk through Tijuana," she is said to have said.

Screenshot [Facebook](https://archive.ph/Kivih)

However, this statement is fictitious.

* * *

\_\_\_STEADY\_PAYWALL\_\_\_

### Background of the alleged statement

In an interview with the Mexican news station [Excelsior,](https://www.excelsior.com.mx/global/muestren-a-mexico-el-horror-que-dejo-rusia-en-ucrania-zelenski-pide-relacion-justa/1673415)
 expressed the wish that Sheinbaum may visit Kiev. The distribution of the wrong quotation on social media is part of a disinformation campaign.

*   **Fake quote** : claim that Sheinbaum Selenskyj described as a "drug addict" is wrong.
*   **Mexican foreign policy** : Sheinbaum referred to Mexico's principle of non -interference in foreign affairs.
*   **Clarification** : A spokeswoman for the President confirmed that the quote was invented.

**Rating:** False

The alleged statement of Sheinbaum
----------------------------------

[office as the first president of Mexico](https://www.tagesschau.de/ausland/mexiko-sheinbaum-amtseinfuehrung-100.html)
 today , is already the target of misinformation. This raises the question of the extent to which satire and humor are used in order to deliberately distribute false information and to promote politically motivated agents.

Paulina Silva, a spokeswoman for the President, [confirmed to Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/fact-check/fabricated-quote-by-sheinbaum-calling-zelenskiy-drug-addict-2024-09-30/)
 that the alleged quote was "completely wrong". He hoped that she could get an idea of ​​the destruction that the war in his country did.

Claudia Sheinbaum politely rejected the invitation to Ukraine and referred to the principles of Mexican foreign policy, which are based on non -interference and peaceful conflict resolution. Also explore our extensive [media education offering](http://mimikama.education/zielgruppen/)

* * *

This content reflects the current state of affairs at the time of publication. This example shows once again how quickly and effectively disinformation can be spread in social media.

In addition, the wrong quote uses an existing defamation: the Ukrainian president is [repeatedly](https://www.mimikama.org/en/zelensky-cocaine-desk/)
 associated with alleged drug use, although there [no evidence](https://www.mimikama.org/en/no-cocaine-zelensky-desk/)
 .

### Conclusion: a lie with consequences

The quote attributed to the Mexican President is fake."

**In fact, Claudia Sheinbaum explained that she will not visit Ukraine yet, as she plans to focus on domestic political issues.**

«If I wanted to look at a drug addict, I’d just take a walk in Tijuana» — this is how the newly elected president of Mexico, Claudia Sheinbaum, allegedly commented on her refusal to visit Ukraine. Since Mexico recognizes the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court, which issued an arrest warrant for Putin back in 2023, Ukraine appealed to the state to arrest the Russian president in the event of his arrival — however, the Mexican side rejected this request as well.

From [Source](https://mexiconewsdaily.com/politics/sheinbaum-trump-mexico-petrified-of-cartels/): 
Content: "President Donald Trump used a bill-signing ceremony on Wednesday to criticize Mexico once again, repeating his claim that drug cartels have “very strong control over Mexico.”

“Mexican authorities are petrified to show up at their office, to go to work because cartels have a tremendous grip \[on the country and its politicians\],” he said.

On Thursday, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum calmly but firmly rejected Trump’s statements as “imprecise” and declared that her administration is not afraid of the drug cartels.

“We have taken firm action against the cartels,” she said, “and, unlike previous administrations, we have not allowed organized crime to infiltrate our security institutions.”

Sheinbaum said U.S. customs officials have corroborated the progress Mexico is making, including a 50% reduction in fentanyl trafficking on Mexico’s northern border.

Additionally, Sheinbaum instructed the Foreign Affairs Ministry and the Security Ministry to prepare a report on all the actions Mexico has implemented in the fight against drug trafficking and the regulation of precursor chemicals. 1, asserting that Mexico is not doing enough to prevent the region from becoming a “Narco-Trafficking Playground.”

Mexico reacted quickly to [Trump’s tariff announcement](https://mexiconewsdaily.com/business/mexico-30-percent-us-tariff-bilateral-talks/)
 saying it was already taking steps to address the matter.

On Monday, Sheinbaum [responded](https://www.latintimes.com/mexican-president-sheinbaum-says-us-also-has-do-its-part-fight-drug-trafficking-586771)
 by saying the U.S. must “do its part” with regard to the fentanyl crisis, particularly recognizing the demand resulting from the rise in addiction among youth in the U.S.

“As long as they fail to recognize that they have a serious public health problem, this will never be solved,” she said.

The newspaper La Jornada noted that Trump placed the blame for the opioid crisis exclusively on Mexico and the drug cartels, ignoring the role that addiction plays.

Indeed, the first guest invited to speak at the bill-signing ceremony was a man whose son overdosed on fentanyl after getting addicted to opioids, not by illicit drugs but via drugs prescribed by a hospital.

The Mexican president also said the U.S. into Mexico must be addressed,” she said, adding that more must be done with regard to the arrest of those involved in drug trafficking in the United States.

#### Russian counteroffensive in Korenevo district

The Russian army reportedly launched a counteroffensive operation in Kursk Oblast on 10 September, with reports of Russian advances in the [Korenevo District](/wiki/Korenevo_District "Korenevo District")
. She said that Ukraine would be conducting humanitarian operations in the area, that international humanitarian organizations would be allowed to enter, and that [safe corridors](/wiki/Humanitarian_corridor "Humanitarian corridor")

On 13 September, Zelenskyy acknowledged the Russian counter-attack but claimed there had been "no serious (Russian) success", adding that "It gave the results that, frankly speaking, we counted on" and reiterated claims that it had adversely affected Russian operations in Kharkiv and Donetsk Oblasts.[\[332\]](#cite_note-334)
[\[333\]](#cite_note-335)

### United States

The [White House](/wiki/White_House "White House")

 On 8 August, Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary [Sabrina Singh](/wiki/Sabrina_Singh "Sabrina Singh")

 On 12 August, [US National Security Council](/wiki/United_States_National_Security_Council "United States National Security Council")
 spokesperson [John Kirby](/wiki/John_Kirby_(admiral) "John Kirby (admiral)")

 On 13 August, President [Joe Biden](/wiki/Joe_Biden "Joe Biden")
 said that the Ukrainian incursion was "creating a real dilemma" for Putin.[\[337\]](#cite_note-339)

### Germany

In response to the Kursk offensive, the German Foreign Ministry stated on 9 August that weapons transferred from Germany to Ukraine become the property of Ukraine and can be used by its armed forces as they deem necessary and correct. It said "the absence of any significant military units of the Russian Federation on the border at the time of the attack and the simultaneous continuous conduct of aggressive military operations for more than 900 days on the territory of sovereign Ukraine is the best proof that Putin is lying again about 'protecting Russia.' He doesn't care about Russia, he is only protecting himself."[\[59\]](#cite_note-cnn-conscripts-61)

[NATO](/wiki/NATO "NATO")
 Secretary-General [Jens Stoltenberg](/wiki/Jens_Stoltenberg "Jens Stoltenberg")
 called the Ukrainian incursion "legitimate" and within Kyiv's right to self-defense, adding that the bloc did not receive prior information about the operation and did not play a role in it.[\[346\]](#cite_note-348)

### Evaluation of the offensive

The _BBC_ reported that the August 2024 offensive was the first incidence since [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II "World War II")
 that Russian territory had been occupied by foreign forces (although other sources state that foreign jihadists occupied some Russian territory during the [War in Dagestan](/wiki/War_in_Dagestan_(1999) "War in Dagestan (1999)")
 in 1999).[\[347\]](#cite_note-349)
[\[348\]](#cite_note-350)
 The incursion has been dubbed the "second battle of Kursk", in allusion to [the 1943 battle](/wiki/Battle_of_Kursk "Battle of Kursk")
 in the same region.[\[349\]](#cite_note-351)
[\[350\]](#cite_note-352)
 The offensive is also larger than earlier ground raids, with at least two [brigades](/wiki/Brigade "Brigade")
 from the regular Ukrainian forces participating. Finally, on the strategic level, to slow Russia's offensive momentum, to shift the narrative and counter Russian talking points about their inevitable victory, and also to boost Ukrainian morale.[\[355\]](#cite_note-357)

Matthew Savill, director of military sciences at the [Royal United Services Institute](/wiki/Royal_United_Services_Institute "Royal United Services Institute")
 (RUSI), said that the Ukrainian incursion into Russia was "the first on this scale with conventional forces, rather than proxies \[or\] 'resistance' groups." He also assessed that [earlier raids into Kursk and Belgorod](/wiki/March_2024_western_Russia_incursion "March 2024 western Russia incursion")
 were designed to probe for Russian weak spots, and that the overall goal of the raid is to dismantle Russia's ability to funnel more troops into the [Kharkiv front](/wiki/2024_Kharkiv_offensive "2024 Kharkiv offensive")
 and that "It's unlikely that the plan is to seriously take Kursk itself, or to try and hold vast swathes of Russian territory."[\[79\]](#cite_note-Politico_August_8-81)
 BBC journalists noted the overall decrease of Russian attacks on the Ukrainian frontline at around 15–17% after the beginning of Kursk raids, which could be the sign of Russia taking forces from the frontline into Kursk Oblast.[\[356\]](#cite_note-358)

[Nico Lange](/wiki/Nico_Lange "Nico Lange")
, former chief of staff at the German [Federal Ministry of Defence](/wiki/Federal_Ministry_of_Defence_(Germany) "Federal Ministry of Defence (Germany)")
, stated that the incursion was likely "to establish a [negotiating position](/wiki/Ukraine%27s_Peace_Formula "Ukraine's Peace Formula")
 and provide relief on other front lines" and that it is unlikely that Ukrainian forces would hold territory in Kursk for long periods of time.[\[79\]](#cite_note-Politico_August_8-81)
 Retired Polish General and former commander of special forces, [Roman Polko](/wiki/Roman_Polko "Roman Polko")
, stated that "It's good that Ukraine is taking actions that surprise the Russians," and that "Ukraine is in a defensive position and is unable to conduct an operation to push Russia from the occupied regions, but Ukraine is defending itself in an active way," and that "One can't allow the Russians to comfortably prepare new attacks."[\[79\]](#cite_note-Politico_August_8-81)

Political analyst [Andreas Umland](/wiki/Andreas_Umland "Andreas Umland")
 suggested that the offensive could bring a quicker end to the war. Kiviselg said that the Russian counterattack in Kursk had "not made significant progress" and had suffered losses, but speculated that the Russian movement may have simply been a probing attack and not the main offensive effort.[\[366\]](#cite_note-368)

By 2 October 2024, nearly two months since the incursion, it was widely agreed that the operation in Kursk had a direct relation with the degradation of Ukraine's eastern front.[\[46\]](#cite_note-AlexHorton-48)
 Ukraine suffered its steepest loss in territory between mid-August to mid-September, which also coincided with Ukraine's incursion into Kursk according to Pasi Paroinen, analyst of the Black Bird Group.[\[46\]](#cite_note-AlexHorton-48)
 Rob Lee further supported his earlier argument, stressing that Kursk had stretched Ukrainian personnel thin, added pressure on units holding the line and exacerbated the manpower issues in Ukraine, which is further made worse with heavy losses of experienced Ukrainian soldiers, coupled with new troops sped to the front with limited training.[\[46\]](#cite_note-AlexHorton-48)

By 20 November 2024, three months into the incursion, Marina Miron, a defence researcher at [King's College London](/wiki/King%27s_College_London "King's College London")
, declared the entire operation to be a costly, strategic failure for Ukraine. Kofman assessed that by early February 2025, the salient created by the offensive had become impossible to hold as Russia had increasingly been able to hinder the use of supply routes.[\[13\]](#cite_note-kursk_gambit_20250401-14)
[\[368\]](#cite_note-370)
 According to another military analyst, Steen Kjærgaard, the US cutting intelligence sharing with Ukraine on 5 March played a major role in Russians retaking Sudzha, with Ukraine lacking information on Russian troop movements.[\[369\]](#cite_note-d947-371)
 Richard Kemp from _[The Telegraph](/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph "The Daily Telegraph")
_ viewed the entire Kursk operation to be a defeat for Ukraine, as Ukraine had lost any "bargaining chip" to trade land for land in any ceasefire negotiations.[\[370\]](#cite_note-Telegraph-372)
 Former military advisor [Nico Lange](/wiki/Nico_Lange "Nico Lange")
 viewed the operation as a success.[\[371\]](#cite_note-:0-373)
 Nick Reynolds, a land warfare expert with the [Royal United Services Institute](/wiki/Royal_United_Services_Institute "Royal United Services Institute")
 said that he hesitated to say that the effort by Ukraine was a strategic mistake, that Ukraine had held the Sudzha pocket for a "remarkable" amount of time, and that the Ukrainian offensive had had a "shaping effect on Russian thinking".[\[45\]](#cite_note-guardian_20250310-47)
 On 26 April 2025, the ISW said that the Ukrainian operation succeeded in diverting some Russian "elite" units from Donbas, but its long-term effects remain to be seen.[\[372\]](#cite_note-374)

The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, an intergovernmental body founded to implement the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention, has said that allegations of chemical weapons use by both sides were so far "insufficiently substantiated."

However, it added that the situation in Ukraine "remains volatile and extremely concerning regarding the possible re-emergence of use of toxic chemicals as weapons."

The meeting between Smirnov and Putin was convened to discuss the ongoing crisis in Kursk, where Ukrainian forces have [continued to make significant headway](https://www.newsweek.com/kursk-ukraine-russia-map-1937768)
 since last Tuesday's [surprise cross-border raid](https://www.newsweek.com/russians-evacuated-ukraines-incursion-turns-kursk-war-zone-1935623)

Smirnov went on to say that, since the start of the incursion, 12 civilians have been killed in the region, with a further 121 injured.

According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, via Telegram, Ukraine has so far lost up to 1,610 servicemembers, over 200 combat vehicles, as well as four anti-aircraft missile systems.

During the Monday meeting, Putin also [reacted to Smirnov's claim](https://www.newsweek.com/russia-ukraine-vladimir-putin-kursk-region-offensive-evacuations-1937925)
 that Ukraine now controls 28 settlements in Kursk, and called on the country's military to "knock the enemy out of our territories."

The president added that that the incursion had closed the door to any potential negotiations with Ukraine, saying: "What kind of negotiations can we have with those who indiscriminately attack civilians and civilian infrastructure, or pose threats to nuclear power facilities? What is there to discuss with such parties?"

The acting governor of the embattled Kursk Oblast has accused Ukraine of poisoning civilians with chemical weapons during the incursion into Russian territory.

During a Monday meeting with [Vladimir Putin](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/vladimir-putin)
, Aleksey Smirnov told the president that a group of workers for the Rosseti power company "came under fire" from Ukrainian forces over the weekend, Russian state-run news agency RT reported.

According to Smirnov, while the workers took cover in a local police station, they were targeted with shells "contain\[ing\] chemical weapons," and alongside several police officers and the head of the village council, were "poisoned" as a result.

_Newsweek_ could not verify the claim made by Smirnov, and has contacted the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry for comment on the governor's allegations.

Accusations of the kind made by Smirnov are far from a new occurrence in the ongoing conflict, and form part of the concurrent propaganda war undertaken by both Moscow and Kyiv in a bid to tarnish the reputation of their opponent.

Since the outbreak of the war, both sides have traded accusations of chemical weapons use, and [other violations of international law.](https://www.newsweek.com/ukraine-says-russian-troops-beheaded-soldiers-donetsk-1914406)

!Russia accused of escalating chemical weapons attacks against Ukraine <image:13418>

Ukraine has called on the international chemical weapons watchdog in The Hague to launch a probe into Russia’s alleged use of toxic munitions against Ukrainian forces. Kyiv’s July 8 [appeal](https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraine-urges-investigation-into-alleged-russian-chemical-weapons-use-2025-07-08/)
 to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) comes amid increasing international alarm over reports of escalating Russian chemical weapons attacks in Ukraine.

The United Kingdom has recently [sanctioned](https://kyivindependent.com/uk-sanctions-russian-officials-and-lab-over-chemical-weapons-use-in-ukraine-06-2025/)
 Russian individuals and an organization for involvement in the transfer and use of chemical weapons in Ukraine. A safer future starts with holding Russia accountable for its alleged chemical weapons violations today.

Iran has recently joined fellow Kremlin allies Armenia and Syria in discovering the limits of Russian support. The new sanctions came shortly after German and Dutch intelligence services [warned](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-use-chemical-weapons-against-ukraine-widespread-dutch-defence-minister-2025-07-04/)

 Russia of utilizing chloropicrin, a banned anti-riot agent first used by Germany during World War One, more than a year ago. However, with no significant costs imposed on the Kremlin in relation to these charges, it appears that Russia continues to expand the use of chemical weapons against Ukraine.

#### As the world watches the Russian invasion of Ukraine unfold, UkraineAlert delivers the best Atlantic Council expert insight and analysis on Ukraine twice a week directly to your inbox.

Dutch and German intelligence agencies claim to have evidence that Russia is increasingly using chemical weapons in a “widespread and standardized” way in Ukraine. Ukrainian military officials say that at least three Ukrainian soldiers have died in connection with Russian chemical weapon use, with more than 2,500 injured troops displaying symptoms consistent with exposure to chemical weapons.

According to Dutch Military Intelligence Agency chief Peter Resink, there have been thousands of instances of Russian chemical weapons use during the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Resink [emphasized](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-use-chemical-weapons-against-ukraine-widespread-dutch-defence-minister-2025-07-04/)
 that the occurrences of chemical weapons use in Ukraine were not the result of “some ad-hoc tinkering” but rather “a large-scale program.”

Russia’s alleged deployment of chloropicrin, which is banned under the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention, has reportedly involved improvised munitions such as “filled light bulbs and empty bottles that are hung from a drone.” The chemical causes severe irritation to the skin, eyes, and respiratory tract, and is [more toxic](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-use-chemical-weapons-against-ukraine-widespread-dutch-defence-minister-2025-07-04/)

**\[1/3\]**Servicemen of the 148th Separate Artillery Zhytomyr Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine prepare to fire a M777 Howitzer towards Russian troops at a position in the front line, amid Russia's attack on Ukraine, in Donetsk region, Ukraine, February 8, 2025.

He called the use of chemical weapons by Russian armed forces "almost standing operating procedure."

*   Summary

*   Dutch military intelligence says Russia uses banned chemical weapons in Ukraine
*   Evidence points to 'large-scale program' of producing and using choking agent, officials say
*   Dutch defence minister urges tougher sanctions
*   Chemical weapons agency not yet asked to investigate
*   Russia has denied similar accusations in the past

THE HAGUE, July 4 (Reuters) - Dutch and German intelligence agencies have gathered evidence of widespread Russian use of banned chemical weapons in Ukraine, including dropping a choking agent from drones to drive soldiers out of trenches so they can be shot, they said on Friday.

Dutch Defence Minister Ruben Brekelmans called for tougher sanctions against Moscow.

"The main conclusion is that we can confirm Russia is intensifying its use of chemical weapons," he told Reuters.

"This intensification is concerning because it is part of a trend we have been observing for several years now, where Russia's use of chemical weapons in this war is becoming more normalized, standardized, and widespread."

Germany's BND foreign intelligence agency confirmed the findings, saying in a statement that it had obtained the evidence alongside its Dutch counterparts. Reuters was first to report on the intelligence.

The head of the Dutch Military Intelligence Agency (MIVD), Peter Reesink, said the conclusions followed "our own independent intelligence, so we have observed it ourselves based on our own investigations."

Reuters has not been able to independently verify the use of banned chemical substances by either side in the Ukraine war.

The United States first [accused](/world/europe/russia-breached-global-chemical-weapons-ban-ukraine-war-us-says-2024-05-01/)
 Russia of using chloropicrin, a chemical compound more toxic than riot control agents and first used by Germany during World War One, in May last year.

Ukraine [alleges](/world/europe/ukraine-says-russia-steps-up-illegal-use-tear-gas-clear-trenches-2024-04-17/)
 thousands of instances of Russian chemical weapons use.

Russia's defence ministry did not immediately respond to a request to comment for this article. Russia has [denied](/world/europe/russia-denies-us-accusation-it-violated-chemical-weapons-ban-ukraine-2024-05-02/)
 using illegal munitions and it has accused Ukraine of doing so.

Maria Zakharova, spokeswoman for the Russian foreign ministry, said on Wednesday that the Federal Security Service discovered a Ukrainian cache of explosive devices in the east of the country containing chloropicrin.

Ukraine has consistently denied such accusations.

The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), a disarmament agency in The Hague with 193 member states, said last year that initial [accusations](/world/europe/russia-ukraine-trade-allegations-chemical-weapons-use-global-watchdog-2024-05-07/)
 levelled by both countries at each other were "insufficiently substantiated".

It has not been asked to conduct a full investigation, which must be initiated by member states.

At least three Ukrainian deaths have been tied to chemical weapons use, Brekelmans said, while more than 2,500 people injured on the battlefield reported chemical weapons-related symptoms to Ukrainian health authorities.

Increased use of chemical weapons by Russia poses a threat not only to Ukraine but to other countries, Brekelmans added.

"We must further increase the pressure. This means looking at more sanctions and specifically not allowing them (Russia) to participate in international bodies like the Executive Council of the OPCW," he said.

Reesink spoke of "thousands of instances" of chemical weapons use, while also citing a Ukrainian figure of 9,000.

Rotating two-year seats on the OPCW council will be up for negotiation in the coming months.

The intelligence findings were presented in a letter to the Dutch parliament on Friday.

LARGE-SCALE PROGRAM
-------------------

Russia is a member of the OPCW and, like the United States, has destroyed its declared chemical weapons stockpiles.

Increased sanctions could happen in conjunction with the European Commission, which has [proposed](/world/europe/eu-envoys-discuss-sanctions-related-russia-chemical-weapons-use-2025-05-07/)
 listing 15 additional new entities and individuals to its sanctions framework, including for suspected use of chemical weapons in Ukraine.

The Dutch military and general intelligence agencies, working with foreign partners, say they have uncovered concrete evidence of intensified Russian chemical weapons production.

This includes heightened research capabilities and the recruitment of scientists for chemical weapons development, Reesink said. If ingested, it can cause burns in the mouth and stomach, nausea and vomiting, as well as difficulty breathing or shortness of breath.

"This isn't just some ad-hoc tinkering at the frontline; it is truly part of a large-scale program. When it comes to teargas, we see that they are also misusing and converting existing munitions to act as the carrier for the gas," he said.

Chloropicrin is listed as a banned choking agent by OPCW, which was created to implement and monitor compliance with the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).

It can cause severe irritation to the skin, eyes, and respiratory tract."

The findings came after Ukraine requested that the OPCW investigate three separate incidents in October 2024 when toxic chemicals were allegedly used along the confrontation lines between Russian and Ukrainian forces in the Dnipropetrovsk region.

The OPCW deployed its technical assistance visit team on two missions to Ukraine to collect documents, digital files, witness testimonies, and environmental samples. [Skip to main content](#main-content)

OPCW Finds More Chemical Weapons Use in Ukraine
===============================================

[Arms Control Today](/sections/arms-control-today)

April 2025  
By [Mina Rozei](https://www.armscontrol.org/about/Mina_Rozei)

The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) has found more evidence of chemical weapons use in Ukraine, it said in a Feb. 14 report.

![A Russian riot-control-agent grenade that Ukrainian armed forces say was found on the battlefield in Ukraine in 2023. 14 that it has more evidence of chemical weapons use in Ukraine. 28, before the council meeting, in which it accused Ukraine of using toxic chemicals as weapons against Russian military and civilians.

The Ukrainian delegation exercised its right of reply at the council meeting by issuing a statement in which it rejected the Russian allegations as “disinformation,” and said Russia “continues to use riot control agents against Ukrainian troops.” At the meeting, the OPCW Technical Secretariat responded to Russia’s accusations by saying that “the secretariat works impartially for the 193 states-parties to the convention, including the Russian Federation.”

April 1, 2025 Following a Ukrainian complaint, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons reported Feb. CS is a riot control agent, which when used in a conflict setting constitutes a violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention. The OPCW Technical Secretariat circulated a note at the most recent Executive Council meeting stating that “the mandate of the secretariat under this \[technical assistance visit\] request was never to look at where the grenades came from but to determine whether they were indeed found along the frontlines.”

This is not the first time that CS has been found on the battlefield in Ukraine. The OPCW confirmed the presence of the CS agent in November after its first technical assistance visit to Ukraine in July. These samples were analyzed independently by laboratories that are part of the OPCW network, and the organization confirmed that the chain of custody was maintained throughout the analysis process.

The laboratory analyses revealed the presence of 2-Chlorobenzylidenemalononitrile (CS), in all three alleged instances."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Wikipedia article on the Kursk campaign ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kursk_campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kursk_campaign)) discusses the incursion by the Armed Forces of Ukraine into Russia's Kursk Oblast, which began on August 6, 2024, but does not mention any chemical attacks. Newsweek ([https://www.newsweek.com/russia-says-ukraine-using-chemical-weapons-kursk-1937987](https://www.newsweek.com/russia-says-ukraine-using-chemical-weapons-kursk-1937987)) reports that the acting governor of the Kursk Oblast accused Ukraine of using chemical weapons, while the U.S. Department of State accused Russia of using chloropicrin. The article includes images of Vladimir Putin (<image:13412>) and damaged buildings and vehicles (<image:13413>).


### Evidence from `web_search`
The Atlantic Council published an article on July 8, 2025, stating that Ukraine has called on the international chemical weapons watchdog to launch a probe into Russia’s alleged use of toxic munitions against Ukrainian forces. The article mentions that the UK has sanctioned Russian individuals and an organization for involvement in the transfer and use of chemical weapons in Ukraine. The article also mentions that Dutch and German intelligence agencies claim to have evidence that Russia is increasingly using chemical weapons in Ukraine. (<image:13418>, <image:13420>, <image:13421>, <image:13422>)

Reuters published an article on July 4, 2025, stating that Dutch and German intelligence agencies have gathered evidence of widespread Russian use of banned chemical weapons in Ukraine.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that both sides have accused each other of using chemical weapons. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that the image depicts a chemical attack by the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the Kursk offensive in August 2024. The search results mention the Kursk offensive and chemical weapons use, but they do not connect the two in the context of the image.

Russia has intensified its use of chemical weapons against Ukrainian soldiers in a serious violation of international law, the Dutch and German intelligence agencies have said.

On Friday, they said there was extensive evidence that Moscow’s forces were using banned products, including the choking agent chloropicrin.

Russia denies using the prohibited weapons, as does Ukraine. And that is, of course, also concerning because if we don’t clarify and publicise what Russia is doing, it’s highly likely these trends will continue,” Reesink added.

Germany’s BND foreign intelligence agency also corroborated the MIVD’s conclusions.

The Russian army was using tear gas as well as “the more dangerous chemical chloropicrin, which can be lethal in high concentrations in enclosed spaces” in Ukraine, the BND said in a statement.

“This represents a more serious violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention, which prohibits the use of this lung warfare agent under all circumstances,” it noted.

Speaking to Reuters about the Dutch and German intelligence reports, Brekelmans, the Dutch defence minister, said that at least three Ukrainian deaths had been linked to Russian chemical weapons, with more than 2,500 people reporting symptoms related to the banned products.

More needed to be done to deter Russia from deploying such weapons, he suggested.

“We must further increase the pressure. This means looking at more sanctions and specifically not allowing them (Russia) to participate in international bodies like the Executive Council of the OPCW (the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons),” Brekelmans said.

The OPCW said last year that Russian and Ukrainian accusations that the other side was using banned weapons were “insufficiently substantiated”.

The disarmament agency, which is based in The Hague and has 193 member states, has not conducted a full investigation, something which can only happen at the request of member states.

Fighting grinds on
------------------

The allegations of increased Russian chemical weapons use came as Ukraine reported the largest ever [Russian drone and missile attack](/news/2025/7/4/russia-ukraine-war-list-of-key-events-day-1226)
 on the country.

A Ukrainian air force official told local media it is the biggest of the war so far, with Moscow firing 539 drones and 11 missiles overnight.

The attacks on Kyiv injured at least 23 people, damaging railway infrastructure and setting buildings and cars on fire, authorities said.

A Ukrainian drone attack on Russia’s Rostov region killed at least one woman and forced the evacuation of dozens of people from their homes, the acting governor said.

In the meantime, on Friday, both countries confirmed that they had carried out their latest prisoner exchange, with neither side giving details about the number of soldiers involved.

The swap followed an agreement made in the Turkish capital, Istanbul, in June.

On the diplomatic front, United States President Donald Trump said he had made no progress, expressing his “disappointment”, during his phone call on Thursday with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, who reportedly [reiterated](/news/2025/7/3/russia-will-not-back-down-on-ukraine-war-goals-putin-tells-trump)
 he would stop his invasion only if the conflict’s “root causes” were tackled.

Trump also said he was planning to discuss the conflict with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday. Chloropicrin is dropped by drones to drive soldiers out of trenches, and then kill them,” Dutch Defence Minister Ruben Brekelmans said in a post on X, referring to Russia’s purported use.

Brekelmans, who is now calling for tougher sanctions against Russia, described the use of chemical weapons as “horrible and unacceptable”.

Peter Reesink, the head of the Dutch Military Intelligence and Security Service (MIVD), confirmed that the findings were based on its own investigations. There were “thousands of instances” of chemical weapons use by Russia, he said.

“This isn’t just some ad hoc tinkering at the front line; it is truly part of a large-scale programme. Zelenskyy said he hoped to speak with Trump about the supply of US [weapons to Ukraine](/news/2025/7/2/us-halts-some-weapons-shipments-to-ukraine)
.

The US said on Tuesday that it was halting some weapons deliveries to Kyiv that were promised under the Biden administration, as Russia intensifies its attacks on Ukraine.

The Biden administration-era pledges, which included various munitions to bolster Ukraine’s defences, are now under review as the Pentagon reassesses current inventory levels. The move could signal a shift in priorities under Trump, who has pressed for a more restrained global military posture.

Missiles for Patriot air defence systems and Hellfire missiles are among weapons being held back, according to US media.

Putin and Trump did not discuss the US decision to halt some shipments of critical weapons to Ukraine, Putin aide Yuri Ushakov said.

The OPCW investigated three incidents in October 2024 in the Dnipropetrovsk region. The OPCW confirmed the presence of the CS agent in November after its first technical assistance visit to Ukraine in July. (<image:1>)


### Evidence from `image_search`
The Voice of America published an article about the Kursk offensive, including an image of an explosion (<image:13427>). ABC News also published an article about the Kursk offensive (<image:13428>). CNN published an article about the Ukraine war (<image:13429>).

All sources discuss the Kursk offensive or the Ukraine war, but none mention a chemical attack by the Armed Forces of Ukraine.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that both sides have accused each other of using chemical weapons. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that the image depicts a chemical attack by the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the Kursk offensive in August 2024. The search results mention the Kursk offensive and chemical weapons use, but they do not connect the two in the context of the image.

Content: "ISW will cover subsequent reports in the January 20 Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment.**

**The Ukrainian General Staff reported on January 18 that Russian forces used ammunition equipped with chemical agents banned by the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) 434 times in Ukraine in December 2024, contributing to a total of 5,389 documented cases since February 2023.**\[1\] Ukraine's radiation, chemical, and biological intelligence units are monitoring Russia's use of banned chemical agents, which include using regulated K-51 and RG-VO grenade launchers to launch munitions containing chemical agents and ammunition containing unspecified hazardous chemicals that are banned in warfare under the 1925 Geneva Protocol and CWC. Ukrainian officials have previously reported on increasingly common instances of Russian forces using chemical substances in combat that are banned by the CWC, to which Russia is a signatory, and the Ukrainian General Staff noted that such violations have been systematic in the Russian military since February 2023.\[2\]

**Key Takeaways:**

*   **The Ukrainian General Staff reported on January 18 that Russian forces used ammunition equipped with chemical agents banned by the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) 434 times in Ukraine in December 2024, contributing to a total of 5,389 documented cases since February 2023.**
*   **Russian forces recently advanced in Kursk Oblast and near Kupyansk, Lyman, Chasiv Yar, Toretsk, Kurakhove, and Velyka Novosilka.**
*   **Ukrainian forces recently recaptured lost positions near Chasiv Yar and Toretsk.**
*   **Russian volunteer military detachments continue efforts to boost manpower by recruiting women into the Russian Armed Forces.**

Russian forces recently advanced along the Russia-Ukraine international border northeast of Kupyansk amid continued offensive operations in the Kupyansk direction on January 19. The Ukrainian General Staff acknowledged recent claims that Russian forces attacked near Stroivka (northeast of Kupyansk along the Russia-Ukraine international border), indicating that a Russian milblogger’s claim that Russian forces advanced north of Topoli (southeast of Stroivka) is accurate.\[10\] A Russian milblogger claimed on January 19 that Russian forces are advancing southwest of Stepova Novoselivka (southeast of Kupyansk), but ISW has not observed evidence of this claim.\[11\] Russian forces attacked northeast of Kupyansk along the Russia-Ukraine international border near Stroivka, east of Kupyansk near Petropavlivka, and southeast of Kupyansk near Pishchane on January 18 and 19.\[12\]

Russian forces continued offensive operations in the Borova direction on January 19 but did not make any confirmed advances. Russian forces continued ground attacks within Chasiv Yar itself and south of Chasiv Yar near Predtechyne, Stupochky, and Bila Hora on January 18 and 19.\[24\] Ukraine's Luhansk Group of Forces Spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Dmytro Zaporozhets reported on January 18 that Ukrainian forces repelled Russian small and medium-sized assaults on the grounds of the Refractory Plant in central Chasiv Yar.\[25\] Elements of the Russian 215th Reconnaissance Battalion (98th VDV Division), drone operators of the Russian "Terek" Cossack Reconnaissance Brigade (reportedly of the volunteer Cossack Assault Corps), and drone operators of the Russian "Sever-V" Brigade (Russian Volunteer Corps) are all reportedly operating in the Chasiv Yar direction; additional elements of the Russian 98th VDV Division and elements of the 200th Motorized Rifle Brigade (14th Army Corps \[AC\], Leningrad Military District \[LMD\]) are reportedly operating in Chasiv Yar itself.\[26\]

Both Ukrainian and Russian forces recently advanced in the Toretsk direction amid continued Russian offensive operations in the area on January 19. A Russian milblogger claimed that Russian forces have seized a quarter of Udachne (southwest of Pokrovsk and Kotlyne), but ISW has not observed geolocated evidence of Russian advances into the settlement.\[33\] The Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) claimed on January 19 that Russian forces seized Vozdvyzhenka (east of Pokrovsk) while another Russian milblogger asserted that Russian forces seized the town sometime between January 12 and 18.\[34\] ISW assessed that Russian forces seized Vozdvyzhenka as of January 2.\[35\] Trehubov reported that Russian forces are prioritizing offensive operations in the Pokrovsk direction and are attempting to advance through vulnerabilities in Ukraine's defensive lines west of Pokrovsk.\[36\] Russian forces continued attacking near Pokrovsk itself; northeast of Pokrovsk near Zelene Pole, Baranivka, Tarasivka, and Vodyane Druhe; east of Pokrovsk near Myrolyubivka, Myrnohrad, Yelyzavetivka, Oleksandropil, and Promin; southeast of Pokrovsk near Lysivka, Kotlyne, Zvirove, Udachne, Uspenivka, Nadiivka, and Novotroitske; and south of Pokrovsk near Zelene and Shevchenko on January 18 and 19.\[37\] A Russian milblogger claimed on January 19 that Russian forces hold positions the northern and eastern sections of Uspenivka and noted that Russian forces' rate of advance in Uspenivka mirrors advances near Nadiivka, Novoandriivka, and Sribne, as Russian forces are taking several days to seize small settlements comprised of two to three streets.\[38\] The Russian milblogger claimed that Russian forces are striking Ukrainian forces with glide bombs near Kotlyne and that fighting is ongoing to the west along the Novoukrainka-Lysivka-Sukhyi Yar line (south and southeast of Pokrovsk) and for the heights near Zelene and Dachenske.\[39\] Elements of the Russian 5th and 110th motorized rifle brigades (both 51st Combined Arms Army \[CAA\], formerly the 1st Donetsk People's Republic Army Corps \[DNR AC\]) reportedly continue to operate near Yelyzavetivka and south of Zelene Pole respectively.\[40\]

Russian forces recently advanced northwest of Kurakhove amid continued offensive operations in the Kurakhove direction on January 19."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence consistently points to accusations of chemical weapons use, primarily against Ukrainian forces, with Russia being the main actor accused. The claim, however, asserts the opposite. There is no evidence to support the claim that the image depicts a chemical attack by the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the Kursk offensive.

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Atlantic Council published an article on July 8, 2025, stating that Ukraine has called on the international chemical weapons watchdog to launch a probe into Russia’s alleged use of toxic munitions against Ukrainian forces. The article mentions that the UK has sanctioned Russian individuals and an organization for involvement in the transfer and use of chemical weapons in Ukraine. The article also mentions that Dutch and German intelligence agencies claim to have evidence that Russia is increasingly using chemical weapons in Ukraine. (<image:13418>, <image:13420>, <image:13421>, <image:13422>)

Reuters published an article on July 4, 2025, stating that Dutch and German intelligence agencies have gathered evidence of widespread Russian use of banned chemical weapons in Ukraine. The article mentions the use of chloropicrin and the involvement of the Dutch Military Intelligence Agency (MIVD). (<image:13426>) Arms Control Today, April 2025, reports that the OPCW found more evidence of chemical weapons use in Ukraine. The OPCW investigated three incidents in October 2024 in the Dnipropetrovsk region. The OPCW confirmed the presence of the CS agent in November after its first technical assistance visit to Ukraine in July. (<image:1>)


### Evidence from `image_search`
The Voice of America published an article about the Kursk offensive, including an image of an explosion (<image:13427>). ABC News also published an article about the Kursk offensive (<image:13428>). CNN published an article about the Ukraine war (<image:13429>).

All sources discuss the Kursk offensive or the Ukraine war, but none mention a chemical attack by the Armed Forces of Ukraine.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that both sides have accused each other of using chemical weapons. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that the image depicts a chemical attack by the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the Kursk offensive in August 2024. The search results mention the Kursk offensive and chemical weapons use, but they do not connect the two in the context of the image.


## Actions
```
web_search("chemical weapons Ukraine Kursk offensive")
image_search("chemical explosion Kursk offensive")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Al Jazeera reported that Dutch and German intelligence agencies said Russia has intensified its use of chemical weapons, including chloropicrin, against Ukrainian soldiers, and includes an image of a Ukrainian soldier in a trench (<image:13418>). The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) stated that the Ukrainian General Staff reported that Russian forces used ammunition equipped with chemical agents banned by the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) 434 times in Ukraine in December 2024, contributing to a total of 5,389 documented cases since February 2023 (<image:13430>, <image:13431>). Neither source mentions a chemical attack by the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the Kursk offensive.


## Elaboration
The evidence consistently points to accusations of chemical weapons use, primarily against Ukrainian forces, with Russia being the main actor accused. The claim, however, asserts the opposite. There is no evidence to support the claim that the image depicts a chemical attack by the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the Kursk offensive.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that Russia has been accused of using chemical weapons in Ukraine, but there is no evidence to support the claim that the image shows a chemical attack by the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the Kursk offensive. Therefore, the claim is demonstrably false. `false`

Furthermore, there is no evidence linking the image to a chemical attack by the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the Kursk offensive.

 said he will not be attending an upcoming [UFC](https://globalnews.ca/tag/ufc/)
 fight in Montreal because he doesn’t “go to Canada anymore” and joked that he would “rather go to Russia.”

Rogan also said Trudeau has “some shaky deals” and added that he would “like to see where the money is coming from.” It is still unclear what deals Rogan was referring to.

If you get Global News from Instagram or Facebook - that will be changing. “I rather go to Russia.”

Story continues below advertisement

One of Rogan’s guests suggested that Canada “may become the U.S.” in reference to U.S. trips over restrictions, safety concerns](https://globalnews.ca/news/11322214/girl-guides-canada-pause-trips-to-us-trump-restrictions/)

Rogan claimed that Canadian authorities froze bank accounts of people who “only donated to the truckers” and that people are “still in jail” for their participation.

“It was kind of when a lot of people woke up,” Rogan added.

This isn’t the first time Rogan has criticized Canada on the podcast.

In March, Rogan [said he didn’t love Trump’s idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8)

2:14 Doug Ford says Trump wanting Canada as 51st state a ‘compliment’ but country ‘not for sale’

Back in July 2022, Rogan [had some strong words about Canada and Trudeau](https://globalnews.ca/news/8997721/joe-rogan-canada-communist-justin-trudeau-sketchy-dictator/)
, voicing his distaste for the country’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Canada’s communist,” Rogan said on the podcast. <image:2033>

Content: "I’d rather go to Russia,” he said, laughing.

Earlier in the show, Rogan remarked that Canada’s government is “terrible” — but said “the Canadian people are awesome.” 

Rogan said in July that his beef with Canada initially began during the COVID-19 pandemic after thousands of protesting truckers [descended on the capital in Ottawa](https://nypost.com/2022/02/14/canadas-trudeau-invokes-emergency-powers-to-quell-protests/)
 and railed against the country’s vaccine mandate, [according to Front Office Sports](https://frontofficesports.com/joe-rogan-canada-massive-ufc-315-event/)
.

President Trump, who Rogan helped throttle to a second term in the White House with an appearance on his podcast days before the 2024 election, has sparked tensions between the US and Canada for [imposing new tariffs](https://nypost.com/2025/03/23/world-news/canadian-pm-mark-carney-calls-snap-election-slams-trump-trade-war/)
 — and suggesting Canada become the 51st state.

The trade war has previously seeped into the sports world, with Canadian fans booing the US national anthem during the NHL-run 4 Nations Face-Off tournament.

Rogan [admitted last month](https://nypost.com/2025/03/22/us-news/joe-rogan-doesnt-want-canada-to-be-us-51st-state/)
 that he does not think Canada should join the union, but wants the two countries to make up and end what he called “the dumbest f–king feud.”

 [!Rogan after a lightweight fight during the UFC 313 event at T-Mobile Arena on March 08, 2025 in Las Vegas, Nevada. UFC commentator Joe Rogan said he won’t go to an upcoming fight because it’s in Canada — joking that he’d “rather go to Russia.”

Rogan gave the brush off on his podcast, “The Joe Rogan Experience,” when asked about UFC 315 in May being in Montreal.

“Wow. I don’t go to Canada anymore,” he said, having previously spoken out against the Great White North’s spat with President Trump.

**Rumor – Vladimir Putin allegedly demanded the extradition of Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci for crimes related to the pandemic as a condition to end the conflict in Ukraine.**

Analysis

Denialist and conspiratorial content involving public figures such as Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci continues to circulate on conspiracy websites.

These publications often reinforce theories of the so-called “new world order,” deny the severity of the Covid-19 pandemic, and portray authoritarian leaders as “saviors” in a battle against global elites. Another example is the false claim that [he was arrested for child trafficking](https://www.boatos.org/mundo/bill-gates-preso-exercito-americano-trafico-de-criancas-outros-crimes.html)
, which was also completely fabricated.

Conclusion

It is false that Vladimir Putin demanded the extradition of Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci as a condition to end the war with Ukraine. Given this, let’s answer the following questions: 1) Did Putin request the extradition of Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci to end the war in Ukraine? 3) Are Gates and Fauci facing any legal actions in Russia?

Did Putin request the extradition of Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci to end the war in Ukraine?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

No. A post claims that Putin demanded the extradition of Bill Gates and Fauci to be tried in Russia for bioterrorism and crimes against humanity.

According to the story, this would be the condition imposed by the Russian president to end the war in Ukraine. There is no official record — whether from the Russian government, credible media, or diplomatic sources — that Vladimir Putin ever made any extradition request involving Bill Gates or Anthony Fauci. These demands have been detailed in reports by [Veja](https://veja.abril.com.br/mundo/as-condicoes-que-putin-pode-impor-ao-acordo-de-cessar-fogo-com-ucrania/)
, [G1](https://g1.globo.com/jornal-nacional/noticia/2025/03/13/vladimir-putin-condiciona-cessar-fogo-com-a-ucrania-a-uma-serie-de-exigencias-como-manter-definitivamente-territorios-que-invadiu.ghtml)
 and [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/14/what-are-putins-conditions-for-a-ceasefire-in-ukraine)
.

Are Gates and Fauci facing any legal action in Russia?
------------------------------------------------------

No. Read:

_Putin demands extradition of Gates and Fauci to face Russian justice for Bioterrorism! It is a work of fiction with no basis in concrete facts or verifiable statements.

What are Putin’s actual conditions to end the war in Ukraine?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Putin’s real conditions for a ceasefire or to end the war in Ukraine have been disclosed multiple times. In this scenario, Vladimir Putin is often depicted as the central figure of an alleged resistance.

Recently, one of these stories has resurfaced."

Evidence Showing Biden Did Not Board 'Empty Plane'

 published that The Independent's White House correspondent [Andrew Feinberg](https://www.independent.co.uk/author/andrew-feinberg)
 — who served as White House pool reporter at Joint Base Andrews — confirmed Biden boarded the plane to greet the people still onboard after the freed prisoners had deplaned. The caption clearly states Biden stepped onto the plane "to talk to the pilot who flew the former prisoners."

The German government has confirmed the release of 15 people “unjustly imprisoned in [Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia)
,” Reuters reported.

**Who is Alsu Kurmasheva?**

Kurmasheva, one of the prisoner freed as part of the exchange, is a Russian-American journalist for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.

A Russian court sentenced the 47-year old in July to six-and-a-half years in prison after a rushed, secret trial.

Kurmasheva, who has two children, was arrested last year during a family visit to the city of Kazan for failing to register as a “foreign agent” and for spreading “false information” about the country’s armed forces.

Stephen Capus, the RFE/RL president and CEO, had denounced her trial and conviction as “a mockery of justice”.

!Alsu Kurmasheva listens to her lawyer during a court hearing in Kazan, Russia on Friday, May 31. “This operation has been recorded in history as the most extensive prisoner exchange between the United States, Russia, and Germany in recent years.”

From what we can see, the exchange is still in process, and hasn’t officially ended until all of the planes have left the tarmac in Ankara.

As part of the exchange, Germany has released a Russian assassin, **[Vadim Krasikov](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/26/vadim-krasikov-who-russian-hitman-navalny-prisoner-swap-claim#:~:text=Explainer-,Vadim%20Krasikov%3A%20who%20is%20Russian%20hitman,to%20Navalny%20prisoner%20swap%20claim%3F&text=Allies%20of%20the%20late%20Russian,convicted%20hitman%20jailed%20in%20Germany.)
**, according to a Turkish presidency statement.

A high-ranking colonel in the Russian secret service FSB, the 58-year old was serving a life sentence in a German jail for [the 2019 murder](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/28/russia-denies-ordering-assassination-of-zelimkhan-khangoshvili-chechen-exile-in-berlin)
 of **Zelimkhan Khangoshvili**, a Georgian-born Chechen dissident, in Berlin’s central Tiergarten park.

Vladimir Putin had made it clear that securing Krasikov’s return to [Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia)
 was his No 1 target.

The Russian leader [alluded](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/09/putin-says-release-of-us-journalist-evan-gershkovich-may-be-possible)
 to him in February, saying the release of the US journalist **Evan Gershkovich** could be secured in a prison swap involving a man, whom he described as a “patriot” serving a life sentence in a “US allied country” after being convicted of “liquidating a bandit”.

In short:
---------

Joe Biden and Kamala Harris welcomed the three Americans released in the prison swap as their plane touched down in Maryland. 

Mr Biden thanked the collective effort of the countries involved in the major international swap. 

What's next?
------------

The swaps, though celebrated with fanfare, have spurred criticism that they incentivise future hostage-taking and give adversaries leverage over the US and its allies.

US President Joe Biden has welcomed home the three Americans who were sentenced to years in Russian penal colonies after secret "sham" trials and now free under a major East-West prisoner swap. 

Mr Biden and Kamala Harris met the plane carrying detainees that landed in the United States on Thursday, local time, in Maryland. 

The president stressed the importance of diplomacy and praised the collective effort of Washington's allies in the multinational deal.

"Alliances make a difference," he said. 

"They stepped up, they took a chance for us, and it mattered a lot.

"I asked them to do some things that were against their immediate self-interest and really very difficult for them to do, particularly Germany and Slovenia," Mr Biden said. 

Vice-President Harris said it was "an extraordinary day".

"You can see it in the families, in their eyes and in their cries."

The freed Americans include the Wall Street Journal's Moscow correspondent Evan Gershkovich, [who was jailed for 16 years last month,](/news/2024-07-19/evan-gershkovich-wsj-sentencing-russia-espionage-case/104120938)

They were both serving sentences on spying charges that the US says were false.

Also released was Alsu Kurmasheva, a reporter for a US-funded radio network in Europe, who was last month jailed for six and a half years for "spreading false information" about the Russian military.

British-Russian dissident Vladimir Kara-Murza, a Pulitzer Prize winner who had written for the Washington Post, was also freed. He said Buenos Nochas."

Earlier on Thursday, former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev, commenting on the prisoner exchange, said that traitors to his country should rot and die in prison, but that it was more useful for Moscow to get its own people home.

"And let the traitors now feverishly adopt new names and actively disguise themselves under witness protection programmes," Mr Medvedev wrote on his Telegram channel.

Six countries release at least one prisoner 
--------------------------------------------

Russia also received three men charged by federal authorities in the US, including Roman Seleznev, a convicted computer hacker and the son of a Russian lawmaker, and Vadim Konoshchenok, a suspected Russian intelligence operative accused of providing American-made electronics and ammunition to the Russian military. 

Norway returned an academic arrested on suspicions of being in a Russian spy; Poland sent back a man it detained on espionage charges.

"Today is a powerful example of why it's vital to have friends in this world," Mr Biden said earlier.

All told, six countries released at least one prisoner.

The Biden administration has now brought home more than 70 Americans detained in other countries as part of deals that have required the US to give up a broad array of convicted criminals, including for drug and weapons offences. 

The swaps, though celebrated with fanfare, have spurred criticism that they incentivise future hostage-taking and give adversaries leverage over the US and its allies.

Tucker, the Journal's editor-in-chief, acknowledged the debate, writing in a letter: "We know the US government is keenly aware, as are we, that the only way to prevent a quickening cycle of arresting innocent people as pawns in cynical geopolitical games is to remove the incentive for Russia and other nations that pursue the same detestable practice."

Though she called for a change to the dynamic, "for now," she wrote, "we are celebrating the return of Evan."

**AP/ABC** He had been sentenced to 25 years' jail for treason in 2023. 

The trade unfolded despite relations between Washington and Moscow being at their lowest point since the Cold War after Russian President Vladimir Putin's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

The swap was coordinated by Türkiye, its intelligence agency said, and the American and German prisoners were taken to its capital, Ankara, before they were able to return home.

Eight Russians — who were being held in the US, Germany, Poland, Norway, and Slovenia — were released too. I will see you again, we will talk about your future." 

On Friday, the Kremlin said Vadim Krasikov was an employee of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB) and had served in Alpha Group, the FSB's special forces unit.

Among those also released to Moscow was a Russian family, the Dultsevs and their two children, whom a court in Slovenia convicted of pretending to be Argentinians in order to spy on the EU and NATO member state.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed that the couple were "illegals" — deep-cover agents trained to impersonate foreigners, who spend years living abroad in their cover identities.

"The children of the 'illegal' intelligence agents who flew in yesterday only learnt that they were Russian after the plane took off (for Moscow) from Ankara," Mr Peskov told reporters.

"Before that, they didn't know that they were Russian and that they had anything to do with our country. And you probably saw that when the children came down the plane's steps that they don't speak Russian and that Putin greeted them in Spanish."

The evidence does not explicitly state that Biden boarded an empty plane after the freed Americans exited. However, the Times of India article mentions that Biden boarded a plane to thank the flight crew. Therefore, the claim is partially supported, but the exact sequence of events is not entirely clear.

Watch: Biden, Harris and families greet freed prisoners on return to the US

Three Americans who were freed in a prisoner swap deal with Russia, including Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, have arrived back on US soil.

Mr Gershkovich, 32, was one of 16 people swapped for eight Russian prisoners in what has been described as the biggest exchange since the end of the Cold War between Russia and the West.

The exchange at an airfield in Turkey also included the release of former US marine Paul Whelan and Russian-American journalist Alsu Kurmasheva.

After touching down at Joint Base Andrews, in Maryland, Mr Gershkovich, Ms Kurmasheva and Mr Whelan emerged from the jet to cheers from those on the tarmac.

All three were greeted by US President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris before they embraced their families.

They lingered on the tarmac for photographs and conversations before leaving the air base within an hour, as did Mr Biden and Ms Harris's motorcades.

Speaking ahead of their return, Mr Biden welcomed their release and declared: "Their brutal ordeal is over."

He praised the role played by America's allies, particularly Germany and Slovenia, and hailed the release of Mr Whelan, Mr Gershkovich and Ms Kurmasheva, as well as leading Kremlin critic Vladimir Kara-Murza, as a "feat of diplomacy".

The three released Americans were then sent to the Brooke Army Medical Centre in Texas for a medical check-up.

The deal had been more than 18 months in the making and appears to have hinged on Moscow's demand for the return of Vadim Krasikov, who was serving a life sentence in Germany for carrying out an assassination in a Berlin park.

The exchange comes after days of speculation about a major swap between various countries, which increased after several dissidents and journalists jailed in Russia were moved from their prison cells to unknown locations.

Although secret prison transfers are common in Russia, the multiple disappearances of well-known prisoners was unusual.

The last high-profile prisoner swap took place in December 2022, when [US basketball star Brittney Griner was exchanged](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-63899465)
 on the tarmac at Abu Dhabi airport for notorious Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout, who had been held in an American prison for 12 years.

The [last comparable one occurred in Vienna in 2010](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10564994)
, when 10 Russian spies held in the US were swapped for four alleged double agents held in Russia.

One of them was Sergei Skripal, a former military intelligence officer, later poisoned by [nerve agent Novichok in Salisbury in 2018](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-wiltshire-60873483)
.

Tensions between Moscow and the West have been high in recent years, especially since the [Russian invasion of Ukraine](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/topics/c1vw6q14rzqt)
 in February 2022.

And Chatham House expert James Nixey told the BBC that while this was a rare good day in relations and a victory for diplomacy, it should not be seen as Russia showing its "softer side".

It merely showed that Russia was determined to get its own people back, whatever crimes they had committed, he said.

"From the Kremlin point of view, it merely confirms that hostage-taking and extortion is a successful tool in its wider geopolitical struggle," he added.

In Russia, President Vladimir Putin personally greeted the Russians released from Western jails with bouquets of flowers at Moscow's Vnukovo Airport.

He embraced them warmly on a red carpet and said they would be given state awards.

Among those returned to Moscow in addition to Krasikov was a Russian couple, convicted of spying in Slovenia, who returned to Russia with their two children.

Russian prisoners arrive in Moscow following swap

German citizen Rico Krieger, who was sentenced to death in Belarus before being [pardoned by the country's leader Alexander Lukashenko](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce78xl8r2xlo)
 earlier this week, has also been released.

Earlier prisoner swap discussions had included jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, but the offer collapsed [when he died in unclear circumstances in an Arctic penal colony in February](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-68315943)
.

His widow Yulia Navalnaya welcomed the swap, describing it as a "joy".

Three of the released dissidents were former regional leaders of Navalny's anti-corruption network, now branded extremist in Russia. At least one of them, Ilya Yashin, has said in the past he did not want to be involved in a swap.

Another, Andrei Pivovarov, was due to be released within Russia in September after completing his sentence, his mother told the Insider website in an interview.

Oleg Orlov, 71, is a veteran Russian human rights campaigner and a founder of the long-standing and recently banned Memorial organisation.

The 13 also seem to include Mr Kara-Murza, who has dual UK-Russian citizenship and is resident in the US."

The BBC News article ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2g2dx7d9wo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2g2dx7d9wo)) confirms that the freed Americans emerged from the jet and were greeted by Biden and Harris.

 she doesn’t believe there’s a larger conspiracy behind her brother’s killing.

“I don’t believe it was targeted,” she told the publication. Detectives believe the suspects were possibly burglarizing White’s vehicle, when he interrupted them.”

 and his supporters are now alleging that an Infowars reporter who was killed outside of his home in Austin, [Texas](https://www.latintimes.com/search/site/Texas)
, was murdered by [Ukrainian](https://www.latintimes.com/search/site/Ukraine)
 forces in a targeted hit, giving rise to yet another conspiracy theory that officials have cast doubt upon.

Infowars reporter Jamie White, 36, was found lying on the ground in a parking lot outside of his apartment complex with gunshot wounds, according to Austin police. Detectives believe the suspects were possibly burglarizing White's vehicle, when he interrupted them," said the police statement.

Jones, Infowars' founder, said the killing "could've been a hit" while being interviewed by conservative commentator Benny Johnson.

"What are the chances in a town of over two million people that an Infowars lead reporter gets butchered?" Jones inquired, despite Austin having a population of less than one million residents.

He continued to allege that White was on a Ukrainian hit list alongside other prominent figures such as billionaire Tesla CEO Elon Musk, and that he had asked the Justice Department to protect him.

"I think Pam Bondi should look into it," Mr. They said they can't really respond to most crime scenes."

White's social media accounts indicate that he himself believed he was on a Ukrainian hit list.

"I'm on the Ukrainian 'Enemies List' due to my work at Infowars and with Alex Jones on the Ukraine proxy war The group who compiled this list is tied to the U.S. White allegedly confronted suspects attempting to break into his vehicle in the parking lot, upon which they shot him and fled the scene, stated Austin police Detective Jason Jones at a Wednesday press conference.

"Homicide Detectives and Crime Scene Specialists responded to process the scene and interview witnesses. The initial investigation shows that White was shot and killed in the parking lot of the apartment complex in which he lived. State Dept, USAID, [CIA](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/cia)
 and George Soros," he wrote in June of 2024.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Jamie White, an InfoWars reporter, was shot dead in Austin, Texas, on March 10, 2025. Alex Jones speculated that the killing could have been a hit orchestrated by Ukraine, and the "Investigate Earth Conspiracy Podcast" mentions that White may have been on a Ukrainian NGO hit list. However, White's sister does not believe there is a larger conspiracy behind her brother’s killing.

The claim is partially supported by the evidence, as it confirms the shooting and the speculation about a Ukrainian hit list. However, the evidence also shows that the claim is disputed.

The evidence does not provide definitive proof that White was on a Ukrainian enemies hit list.

! His sister and local police believe that his death was unrelated to his journalistic activities.**

[Pro-Russian sources](https://archive.ph/MWRtT)
 have spread manipulative headlines claiming that InfoWars reporter Jamie White was allegedly murdered shortly after Ukraine added him to its kill list. Ultra-right-wing and conspiracy-minded InfoWars journalist Jamie White was indeed murdered in Austin on the evening of March 9, on his way home from work. However, White frequently spread disinformation and anti-Ukrainian conspiracy theories, including claims about American bio-labs in Ukraine and that the Maidan protests were orchestrated by Barack Obama’s administration.

Moreover, the journalist’s sister, Kelly Neal, does not believe White was deliberately targeted. He was shot by a person or persons trying to break into his car for the second time_,” [she told The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/crime/jamie-white-infowars-murder-alex-jones-b2712630.html)
. And in June 2024, he [claimed](https://archive.ph/R7Dq4)
 on his X account that he had been added to a “list of enemies of Ukraine” but he provided no links or evidence that this list existed. Russian propagandists assumed he was referring to Myrotvorets, but White’s name does not appear in that database. Law enforcement officials [share that view](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/12/us/infowars-murder-alex-jones.html)
: police said White caught the perpetrators trying to steal his car, at which point he was shot."

[Alex Jones](https://www.latintimes.com/search/site?q=Alex+Jones)
 and his supporters are now alleging that an Infowars reporter who was killed outside of his home in Austin, [Texas](https://www.latintimes.com/search/site/Texas)
, was murdered by [Ukrainian](https://www.latintimes.com/search/site/Ukraine)
 forces in a targeted hit, giving rise to yet another conspiracy theory that officials have cast doubt upon.

Infowars reporter Jamie White, 36, was found lying on the ground in a parking lot outside of his apartment complex with gunshot wounds, according to Austin police. Detectives believe the suspects were possibly burglarizing White's vehicle, when he interrupted them," said the police statement.

Jones, Infowars' founder, said the killing "could've been a hit" while being interviewed by conservative commentator Benny Johnson.

"What are the chances in a town of over two million people that an Infowars lead reporter gets butchered?" Jones inquired, despite Austin having a population of less than one million residents.

He continued to allege that White was on a Ukrainian hit list alongside other prominent figures such as billionaire Tesla CEO Elon Musk, and that he had asked the Justice Department to protect him.

"I think Pam Bondi should look into it," Mr. They said they can't really respond to most crime scenes."

White's social media accounts indicate that he himself believed he was on a Ukrainian hit list.

"I'm on the Ukrainian 'Enemies List' due to my work at Infowars and with Alex Jones on the Ukraine proxy war The group who compiled this list is tied to the U.S. One news app.

### Evidence from `web_search`
Jamie White, an Infowars writer, was shot in Austin, Texas. Alex Jones speculated that the killing "could’ve been a hit” orchestrated by Ukraine, while White's sister does not believe there is a larger conspiracy behind her brother’s killing. According to the Latin Times, White was found dead in a parking lot outside his apartment complex in Austin, Texas. The police believe the suspects were possibly burglarizing White's vehicle when he interrupted them. Alex Jones alleged that White was murdered by Ukrainian forces and was on a Ukrainian hit list. White's social media accounts indicated that he believed he was on a Ukrainian hit list. The "Investigate Earth Conspiracy Podcast" discusses the murder of Jamie White in Austin, Texas and mentions that White may have been on a Ukrainian NGO hit list.

However, White's sister does not believe there is a larger conspiracy behind her brother’s killing.

The claim is partially supported by the evidence, as it confirms the shooting and the speculation about a Ukrainian hit list. However, the evidence also shows that the claim is disputed.

The evidence does not provide definitive proof that White was on a Ukrainian enemies hit list.

A timeline of territorial shifts during Russia’s war on Ukraine
===============================================================

[World](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world)
 Aug 18, 2025 2:27 PM EDT

Russia’s troops are continuing their slow war of attrition in eastern and northern Ukraine, even as the conflict enters a pivotal phase with a series of high-level meetings that are part of U.S. Russian troops quickly reach Kyiv’s outskirts, but their attempts to capture the capital and other cities in the northeast meet stiff resistance.

March 5, 2022 — Russian advances toward Kyiv and Kherson reach their height. 24, 2022 — Russian President Vladimir Putin launches an invasion of Ukraine from the north, east and south. The port city of Mariupol is surrounded.

April 2, 2022 — Ukraine defeats Russian forces in Kyiv after throwing them back in Chernihiv.

Aug. 30, 2022 — Russia illegally annexes Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions of Ukraine, even though it doesn’t fully control either of the four.

September to November 2022 — Ukrainian forces reclaim vast parts of the Kharkiv, Mykolaiv and Kherson regions in the first counteroffensive, including the city of Kherson itself.

May 22, 2023 — Russia claims control of Bakhmut after months of fighting.

June 6, 2023 — As Ukraine’s long-anticipated second counteroffensive starts, the Russian-controlled Kakhovka Dam explodes, sending a wall of water into southern Ukraine and upending Ukrainian battle plans.

Fall 2023 — The second Ukrainian counteroffensive ends, with little change to the front line.

Feb. House of Representatives approves $61 billion package for Ukraine after months of delay.

May 10, 2024 — Russia launches a new offensive in the northeastern region of Kharkiv, capturing a string of villages and opening a new front in the war.

Aug. The attack is codenamed Operation Spider Web.

Summer 2025 — Russia and Ukraine both step up drone strikes with the ability to strike deep into each other’s territory.

June 30, 2025 — Russia says it has taken full control of Ukraine’s Luhansk, one of four regions that Moscow illegally annexed in September 2022. 29, 2022 — Ukraine’s first counteroffensive starts in the east and south.

Sept. 18, 2024 — Russian forces take complete control of the eastern city of Avdiivka after months of combat.

April 19, 2024 — The U.S. 6, 2024 — Ukraine launches a lightning incursion into Russia’s Kursk region, holding territory along the border in an unexpected and embarrassing episode for the Kremlin.

Content: "Putin responded by invading Ukraine on February 24th, 2022.

Second, the Biden administration has reacted to the outbreak of the war by doubling down against Russia. In response, Russia seized Crimea from Ukraine and helped fuel a civil war that broke out in the Donbass between pro-Russian separatists and the Ukrainian government.

One often hears the argument that in the eight years between when the crisis broke out in February 2014 and when the war began in February 2022, the United States and its allies paid little attention to bringing Ukraine into NATO. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov made the point succinctly at a press conference on January 14th, 2022, when he said, “the key to everything is the guarantee that NATO will not expand eastward.”

Nevertheless, the efforts of Lavrov and Putin to get the United States and its allies to abandon their efforts to make Ukraine a Western bulwark on Russia’s border failed completely. The Causes and Consequences of the Ukraine War
==============================================

_**! We live in perilous times.

Let me now lay out my argument in greater detail, starting with a description of the conventional wisdom about the causes of the conflict.

The Conventional Wisdom

It is widely and firmly believed in the West that Putin is solely responsible for causing the Ukraine crisis and certainly the ongoing war. In his July 12th, 2021, article about Russian-Ukrainian relations, which proponents of the conventional wisdom often point to as evidence of his imperial ambitions, he tells the Ukrainian people, “You want to establish a state of your own: you are welcome!” Regarding how Russia should treat Ukraine, he writes, “There is only one answer: with respect.” He concludes that lengthy article with the following words: “And what Ukraine will be—it is up to its citizens to decide.” It is hard to reconcile these statements with the claim that he wants to incorporate Ukraine within a greater Russia.

In that same July 12th, 2021 article and again in an important speech he gave on February 21st, 2022, Putin emphasized that Russia accepts “the new geopolitical reality that took shape after the dissolution of the USSR.” He reiterated that same point for a third time on February 24th, 2022, when he announced that Russia would invade Ukraine. In short, Russia did not have the capability to subdue all of Ukraine, much less conquer other countries in Eastern Europe.

To take this argument a step further, Putin and other Russian leaders surely understand from the Cold War that occupying counties in the age of nationalism is invariably a prescription for never-ending trouble. Let me now turn to the real cause of the Ukraine crisis.

The Real Cause of the Crisis

The taproot of the crisis is the American-led effort to make Ukraine a Western bulwark on Russia’s borders. From his perspective, that would be a declaration of war.”

The Bush administration, which was pushing such a decision for NATO however, cared little about Moscow’s “brightest of red lines” and pressured the French and German leaders to agree to issuing a public pronouncement that said unequivocally that Ukraine and Georgia would eventually join the alliance.

Unsurprisingly, the American-led effort to integrate Georgia into NATO resulted in a war between Georgia and Russia in August 2008—just four months after the Bucharest summit. He made a series of moves—like shutting down pro-Russian TV stations and arresting an especially close friend of Putin and charging him with treason—that were sure to anger Moscow.

President Biden, who moved into the White House in January 2021, had long been committed to bringing Ukraine into NATO and was also super-hawkish towards Russia."

### Economic aspects

Economic interests were also a motive for Russia's attack on Ukraine and its [annexation of the southeast](/wiki/Russian_annexation_of_Donetsk,_Kherson,_Luhansk_and_Zaporizhzhia_oblasts "Russian annexation of Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia oblasts")
. Control of [lithium](/wiki/Lithium "Lithium")
 deposits in the Donbas and Ukraine's grain wealth would give Russia a "monopoly on the world market".[\[77\]](#cite_note-DD-80)
 In 2022, Russian General Vladimir Ovchinsky confirmed that the "Russian special operation" aimed to seize Ukrainian lithium deposits.[\[24\]](#cite_note-DU-27)
[\[78\]](#cite_note-RA-81)

The US government estimates that Russia's economic losses from the war and Western sanctions will amount to around $1.3 trillion by 2025, and Russia's direct financial spending on the invasion is estimated at $250 billion (as of late 2024) – costs that Russia could not have foreseen."

Top Questions

### 

When did the Russia-Ukraine War begin?

The full-scale invasion of Ukraine by Russia on February 24, 2022, was the expansion of a war between the two countries that had begun in February 2014, when disguised Russian troops [covertly invaded and took control](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Ukraine-crisis#ref323583)
 of the Ukrainian autonomous republic of [Crimea](https://www.britannica.com/place/Crimea)
. British and European officials have also made estimates, while independent researchers and journalists have used open-source data to count losses.

### 

Why did Vladimir Putin invade Ukraine in 2022?

[Vladimir Putin](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Vladimir-Putin)
’s invasion followed years of tension between [Russia](https://www.britannica.com/place/Russia)
 and [Ukraine](https://www.britannica.com/place/Ukraine)
 as Ukraine moved toward closer ties with the West, which Putin viewed as a threat to Russia’s influence. In March 2023 the International Criminal Court concluded that Russia’s mass kidnapping campaign constituted a war crime.

Russia’s [destruction of Kakhovka Dam](https://www.britannica.com/event/2022-Russian-invasion-of-Ukraine/The-Ukrainian-counterattack#ref374607)
 on the Dnipro River in June 2023 is also an example of how Russian forces have attacked Ukrainian infrastructure to inflict suffering on Ukraine’s population: some 240 square miles (620 square km) of territory were flooded, scores of people died, and dozens of towns were inundated, with up to 1 million people left without drinking water.

### 

How has the war in Ukraine impacted Russia’s military capabilities?

Russia’s visually confirmed losses as of early 2024 totaled more than 8,000 armored vehicles, including some 2,700 tanks. In recognition of Russia’s continued hybrid warfare campaign against Ukraine, the framework called for mediated talks between the two governments rather than any attempts at bilateral engagement.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that the 2022 war began on February 24, 2022, with Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The provided timelines show that Zelenskyy was in office during this time and made attempts to negotiate with Putin. However, the evidence does not support the claim that Zelenskyy initiated the war. Instead, the evidence suggests that Russia initiated the war by invading Ukraine.

The evidence also points to underlying causes of the conflict, such as Russia's opposition to Ukraine's potential NATO membership and economic interests. These factors predate Zelenskyy's actions in 2022.

Therefore, based on the provided evidence, the claim is not supported.

“They may have their own relations, but talking about Ukraine without us — it is dangerous for everyone,” Zelenskyy said.

He said his team has been in contact with the Trump administration, but those discussions are at a “general level,” and he believes in-person meetings will take place soon to develop more detailed agreements.

“We need to work more on this,” he said, adding that Trump understandably appeared to be focused on domestic issues in the first weeks after his inauguration.

The nearly three-year war in Ukraine is at a crossroads. But a planned visit by [Trump’s Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg](https://apnews.com/article/trump-transition-ukraine-russia-war-kellogg-68b413ecde625f6643aebe5759a752e7)

, a longstanding wish for Kyiv that Moscow has categorically rejected, is still Zelenskyy’s top choice.

NATO membership is the “cheapest” option for Ukraine’s allies, and it would also strengthen Trump geopolitically, Zelenskyy argued.

“I really believe that these are the cheapest security guarantees that Ukraine can get, the cheapest for everyone,” he said.

“It will be a signal that it is not for Russia to decide who should be in NATO and who should not, but for the United States of America to decide."

[### How SNAP Cuts Affect Your State\
\
The massive budget bill signed by President Donald Trump will result in sharp cuts to food benefits for the neediest Americans. [Trump](https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump)
 said his administration has had “very serious” discussions with Russia, but he did not elaborate.

Zelenskyy said his team has been in contact with the Trump administration, but those discussions are at a “general level,” and he believes in-person meetings will take place soon to develop more detailed agreements.

A planned visit by Trump’s envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellog was postponed. Zelenskyy said Putin interprets negotiating directly with Kyiv as losing.

He said Trump could bring Putin to the table through the threat of sanctions targeting Russia’s energy and banking system, as well as continued support of the Ukrainian military.

NATO is the 'cheapest' security guarantee option

Zelenskyy said NATO membership is the “cheapest” option for Ukraine's allies, and it would strengthen Trump geopolitically.

Other scenarios that involve arming and training Ukraine’s 800,000-strong army would be expensive for U.S. troops.

Approving Ukraine’s NATO bid would be “a great victory” for Trump, Zelenskyy added, in an apparent appeal to the president’s penchant for winners and business deals.

Skepticism about putting European troops in Ukraine

Zelenskyy said a French proposal to put European forces in Ukraine as a deterrent force is taking shape, but he expressed skepticism, saying many questions remained about the command-and-control structure and the number of troops and their positions.

Zelenskyy said he told both French President Emmanuel Marcon and Trump that the option of putting European troops in Ukraine was welcome, but it would not be a sufficient security guarantee alone.

He added: “Imagine, there is a contingent. (AP Photo/Eric Gay)](https://www.usnews.com/object/image/00000197-b27c-d052-a3ff-b27dd7c50000/june-27-pyss-w03.jpg?update-time=1751046429007&size=responsive640)

Best of AP — Second Winner

AP Interview: Zelenskyy says excluding Ukraine from U.S.-Russia talks about war is ‘very dangerous’
===================================================================================================

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy gestures as he speaks during an interview with The Associated Press in Kyiv, Ukraine, Saturday, Feb. While the Kyiv team has tirelessly lobbied the Ukrainian government for access and interviews throughout the country’s nearly three-year conflict with Russia—and secured previous sit-downs with Zelenskyy—this was the first time his office approached AP to propose an interview.

With just hours to prepare, the entire team sprang into action. Reporter Illia Novikov provided live, simultaneous translation, longtime photographer Efrem Lukatsky captured images, and Yurchuk produced the video.

The result: an hourlong interview in which Zelenskyy warned that excluding Ukraine from U.S.-Russia war talks is “very dangerous,” called for Kyiv and Washington to develop a ceasefire plan, and outlined his latest thinking on security guarantees needed for a peace deal and NATO membership.

The judges were impressed by the team’s ability to move quickly and deliver such a polished and impactful interview under intense time constraints. 1, 2025\

Inspector General Robert P. The DoD OIG audit revealed that the DoD did not provide sufficient documentation to support the justification or accuracy of half that total—$1.1 billion. 

As a result, the DoD lacks assurance that $1.1 billion of Ukraine supplemental funds were used as intended, and the DoD OIG considers them questioned costs because, at the time of the audit, the purpose and the accuracy of the costs were not supported by adequate documentation. Without sufficient documentation to justify and verify these payments, the DoD cannot provide assurance or transparency to the public, DoD leadership, or Congress regarding using the Ukraine assistance funds. Additionally, if the DoD does not implement the recommendations in this report, the control issues identified could also apply to the more than $76 billion of additional Ukraine supplemental funding appropriated after 2022.

The DoD OIG made five recommendations to DoD management, including that the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller)/Chief Financial Officer, in coordination with the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, develop and implement guidance that requires DoD Components to document the justification of payments that use supplemental funding appropriated for a specific purpose.

Here's how you know

**Official websites use .mil**

A **.mil** website belongs to an official U.S. Department of Defense organization in the United States.

**Secure .mil websites use HTTPS**

A **lock (lock )** or **https://** means you’ve safely connected to the .mil website. The audit also identified that the DoD Financial Management Regulation did not require DoD Components to document the justification of payments that use supplemental funds for a specific purpose, such as documentation supporting the use of the Disaster Emergency Fund Code value. The DoD OIG also recommended a review of the supporting documentation for the questioned costs to determine whether the payments were accurate and supported the Ukraine assistance mission. 

The DoD OIG will continue to monitor the DoD’s implementation of the recommendations in this report.

Content: "<image:3835>](https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Claim%20-%20Fact%20US%20Ukraine%20Support%202.0_0.png)

**US aid to Ukraine does not lack oversight nor has corruption in Ukraine diverted it.**

Claim: _US aid to Ukraine lacks oversight and is being misused because of corruption in Ukraine._

Fact: US oversight is extensive, and Ukrainian government oversight and accountability is extensive and growing.

*   Critics point to a recent corruption case in which a small Ukrainian defense enterprise embezzled $40 million from public ammunition procurement funds, **without noting that the Ukrainian government caught the thieves and recovered the money.****\[1\]**
*   Ukraine has undertaken significant anti-corruption efforts within its government and defense industrial base enterprises as part of efforts to increase domestic defense production.\[2\]
*   President Zelensky fired the previous defense minister after domestic corruption scandals unrelated to Western assistance emerged, and his replacement, the current minister, is aggressively rooting out corruption.\[3\] The Ukrainian government is also leveraging the robust and expansive Ukrainian NGO community to assist with its anti-corruption efforts.
*   Ukrainian and DoD personnel have been working aggressively to continue to improve monitoring and tracking of US aid, and US DoD officials have stated that there is no evidence that US-provided military assistance to Ukraine has been misappropriated.\[4\]
*   84% of the funds for Ukraine in the current proposed package would go to US companies, the US military, and other allied militaries, not Ukraine, which would get hardware and training from those funds.\[5\]
*   Western-provided weapons are being used as intended.  Mountains of evidence show advanced Western systems being used against Russian forces in Ukraine.\[6\]

**America’s NATO and Asian allies and other European states have committed more money to support Ukraine than the United States.**

Claim: _The United States is giving more support to Ukraine than Europe, and Europe hasn’t stepped up._

Fact: America’s European, Asian, and NATO allies have committed over $178 billion to support Ukraine, which is more than the US will have committed counting the aid package currently under consideration.

*   The EU and its member states have made available $148.5 billion (138 billion euros) - including its recently announced support package of $54 billion (50 billion euros) - to Ukraine since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022.\[7\]
*   The United Kingdom has pledged $15.1 billion (£12 billion) in overall support to Ukraine since February 2022, of which $9 billion (£7.1 billion) is for military assistance.\[8\]
*   Canada has committed $1.8 billion (over 2.4 billion Canadian dollars) in military assistance to Ukraine since February 2022.\[9\] The Canadian military has also has trained approximately 40,000 Ukrainian military and security personnel since 2015, and Canada expanded and extended this program until March 2026.
*   Norway reached a multi-year agreement with Ukraine in February 2023 for a support program that will provide Ukraine with $7 billion (75 billion Norwegian kroner) between 2023 and 2027.\[10\] Norway pledged to allocate to Ukraine around $1.4 billion (15 billion Norwegian kroner) per year and had already provided around one billion dollars (10.7 billion Norwegian kroner) to Ukraine in 2022 and about $1.9 billion (19.9 billion Norwegian kroner) in 2023.
*   NATO member Turkey is building a new drone production facility and service center in Ukraine. Turkey’s leading drone maker, Baykar, announced in September 2023 that Turkey would open a drone production facility and service center for Bayraktar TB2 drones, which reportedly will become operational by early 2025.\[11\]
*   NATO member North Macedonia has sent 10 batches of military aid to Ukraine including Soviet-era military equipment as of November 2023.\[12\] North Macedonia is also training batches of Ukrainian military personnel and pledged to continue supporting Ukraine.\[13\]
*   South Korea is expanding its production of critical 155mm artillery shells to refill Western stockpiles and support the continued provision of ammunition in Ukraine.\[14\]
*   Japan pledged $4.5 billion to Ukraine in December 2023.\[15\] Japan also pledged an additional $37 million contribution to a NATO fund to provide additional support for Ukrainian defense in January 2024.\[16\]
*   Australia provided approximately $590 million (910 million Australian dollars) in overall military and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine as of late October 2023.\[17\]
*   New Zealand provided Ukraine with more than $48.7 million (80 million New Zealand dollars) in military and humanitarian assistance as of July 2023.\[18\]

**Ukraine is not a “forever war” for the United States because Americans are not fighting this war.**

Claim: _Ukraine is another 'forever war' for the United States._

Fact: This is not an American war.  It’s another nation’s war against an American enemy.

*   Ukrainians are fighting this war, not Americans.
*   The US is helping Ukraine fend off the Russian attack to reduce the risk that the US will have to fight Russia in the future. 
*   A Putin victory over Ukraine would embolden him and encourage him to test America’s willingness to defend its NATO allies, increasing the risk of a US-Russia war.\[19\]
*   Russian victory would also let Russian forces move closer to current NATO borders, forcing the US to commit more troops to the defense of its NATO allies.\[20\]
*   Ukraine is building up its own military and defense industry to be able to reduce its dependence on the US and will be able to do so if the US continues its support.\[21\]
*   Ukraine already has a significant defense industry and was one of the world’s leading weapons suppliers before the Russian invasions and is investing its own money and attracting foreign investors to dramatically increase this capability.\[22\]

**Sending military aid to Ukraine increases America’s military readiness and reduces the risk that the United States will have to fight Russia itself.**

Claim: _Sending military aid to Ukraine degrades America's military readiness_.

Fact: Sending military aid to Ukraine has enabled the United States to modernize its own military to be better prepared to fight the next war.

*   The US is supporting Ukraine in part so that the US won’t have to fight Russia itself.
*   The overwhelming majority of military assistance is going to build up the US defense industrial base.\[23\]  It is allowing the expansion of current production lines of essential military supplies that the US military will need in any future war.
*   The equipment the US has been giving Ukraine is mostly old and sometimes inoperable.\[24\]  The US is purchasing new systems to replace what it gives Ukraine, modernizing the American military in the process.
*   American allies are also reinvigorating their defense industries and modernizing their militaries as consequences of support to Ukraine, which benefits the US.\[25\]

**The United States is not sending Ukraine a “blank check.”**

Claim: _The United States is/was sending Ukraine a "blank check."_

Fact: The United States has not given Ukraine a blank check. <image:3836>

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence does not support the claim that Zelenskyy's statement confirms the US aid is a money laundering operation. The AP interview with Zelenskyy on February 1, 2025, is confirmed, but the provided sources do not contain any statements from Zelenskyy that would confirm the claim.

The evidence does include a DoD OIG audit from 2025 that revealed insufficient documentation for $1.1 billion in funds. However, this does not automatically confirm that the aid is a money laundering operation.

The ISW fact sheet states that US aid is not a "blank check" and that both Ukrainian and US officials monitor the aid.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's statement in an AP news interview from February 1, 2025 that his country's military has received only a portion of the more than 175 billion in U.S. aid confirms that the US aid is a money laundering operation."

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Department of Defense Office of Inspector General (DoD OIG) released an audit of the DoD’s execution of funds to assist Ukraine, which revealed that the DoD did not provide sufficient documentation to support the justification or accuracy of half of the total funds, $1.1 billion. The report is from 2025. [Source](https://www.dodig.mil/In-the-Spotlight/Article/3940692/press-release-audit-of-the-dods-execution-of-funds-to-assist-ukraine-report-no/)

The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) published a fact sheet dated February 8, 2024, addressing claims about US aid to Ukraine. <image:3835> and <image:3836> The fact sheet states that US aid to Ukraine is not a "blank check" and that Congress appropriates specific amounts for specific purposes, with both Ukrainian and US officials monitoring the aid. The fact sheet also mentions that America’s European, Asian, and NATO allies have committed over $178 billion to support Ukraine, which is more than the US will have committed counting the aid package currently under consideration. [Source](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/fact-sheet-us-assistance-ukraine)


## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim that Zelenskyy's statement confirms the US aid is a money laundering operation. The AP interview with Zelenskyy on February 1, 2025, is confirmed, but the provided sources do not contain any statements from Zelenskyy that would confirm the claim.

The evidence does include a DoD OIG audit from 2025 that revealed insufficient documentation for $1.1 billion in funds. However, this does not automatically confirm that the aid is a money laundering operation.

The ISW fact sheet states that US aid is not a "blank check" and that both Ukrainian and US officials monitor the aid.

 is spent in the United States, about 25 percent is spent in Ukraine, and the final 15 percent is spent globally.

**Q1: What did President Zelensky say that started this controversy?**

**A1:** In an interview with the _Associated Press_ on February 2_,_ Zelensky [stated](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1igjyyl/zelenskyy_ukraine_received_us76_billion_out_of/)
:

When I hear that America gave Ukraine hundreds of billions \[of dollars\], 177, to be more precise . He speaks about supporting the “army” where aid helped all elements of the Ukrainian armed forces, and he appears to include only weapons as aid “received.”

**Q2: How was that interpreted?**

**A2:** Many people asked where the “missing” $100 billion went and seized on the statement, “I don’t know where all the money is.”

Published February 11, 2025

Remote Visualization

On February 2, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said he had only received $75 billion of the $175 billion the United States had spent on Ukraine. In private conversations, Republican congressional staff members say that the confusion and hint of corruption have poisoned the possibility of further aid, at least in the near term.

**Q3: So, what happened to the “missing” $100 billion?**

**A3:** The short answer is that it is not missing. All rights reserved.

Critical Questions by [Mark F. surge forces in Europe, and intelligence support for both NATO and Ukraine.

As [CSIS has reported before](https://breakingdefense.com/2023/10/most-aid-to-ukraine-is-spent-in-the-us-a-total-shutdown-would-be-irresponsible/)
, “aid to Ukraine” is a misnomer because 90 percent of military aid is spent in the United States. We are talking about specific things, because we got it, not with money but with weapons. I don’t know where all the money is.

The statement is a bit confusing since he was speaking off the cuff in a video interview. [Members of Congress](https://x.com/NancyMace/status/1886175308086161522)
 and Elon Musk, who leads DOGE, [amplified](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1886132832495378684)
 posts questioning the misuse of aids.

General Keith Kellogg, the Trump administration’s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, denied these interpretations."

# Your Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) published an article on February 11, 2025, discussing the controversy surrounding U.S. aid to Ukraine. The article states that in an interview with the Associated Press on February 2, Zelenskyy said he had only received $75 billion of the $175 billion the United States had spent on Ukraine. This statement led to questions about where the "missing" $100 billion went, with some interpreting it as a sign of corruption. The article explains that the aid is not missing, and that a significant portion of the aid is spent in the United States. <image:3388>

President Donald Trump speaks to the media at Mar-a-Lago, Tuesday, February 18, 2025, in Palm Beach, Florida.

Kevin Lamarque/AP

Washington CNN  — 

President Donald Trump is on a lying spree about Ukraine.

In [remarks to reporters on Tuesday](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-remarks-executive-orders-mar-a-lago-february-18-2025)
 and in a [social media post](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114031332924234939)
 on Wednesday, Trump made numerous false claims about Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the Russian war on Ukraine – some of which [echoed](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/18/politics/donald-trump-putin-ukraine-analysis/index.html)
 inaccurate talking points from Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Here is a fact check of some of his assertions.

**Who started the war**

Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Trump dismissed Ukraine’s complaints about its exclusion from US-Russia talks on ending the war – and falsely [said](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/18/politics/video/trump-ukraine-russia-war-zelensky-putin-zeleny-lead-digvid)
 of Ukraine: “You should’ve never started it. Rather, he has taken issue with inflated claims about how much US cash Ukraine has received.

He said in a February 1 [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGq6VrLtqUc)
 with the Associated Press that although people talk about Ukraine getting as much as $200 billion in US aid, Ukraine had received about $76 billion, largely in the form of weapons. Trump’s own former vice president, [Mike Pence](https://x.com/Mike_Pence/status/1892271536394162229)
, and [several](https://x.com/mkraju/status/1892263722455883888)
 [Republican](https://x.com/RepDonBacon/status/1892272315213189590)
 [lawmakers](https://x.com/SenatorRicketts/status/1892225376539050486)
 have noted this obvious fact in the wake of Trump’s lie.

**Zelensky’s approval rating**

In the same Tuesday remarks, Trump called for a new Ukrainian election – last year’s previously scheduled presidential election was [called off because the country is under martial law](https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/30/europe/ukraine-election-zelensky-intl/index.html)
 – and falsely claimed Zelensky is “down at 4% percent approval rating.”

That 4% figure is [not even close to accurate](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/19/politics/fact-check-trump-falsely-claims-zelensky-has-a-4-approval-rating-its-above-50/index.html)
.

The [latest survey](https://www.kiis.com.ua/?lang=eng&cat=reports&id=1496&page=1)
 from a leading Ukrainian pollster, conducted earlier this month, found that 57% of Ukrainians said they trusted Zelensky. service members are mostly spent in the United States, and even some piece of the humanitarian aid is spent in the United States.”

In new comments to reporters on Wednesday, Reuters [reported](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/zelenskiy-says-trump-is-disinformation-bubble-ukraine-2025-02-19/)
, Zelensky said the US has provided about $67 billion in weapons and $31.5 billion in budget support.

 conducted from late November to early January found 63% of Ukrainians either approved fully or tended to approve of Zelensky’s actions as president.

**US wartime aid to Ukraine**

In the Wednesday social media post, Trump falsely claimed that Zelensky “talked the United States of America into spending $350 Billion Dollars” to “go into” an unwinnable war.

The $350 billion figure, too, is far from reality.

According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German think tank that [closely tracks wartime aid to Ukraine](https://www.ifw-kiel.de/topics/war-against-ukraine/ukraine-support-tracker/)
, the US had committed a total of about $124 billion in military, financial and humanitarian aid to Ukraine between late January 2022, just before the Russian invasion, and the end of December 2024; the think tank found the US had actually allocated about $119 billion.

It’s possible to arrive at different totals using different counting methodologies, but there is no apparent basis for Trump’s “$350 billion” figure. Ukraine response funding totals nearly $183 billion, with $130.1 billion obligated and $86.7 billion disbursed” – and that includes funding [spent in the US](https://www.csis.org/analysis/how-supporting-ukraine-revitalizing-us-defense-industrial-base)
 or sent to [countries other than Ukraine](https://www.ukraineoversight.gov/Funding/Security-Programs-Authorities/)
.

**US aid vs. European aid**

In both the Tuesday remarks and the Wednesday social media post, Trump returned to his familiar but false claim about a supposedly massive disparity between the amount of Ukraine aid provided by the US and by Europe.

He said Tuesday: “I think Europe has given $100 billion and we’ve given, let’s say, $300-plus (billion).” He wrote Wednesday: “The United States has spent $200 Billion Dollars more than Europe.”

Neither of those statements are accurate.

In fact, according to the Kiel Institute’s data, Europe – the European Union plus individual European countries – had collectively committed far more total wartime military, financial and humanitarian aid to Ukraine through December (about $258 billion) than the US committed (about $124 billion). Europe had also allocated more military, financial and humanitarian aid (about $138 billion) than the US allocated (about $119 billion).

The US did have a slim lead in one particular category, military aid allocated, providing about $67 billion to about $65 billion for Europe. In reality, Zelensky was saying exactly what experts in the US and elsewhere have [repeatedly](https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-us-aid-going-ukraine)
 [pointed out](https://www.csis.org/analysis/what-ukraine-aid-package-and-what-does-it-mean-future-war)
 – that a large chunk of the total US budgetary “response” to the Ukraine war is not in the form of money handed to the Ukrainian government.

For example, experts at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank [wrote last May](https://www.csis.org/analysis/what-ukraine-aid-package-and-what-does-it-mean-future-war)
: “The notion of ‘aid to Ukraine’ is a misnomer."

## Claim
Claim: "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's statement in an AP news interview from February 1, 2025 that his country's military has received only a portion of the more than 175 billion in U.S. aid confirms that the US aid is a money laundering operation."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Associated Press ([https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-trump-talks-ceasefire-00af5f61f1faf41e78a3b4e072c21a14](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-trump-talks-ceasefire-00af5f61f1faf41e78a3b4e072c21a14)) and U.S. News & World Report ([https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2025-02-01/takeaways-from-the-ap-interview-with-ukraines-zelenskyy](https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2025-02-01/takeaways-from-the-ap-interview-with-ukraines-zelenskyy)) both reported on an AP interview with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on February 1, 2025, discussing the war in Ukraine and potential talks between the U.S. and Russia. Zelenskyy stated that excluding Ukraine from talks would be "very dangerous." <image:k>, <image:2120>, <image:2121>, <image:2122>, <image:2123>

The AP also published an article ([https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/best-of-the-week/second-winner/2025/ap-interview-zelenskyy-says-excluding-ukraine-from-u-s-russia-talks-about-war-is-very-dangerous/](https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/best-of-the-week/second-winner/2025/ap-interview-zelenskyy-says-excluding-ukraine-from-u-s-russia-talks-about-war-is-very-dangerous/)) about the interview, mentioning Zelenskyy's comments on the exclusion of Ukraine from U.S.-Russia war talks and his call for a ceasefire plan.


### Evidence from `web_search`
The Department of Defense Office of Inspector General (DoD OIG) released an audit of the DoD’s execution of funds to assist Ukraine, which revealed that the DoD did not provide sufficient documentation to support the justification or accuracy of half of the total funds, $1.1 billion. The report is from 2025. [Source](https://www.dodig.mil/In-the-Spotlight/Article/3940692/press-release-audit-of-the-dods-execution-of-funds-to-assist-ukraine-report-no/)

The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) published a fact sheet dated February 8, 2024, addressing claims about US aid to Ukraine. <image:3835> and <image:3836> The fact sheet states that US aid to Ukraine is not a "blank check" and that Congress appropriates specific amounts for specific purposes, with both Ukrainian and US officials monitoring the aid. The fact sheet also mentions that America’s European, Asian, and NATO allies have committed over $178 billion to support Ukraine, which is more than the US will have committed counting the aid package currently under consideration. [Source](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/fact-sheet-us-assistance-ukraine)


## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim that Zelenskyy's statement confirms the US aid is a money laundering operation. The AP interview with Zelenskyy on February 1, 2025, is confirmed, but the provided sources do not contain any statements from Zelenskyy that would confirm the claim.

The evidence does include a DoD OIG audit from 2025 that revealed insufficient documentation for $1.1 billion in funds. However, this does not automatically confirm that the aid is a money laundering operation.

The ISW fact sheet states that US aid is not a "blank check" and that both Ukrainian and US officials monitor the aid.

Why are false claims Ukraine 'lost' US money circulating?
---------------------------------------------------------

In an interview with the news agency AP on February 2, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was asked to react to the Trump administration’s freeze on US aid. I don't know where all this money is,” he said.

In the weeks since the interview was [**published**](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-trump-talks-ceasefire-00af5f61f1faf41e78a3b4e072c21a14)
 by AP, Zelenskyy’s comments have been manipulated to suggest that Ukraine held on to the sum of $100 billion it says it did not receive. Some online users have falsely claimed the funding has been misused or laundered.

We found these claims circulating on X, Facebook and TikTok.

How does Trump say he will recuperate money spent on Ukraine?
-------------------------------------------------------------

President Trump says the minerals deal reportedly signed between Washington and Kyiv on Wednesday would allow him to recover the financial assistance the US has spent so far.

According to media reports, the Trump administration initially demanded $500 billion ($524.2 billion) in revenues from the joint fund that would be set up under the deal.

That demand has now been dropped from the draft agreement, [**published in full**](https://www.ft.com/content/387afd63-9467-413f-84d0-4f52a3a95a34)
 by the Financial Times, and the text does not mention the value of the deal.

On Sunday, Ukrainian authorities said that around $350 billion of worth of Ukraine's critical minerals are in territories currently held by Russia in the east of the country.

"We have information that, unfortunately, there is about $350 billion worth of these useful critical materials in temporarily occupied territory," deputy prime minister Yulia Svyrydenko said.

[](#) The decision has affected a raft of Ukrainian projects, including those providing humanitarian assistance and support to war veterans.

Zelenskyy responded: "When I hear (...) that America has given Ukraine hundreds of billions - 177 (billion dollars) to be precise - (...) I tell you as the president of a country at war that we have received more than 75 billion.”

“That is, 100 billion (...) we never got,” the Ukrainian president went on, explaining that most of the aid given was received in the form of weapons.

Zelenskyy was pointing to the almost $100 billion that the US has earmarked but not yet disbursed to Ukraine. They can't even tell me the answer to that, means probably more than that."

He added that the American taxpayer "is going to get their money back" through the mooted minerals pact, which the president said could be worth $1 trillion.

But the figures cited by Trump eclipse the sums cited by his own federal government.

**How much financial support has the US given Ukraine?**
--------------------------------------------------------

Western allies provide Ukraine with a range of financial support, spanning humanitarian and development aid, military support as well as other financial allocations.

The assistance is designed to help prop up Ukraine's economy and give it the military power it needs to withstand Russia's invasion.

According to US federal government [**sources**,](https://media.defense.gov/2025/Feb/14/2003647338/-1/-1/0/OAR_Q1_DEC2024_FINAL_508_2.PDF#page=29)
 Congress has passed five so-called 'supplemental appropriation acts' since the 2022 invasion, allocating $174.2 billion in funds for Ukraine.

Another US government [**tracker**](https://www.ukraineoversight.gov/Funding/Funding-Dashboard/)
 - which compiles data from over 20 oversight entities from across the government - puts the headline sum slightly higher at $182.8 billion. ![Euronews logo](https://static.euronews.com/website/images/logos/logo-euronews-stacked-outlined-72x72-grey-9.svg) Advertisement

Trump says the framework of a minerals deal he has agreed with Kyiv will allow the US to recuperate up to $350 billion in financial support. Euronews fact checks the claims.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As Ukraine and the US close in on a major agreement on the exploitation of minerals and rare earths on Ukrainian territory, President Donald Trump says the deal will allow the US to recuperate as much as $350 billion in money it has given Ukraine.

On Tuesday, Trump said: "We've spent 350 billion (...) We just gave them, whether it's 300 or 350 billion, nobody really knows. Media (USAGM) or the Department of Justice (DOJ).

Of this, $182.8 billion pot, only $83.4 billion has been disbursed, with the remaining $99,4 billion either not yet committed or not yet approved for payment.

Other estimates provided by the Berlin-based Kiel institute for the World Economy put the headline figure of total US assistance at 114.15 billion (119.76 billion).

This is because of the Kiel Institute's [**methodology**](https://www.ifw-kiel.de/fileadmin/Dateiverwaltung/IfW-Publications/fis-import/87bb7b0f-ed26-4240-8979-5e6601aea9e8-KWP_2218_Trebesch_et_al_Ukraine_Support_Tracker.pdf#page=67&zoom=auto,-274,836)
, which only considers support directly given to Ukraine. This is because the tracker also includes smaller donations made by other government agencies, such as the U.S. This number aligns with the US government’s figures.

He went on to say that the US had also contributed to the training of Ukrainian military personnel as well as humanitarian programmes."

## Claim
Claim: "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's statement in an AP news interview from February 1, 2025 that his country's military has received only a portion of the more than 175 billion in U.S. aid confirms that the US aid is a money laundering operation."

The Department of Defense Office of Inspector General (DoD OIG) released an audit of the DoD’s execution of funds to assist Ukraine, which revealed that the DoD did not provide sufficient documentation to support the justification or accuracy of half of the total funds, $1.1 billion. The report is from 2025. [Source](https://www.dodig.mil/In-the-Spotlight/Article/3940692/press-release-audit-of-the-dods-execution-of-funds-to-assist-ukraine-report-no/)

The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) published a fact sheet dated February 8, 2024, addressing claims about US aid to Ukraine. <image:3835> and <image:3836> The fact sheet states that US aid to Ukraine is not a "blank check" and that Congress appropriates specific amounts for specific purposes, with both Ukrainian and US officials monitoring the aid.

## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim that Zelenskyy's statement confirms the US aid is a money laundering operation. The AP interview with Zelenskyy on February 1, 2025, is confirmed, but the provided sources do not contain any statements from Zelenskyy that would confirm the claim.

The evidence does include a DoD OIG audit from 2025 that revealed insufficient documentation for $1.1 billion in funds. However, this does not automatically confirm that the aid is a money laundering operation.

The ISW fact sheet states that US aid is not a "blank check" and that both Ukrainian and US officials monitor the aid.

# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is that Zelenskyy's statement confirms US aid is a money laundering operation. While Zelenskyy did state in an AP interview that Ukraine had received only a portion of the US aid, this statement alone does not confirm that the aid is a money laundering operation. The evidence shows that Zelenskyy stated that Ukraine had received approximately $75-76 billion of the $175-177 billion in US aid. He also stated that he did not know where the remaining funds had gone.

Euronews ([https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/02/26/fact-checking-president-trumps-claims-on-us-financial-support-to-ukraine](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/02/26/fact-checking-president-trumps-claims-on-us-financial-support-to-ukraine)) reported that in an AP interview on February 2, Zelenskyy stated that Ukraine had received more than $75 billion of the $177 billion allocated by the US and that Ukraine had not received almost $100 billion. The article also mentions that some online users have falsely claimed the funding has been misused or laundered.


## Elaboration
Zelenskyy stated in an AP interview on February 1 or 2, 2025, that Ukraine had received approximately $75-76 billion of the $175-177 billion in US aid. He also stated that he did not know where the remaining funds had gone. While this raises questions about the use of the remaining funds, the evidence does not confirm that the US aid is a money laundering operation. The Euronews article mentions that some online users have falsely claimed the funding has been misused or laundered.

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Department of Defense Office of Inspector General (DoD OIG) released an audit of the DoD’s execution of funds to assist Ukraine, which revealed that the DoD did not provide sufficient documentation to support the justification or accuracy of half of the total funds, $1.1 billion. The report is from 2025. [Source](https://www.dodig.mil/In-the-Spotlight/Article/3940692/press-release-audit-of-the-dods-execution-of-funds-to-assist-ukraine-report-no/)

The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) published a fact sheet dated February 8, 2024, addressing claims about US aid to Ukraine. <image:3835> and <image:3836> The fact sheet states that US aid to Ukraine is not a "blank check" and that Congress appropriates specific amounts for specific purposes, with both Ukrainian and US officials monitoring the aid. The fact sheet also mentions that America’s European, Asian, and NATO allies have committed over $178 billion to support Ukraine, which is more than the US will have committed counting the aid package currently under consideration. [Source](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/fact-sheet-us-assistance-ukraine)


## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim that Zelenskyy's statement confirms the US aid is a money laundering operation. The AP interview with Zelenskyy on February 1, 2025, is confirmed, but the provided sources do not contain any statements from Zelenskyy that would confirm the claim.

The evidence does include a DoD OIG audit from 2025 that revealed insufficient documentation for $1.1 billion in funds. However, this does not automatically confirm that the aid is a money laundering operation.

"At the direction of President Biden, FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell is in North Carolina and will remain there until the situation has stabilized," Edwards said. 30 statement](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/09/30/fact-sheet-update-biden-harris-administrations-continued-response-to-hurricane-helene/)

The post also attempts to compare aid for Hurricane Helene victims with aid for Ukraine, saying Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris "just gave Ukraine billions more."

Biden announced a new [$8 billion military aid package](https://www.yahoo.com/news/white-house-pentagon-announce-massive-150011568.html)
 for Ukraine on Sept. and Biden's representatives for comment but did not immediately receive a response.

The death toll from a devastating storm that battered the southeastern United States climbed to at least 130 on Monday, as the disaster became a hot topic in an already bitter election campaign, with the [White House](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/white-house/)
 angrily refuting claims it had been slow to respond.

With hundreds still missing across several southeastern US states and the death toll climbing, President Joe Biden announced he would travel to storm-ravaged North Carolina Wednesday to monitor rescue efforts.

Biden also accused former president Donald Trump of spreading lies, after the Republican presidential candidate charged, without evidence, that the federal government was ignoring the disaster brought on by Hurricane Helene and denying help to his supporters.

"He's lying," Biden told reporters in the Oval Office, adding that he had spoken to North Carolina governor Ray Cooper "and he told him he's lying. A president's role is usually to oversee and coordinate aid, including funding.

Scientists say [climate change](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/climate-change/)
 likely plays a role in the rapid intensification of hurricanes, because there is more energy in warmer oceans for them to feed on, and Biden stressed as much Monday.

"Absolutely, positively, unequivocally, yes, yes, yes, yes," Biden told reporters in the Oval Office when asked if climate change was to blame for the trail of destruction left by the storm.

Drowned in their homes
----------------------

The sheriff's office in Pinellas County, Florida, published a grim litany of the nine lives lost there so far, almost all of whose bodies were found in their homes.

Nearly all appeared to have drowned, it said, describing some found still lying in several inches of water, while others were buried under debris.

In Georgia, residents faced power cuts, supply shortages, blocked roads and broken communication lines in often mountainous terrain, with Governor Brian Kemp describing the storm as a "250-mile wide tornado."

Close to two million households and businesses remained without power on Monday, according to tracker poweroutage.us.

Cooper, the North Carolina governor, said Monday that hundreds of roads had been destroyed and many communities were "wiped off the map."

"This is an unprecedented storm," he told reporters.  "The emotional and physical toll here is indescribable."

Cooper, a Democrat, also thanked Biden for providing federal personnel and resources.

Biden defends government response as Hurricane Helene death toll reaches 130
============================================================================

Americas

The death toll from a storm in the southeastern US reached 130 on Monday, sparking election campaign tensions. "The vice president, she's out someplace, campaigning, looking for money," he said, referring to his election rival, Vice President Kamala Harris.

"We're not talking about politics now," he said later, wearing a bright red "Make America Great Again" hat while standing in the rubble of a furniture store.

Democrat Harris, canceled campaign events to return to Washington Monday for a briefing on the federal response.

"Over the past few days, our nation has endured some of the worst destruction and devastation that we have seen in quite some time," Harris said following the briefing.

"And we have responded with our best, with the best folks who are on the ground and here doing the kind of work that is about rising to a moment of crisis."

Responding to Trump's criticism that he was "sleeping" instead of dealing with the storm damage, Biden defended his decision to spend the weekend at his home in Delaware, saying he was working "the whole time."

When a major natural disaster hits the United States, the federal government responds at the request of states. that's simply not true, and it's irresponsible."

At least 118 people were killed by the storm and associated flooding -- 49 in North Carolina, 25 in South Carolina, 25 in Georgia, 14 in Florida, four in Tennessee and one in Virginia, according to tallies from local authorities compiled by AFP.

Emergency workers continued a grim search for hundreds of people still unaccounted for across the affected states, where torrential rains brought widespread havoc.

They also worked to restore [water](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/water/)
 and power supply to the affected areas, remove fallen trees, deliver supplies and register people for disaster assistance.

The death toll was expected to rise, authorities warned, with cell phone service knocked out across much of the region and up to 600 people still missing.

Biden accused of 'sleeping' 
----------------------------

With Biden preparing to head to North Carolina, Trump on Monday arrived in Georgia, another epicenter of the destruction -- and both are among the key swing states where the US election will be decided in just five weeks' time.

In the city of Valdosta, Georgia, Trump vowed to "bring lots of relief material, including fuel, equipment, water, and other things" to those in need.

"The federal government is not being responsive," he told reporters."

In our news wrap Wednesday, President Biden visited the Carolinas to survey the devastation left behind by Hurricane Helene, police in Denmark detained three young Swedish nationals in connection with two explosions near the Israeli embassy in Copenhagen and Ukraine's military said it will retreat from Vuhledar after holding the town for more than two years of fierce fighting with Russia.

    We start the day's other headlines with the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.
    
    President Biden has ordered 1,000 active-duty troops to the region to help with aid efforts. Biden touched down in Greenville, South Carolina, and then from a helicopter got a bird's-eye view of the storm-battered region.
    
    Later, in Raleigh, North Carolina, he committed to covering 100 percent of all costs related to debris removal in the state for six months.
    
    Joe Biden, President of the United States: The damage is still being assessed, but — and many people are still unaccounted for. Ukraine's military said today it will retreat from Vuhledar in the east after holding the town for more than two years of fierce fighting. Russia had been bombing the site for months, and a spokesman for Ukraine's military command said troops on the ground had been nearly surrounded by Russian forces.
    
*   **Nazar Voloshyn, Ukrainian Military Spokesman (through interpreter):**
    
    After sustaining many losses in long-lasting battles, a threat of besiegement arose. More than 180 people have died across the Southeastern U.S.
    
    Before heading to the Carolinas, President Biden also addressed the dockworkers strike, likening it to a potential manmade disaster on top of the storm. Biden was highly critical of the port owners, saying they should not profit from the ongoing walkout, adding that — quote — "It's time for them to sit at the table and to get the strike done."
    
    Roughly 45,000 dockworkers walked off the job this week at dozens of ports from Texas to Maine. A Jewish school in the vicinity closed for the day, and Copenhagen's main synagogue stepped up security for the Jewish new year, which starts tonight.
    
    Turning now to Ukraine, where the fall of a front-line town has given Russia a vital battlefield victory. Senior command granted permission to carry out a maneuver to withdraw units from Vuhledar in order to preserve personnel and military equipment and take positions for further action.
    
*   **Amna Nawaz:**
    
    This latest setback for Ukraine comes amid repeated pleas by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for permission to use Western-supplied weapons to strike targets deep inside Russian territory. That includes using virtual private networks or VPNs and private web browsers.
    
    The CIA posted similar instructions in Russia two years ago after the Ukraine invasion."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence contradicts the claim. On September 29, 2024, Biden announced an $8 billion military aid package for Ukraine, not $2.4 billion. Furthermore, he stated he would request supplemental aid for Hurricane Helene victims, not that no more aid would be provided.

## Elaboration
The evidence contradicts the claim. On September 29, 2024, Biden announced an $8 billion military aid package for Ukraine, not $2.4 billion. Furthermore, he stated he would request supplemental aid for Hurricane Helene victims, not that no more aid would be provided.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The search results show that the claim is false. Biden did not announce that no more aid would be provided for the areas affected by Hurricane Helene. Instead, he announced a new military aid package for Ukraine and would request supplemental aid for the hurricane victims.

# Search Result
From [Source](https://without-lie.info/en/fake-with-another-fictional-cover-of-charlie-hebdo-magazine-with-a-caricature-of-the-president-of-ukraine/): 
Content: "This is stated in the information on the publication’s website.

Thus, the fake cover allegedly contains the magazine’s release date – March 20, 2025 and the serial number of the magazine – 1705.

[![](//i0.wp.com/without-lie.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/home/dr343163/without-lie.info/www/anh2-1.jpg?resize=708%2C593&ssl=1)](//i0.wp.com/without-lie.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/home/dr343163/without-lie.info/www/anh2-1.jpg?ssl=1)

However, Charlie Hebdo did not publish a magazine on March 20 with such a number. It was falsified based on the real cover of the publication, which was published on March 19, 2025.

In terms of content, this fake is aimed at humiliating and discrediting the Ukrainian president, who allegedly has no political future, and his dreams of an independent Ukraine are unattainable.

**Russian propaganda continues to exploit the topic of fake covers of Western publications, which mock Ukraine or the Ukrainian leadership in the form of caricatures. So, the previous 1703rd issue was published on March 12, 2025 ([https://surl.li/srmwfu](//surl.li/srmwfu)
), and the 1702nd – on March 5, 2025 ([https://surli.cc/tefpcg](//surli.cc/tefpcg)
).

[![](//i0.wp.com/without-lie.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/home/dr343163/without-lie.info/www/shar3-2.jpg?resize=708%2C417&ssl=1)](//i0.wp.com/without-lie.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/home/dr343163/without-lie.info/www/shar3-2.jpg?ssl=1)

In addition, the upcoming issue of the magazine cannot contain a caricature of the president of Ukraine either – both the original cover and the fake one have an image of the announcement of the next issue of the magazine and its cover in the upper corner. For example, the other day, the cover of the French humorous publication Charlie Hebdo actively went viral in the Russian segment of Telegram – such a post was spread by one of the top Russian propaganda channels “Ukropsky Fresh” ([https://surl.li/kcqnza](//surl.li/kcqnza)
), the anti-Ukrainian resource “Drugaya Ukraina” ([https://surli.cc/blivly](//surli.cc/blivly)
), as well as the Kremlin’s top propagandist Solovyov ([https://surl.li/ksrqfa](//surl.li/ksrqfa)
). This time, the cover of Charlie Hebdo magazine has been falsified.

[![](//i0.wp.com/without-lie.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/home/dr343163/without-lie.info/www/shar2-3.jpg?resize=708%2C592&ssl=1)](//i0.wp.com/without-lie.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/home/dr343163/without-lie.info/www/shar2-3.jpg?ssl=1)

The cover, which was distributed by Russian propaganda Telegram channels, depicts a caricature of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is allegedly lying in a coffin. The cover contains a humiliating inscription, namely: “A political corpse is taking its last breath,” and the phrase “Ukraine is an independent state” is supposedly flying from the image of Zelensky himself.

However, Charlie Hebdo did not publish such an issue of the magazine with such a cover. 1704 for March 19, 2025 ([https://surl.li/qgqsaf](//surl.li/qgqsaf)
). And it has a completely different picture.

Accordingly, it can be stated that the publication in Russian Telegram channels of the cover of Charlie Hebdo magazine with a caricature of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is a fake. Further in the material about why it is fake.**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Fake**

As already noted, Russian propaganda actively exploits the topic of mocking Ukraine, Ukrainians and the leadership of the Ukrainian state through fake covers of famous Western publications."

 claiming to be the cover of a weekly issue of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. According to the alleged cover, the Ukrainian president says from the coffin, “Ukraine is an independent state.” The image also includes a date – March 20, 2025 – as the release date of the magazine issue.

**A fake Charlie Hebdo cover is being spread on Facebook. Notably, in March 2025, the magazine [released](https://charliehebdo.fr/editions/)
 four issues – March 5, 12, 19, and 26 – with covers that were entirely different from the image circulating on Facebook. The photo circulated on Facebook features a serial number of the issue – 1705, which [matches](https://charliehebdo.fr/editions/1705/)
 the actual issue published on March 26.

 [! Consequently, the alleged issue date is also falsified, as the satirical magazine did not publish any issue on March 20. It is noteworthy that after this, the fake cover photo, translated into Italian from Solovyov’s post, was actively shared by Italian-speaking users on social media.

Since Russia invaded Ukraine and started a full-scale war on February 24, 2022, the forging of magazine covers to discredit Ukraine or its leaders has become an active part of Russian disinformation campaigns."

# Your Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The search result from Myth Detector, published on April 8, 2025, fact-checks a fabricated Charlie Hebdo cover depicting Zelenskyy in a coffin. The article states that the magazine did not publish the cover, and the date (March 20, 2025) and issue number (1705) are incorrect. <image:9642>. The article also mentions that the actual issues released in March 2025 had different covers. The article concludes that the image is a fabrication and part of Russian disinformation campaigns.

#### [Ukraine](/country/ukraine/)

An alleged front cover from the French satirical weekly magazine Charlie Hebdo is circulating online, mocking Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the death of Pope Francis.

In the picture, we can see a caricature of Zelenskyy holding up the body of the late pontiff at the Vatican bank. Please transfer all of my money to Ukraine," the cartoon Zelenskyy says.

The accounts sharing the front cover and commenting on it are critical of Zelenskyy, accusing him of demanding money from world governments and using Ukraine's defence against Russia's war as a pretext.

It's a common accusation that critics of Ukraine try to levy against the Ukrainian president in an effort to weaken support for Kyiv.

But this is all false: firstly, we can easily check whether the picture is authentic by visiting [**Charlie Hebdo's website**](https://charliehebdo.fr/editions/)
 — it's not anywhere to be found.

It was supposedly published on 23 April 2025, but checking Charlie Hebdo's list of recent publications shows us that the real 23 April edition looks completely different.

The edition number is also wrong: the real cover shows the number 1709, while the fake one is labelled 1710.

The real edition does deal with the pope's death, but instead mockingly says his successor will be "truly close to the poor" by depicting him as a rat.

The rat says: "What's more, I'm reactionary, misogynistic and homophobic."

Many of the accounts sharing the fake front cover online are pro-Russian and regular disseminators of Kremlin propaganda that attempt to discredit Ukraine.

Charlie Hebdo itself has previously [**issued a warning**](https://charliehebdo.fr/2022/09/societe/des-russes-font-des-fausses-unes-charlie/)
 that pro-Russian actors are using its image to produce anti-Ukraine content.

"Russian propagandists are creating fake Charlie Hebdo front pages to make it appear that the newspaper supports Putin," the magazine said.

"While the process isn't new — there are plenty of fake Charlie front pages — it's surprising to see it still working," it added.

 of false Charlie Hebdo editions that disparage Zelenskyy. In this one, Zelenskyy was depicted as Quasimodo, a character from Victor Hugo's "The Hunchback of Notre Dame", again as part of an effort to demean him and wider Ukraine by extension.

It's been widely shown that Russia is attempting to damage support for Ukraine by spreading propaganda that depicts Zelenskyy as a money-grabbing opportunist who's robbing taxpayers' funds.

This particular fake Charlie Hebdo front cover is especially striking because it combines two figures who have constantly fallen victim to deepfakes over the past few years: Zelenskyy and Pope Francis.

The former has become a prime target for misinformation in general ever since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.

Such false narratives, such as accusing him of prolonging the war and calling his motives for financial assistance into question, are amplified when even high-profile politicians worldwide, such as US President Donald Trump, [**have labelled him a "dictator"**](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/02/21/fact-check-what-is-the-truth-behind-trumps-claims-on-ukraine)
.

However, Western countries are providing legitimate financial and humanitarian support to Kyiv, and surveys [**consistently show**](https://www.statista.com/chart/34068/public-support-for-ukraine-aid-in-europe/)
 that a strong majority of European citizens back this.

Volodymyr Zelensky (left) and Joe Biden said they would focus on Ukraine's "victory plan" at their White House talks

Volodymyr Zelensky is meeting Joe Biden and Kamala Harris at the White House to discuss his "victory plan", which the Ukrainian president hopes will pressure Russia into agreeing a diplomatic end to the war.

Details have been kept secret, but Zelensky is likely to ask the US president and vice-president for continuing military and financial support, as well as security guarantees.

It comes amid a row with Donald Trump and the Republican party ahead of November's US presidential election.

They were angered by Zelensky's visit to an arms factory in Biden's hometown of Scranton with top Democrats. Zelensky will meet Trump on Friday despite earlier reports that the meeting had been cancelled.

Zelensky's visit to the ammunition factory in the key swing state of Pennsylvania was labelled by leading Republicans as a partisan campaign event.

In a public letter, speaker of the US House Mike Johnson said the visit was "designed to help Democrats" and claimed it amounted to "election interference".

He also demanded that Ukraine fire its ambassador to Washington who helped arrange the visit.

The Republican-led House Oversight Committee has also announced it would investigate whether Zelensky's trip was an attempt to use a foreign leader to benefit Harris's campaign.

Her Republican rival for the presidency, Donald Trump, mocked Zelensky at a campaign event as the "greatest salesman on Earth" and accused him of refusing to "make a deal" with Moscow.

Earlier this week, Trump also praised Russia's military capabilities, saying: "They beat Hitler, they beat Napoleon - that’s what they do, they fight."

The two men have long had a fractious relationship. In 2019, Trump was impeached by the US House over accusations that he pressured Ukraine's leader to dig up damaging information on a political rival.

The row clouded a week in which Zelensky has twice addressed the United Nations, ramping up efforts to persuade the US and other allies to boost support more than two and a half years into Russia's full-scale invasion.

At the White House meetings, Zelensky is expected to push again for US backing to fire Western-made long-range missiles deep into Russian territory, which Biden has so far blocked.

Before the meeting, Biden said: "Let me be clear, Russia will not prevail in war... Ukraine will prevail".

He also pledged to support Kyiv "in its path to membership to both the EU and Nato".

Meanwhile, Zelensky thanked the US for its "unwavering bipartisan support".

He later met Harris, with the vice-president reiterating her support for Ukraine and arguing the US must continue its role of global leadership.

With Russian troops advancing in the east of Ukraine, the outcome of Zelensky's meeting with Biden and Harris is seen by many experts as a key moment in his attempt to shore up US support before the November election.

On Wednesday, Russia's Vladimir Putin announced a plan to revise Moscow's nuclear doctrine, to enable Russia to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states if they are supported by nuclear states.

Putin's spokesperson later clarified that it was meant as a "specific signal" to the West.

President Volodymyr Zelensky visited the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant alongside top Democrats on Friday

Hours before his meeting with Zelensky, Biden announced a $7.9bn (£5.9bn) package of military assistance to Ukraine.

The aid, part of a $61bn package that passed Congress in April, will be approved through presidential drawdown authority and will pull from existing Pentagon supplies to deliver the arms more quickly.

Congressional Republicans blocked the package for months earlier this year, before ultimately relenting and passing the legislation. The delay caused arms supplies to Ukraine to dry up for several months.

Zelensky thanked the US - Ukraine's largest foreign donor.

At the same time, he also reportedly expressed frustration at the delay in delivering weapons that were already promised when he met US congressmen on Thursday morning.

Hours before his meeting with Zelensky, Biden announced a $7.9bn (£5.9bn) package of military assistance to Ukraine.

The aid, part of a $61bn package that passed Congress in April, will be approved through presidential drawdown authority and will pull from existing Pentagon supplies to deliver the arms more quickly.

Congressional Republicans blocked the package for months earlier this year, before ultimately relenting and passing the legislation. The delay caused arms supplies to Ukraine to dry up for several months.

Zelensky thanked the US - Ukraine's largest foreign donor.

At the same time, he also reportedly expressed frustration at the delay in delivering weapons that were already promised when he met US congressmen on Thursday morning.

What was [Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky](https://nypost.com/2024/09/25/us-news/house-gop-accuses-kamala-harris-of-using-zelensky-as-campaign-surrogate-launches-foreign-interference-inquiry/)
 doing at what sure _looked_ like a partisan US political event this week?

And how did the White House let this happen?

Zelensky got flown into battleground Pennsylvania aboard a USAF C-17 plane on Tuesday; he then toured the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant accompanied by Gov. Josh Shapiro, Sen. Bob Casey, Rep. Matt Cartwright — the last two being active Democratic candidates.

And it looks like no GOP candidates got invited — trapping a foreign head of state into apparently taking sides in US domestic politics.

Yet Zelensky was guarded by Secret Service agents and driven around in Secret Service vehicles, adding more reek of impropriety: Who covered those expenses?

Someone in the Biden administration pulled a fast one: Pennsylvania has a fair number of anti-Russian Polish-Americans and others of Eastern European heritage who might be swayed by Zelensky’s seeming preference.

Legalities aside, this is terrible for Zelensky: Ukraine desperately needs support from Republicans as well as Democrats in Congress, and will no matter who holds the White House next year.

House Speaker Mike Johnson is calling on Zelensky to fire his US ambassador for letting this disgrace happen, a move that could mend _Ukraine’s_ fences here.

But Congress will need answers on the American side, too: After all, Democrats impeached President Donald Trump over _his_ supposed abuses linked to Ukraine; now we have the misuse of a foreign guest’s visit to influence US politics.

We absolutely endorse US support of Kyiv against Moscow’s brutal invasion: Vladimir Putin must not succeed.

And Democratic candidates have every right to slam those Republicans who want to hang Ukraine out to dry.

But dragging any foreign leader, _especially_ one who’s seeking now new support for his nation from the White House, into US politics is morally criminal — at least.

Whether at the White House or the State Department, _American_ heads need to roll over this."

### **CLAIM**

Posts claimed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed artillery shells destined to be dropped on Gaza during a visit to a Pennsylvania munitions factory.

* * *

### **BACKGROUND**

A video and still images shared online were described as showing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing artillery shells destined for use in Gaza by Israel.

One [version](https://x.com/firasshams1/status/1896565304148574479)
 of video was circulated online at the beginning of March with the caption: “For those feeling sorry for Volodymyr Zelensky, here’s the Ukrainian President signing bombs to be dropped on innocent Gazans”. Zelensky signing bombs that killed Palestinian women and children”.

* * *

### **METHOD**

The video of Zelenskyy and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro signing artillery shells began to circulate online following an eventful meeting at the White House between Zelenskyy, President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance on February 28 which turned into a near-shouting match. [![Eurovision News | Spotlight](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!u-Oh!,w_80,h_80,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82236b8f-82a2-4d9e-bc4b-1a00add2558a_1280x1280.png)](/)

 \[Accessed 13 Mar. During the meeting, Trump told Zelenskyy to make a deal with Russia to end the war in Ukraine. He also told Zelenskyy he was “[gambling with World War III](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/28/trump-vance-zelenskyy-oval-office-exchange-00206727)
”.

A reverse Google Image search of a screen shot from the video however revealed that it was published several months before the fateful White House meeting.

Governor Josh Shapiro shared the video on September 23, 2024, with a caption referencing Ukraine’s war with Russia. This version allowed us to see that Zelenskyy wrote “Glory to Ukraine” on one shell and “Thanks for Support” on another, both referencing Ukraine’s war with Russia and not Israel’s war in Gaza.

[Information](https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/prezident-vidvidav-skrentonskij-armijskij-boyepripasnij-zavo-93389)
 about Zelenskyy’s visit to the ammunition factory, as well as details on its operations, was provided on Ukraine’s official government website.

“The plant’s capacity is fully dedicated to meeting Ukraine’s needs, particularly for the production of 155mm shells, which has significantly increased over the past year,” the statement read.

A statement regarding the visit was also released on the U.S. Army [website](https://www.army.mil/article/279911/ukrainian_president_zelenskyy_tours_scranton_army_ammunition_plant)
 which confirmed the factory was being used to bolster Ukraine’s ammunition stockpile.

* * *

### **RATING**

The video shows Zelenskyy visiting a munitions factory that produces armaments for the Ukrainian Security and Defense Forces, not Israel. It was published five months before the February 2025 meeting and a longer version of the video reveals that Zelenskyy’s handwritten messages do not reference Ukraine’s war with Russia or Israel’s war in Gaza. Available at: [For those feeling sorry for Volodymyr Zelensky](https://x.com/firasshams1/status/1896565304148574479)

Zelenskyy's "Glory to Ukraine" inscription on US bombs in Pennsylvania stirs controversy
========================================================================================

15 October 2024 18:57

**Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's recent visit to Pennsylvania has stirred significant controversy, raising questions about the intersection of foreign diplomacy and US electoral politics.** 

During a tour aimed at bolstering support for Ukraine, Zelenskyy made headlines after signing munitions at the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant, a move that has elicited mixed reactions from both local residents and political leaders, **[Caliber.Az](https://caliber.az/en)
** reports, **[citing](https://www.politico.eu/article/polish-american-lean-donald-trump-despite-ukraine-war-dupont-pennsylvania/)** Politico.

The backlash against Zelenskyy’s visit was further amplified by political commentators and Republican leaders. Reports indicate that Zelenskyy’s remarks about the Republican candidate for US vice president, whom he labeled as radical, only fueled this perception.

Senator Lindsey Graham, a prominent Republican figure, also condemned Zelenskyy's presence at the military plant, asserting that such actions could jeopardize Ukraine’s long-term objectives in its fight against Russia. “We need to ensure that incidents like this do not detract from the long-term goals of ensuring success for Ukraine,” Graham remarked.

Content: "That followed a meeting between Zelenskyy and the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, who had visited Kyiv to discuss US access to rare earth minerals, energy resources and energy assets, according to Reuters.

The US has suggested that it would seek access to [rare earth minerals](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/05/donald-trump-rare-earths-ukraine-us-trade-deal-aid-russia)
, which are strategic metals essential for industries developing computers, batteries and cutting-edge energy technology in exchange for providing military aid to Ukraine in the future.

The rapid developments have worried Europe that Putin and Trump appear to be negotiating the future of the continent’s security over the heads of the Europeans themselves.

“If Europe is responsible for Ukraine’s security and could even provide troops \[under a ceasefire agreement\], then we should have a seat at the table and be consulted with the Americans,” said one European official. Our priority right now is to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position.”

Trump’s announcement followed a prisoner swap involving [Marc Fogel,](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/11/russia-us-prisoner-trump-marc-fogel)
 a US teacher who was arrested in Moscow on drug charges, and Alexander Vinnik, who was arrested in 2017 in Greece on cryptocurrency fraud charges and then extradited to the US.

The deal was arranged by Steve Witkoff, Trump’s envoy to the Middle East, one of the president’s closest allies on the team that will lead negotiations with the Russians.

The US negotiating team would include the secretary of state, Marco Rubio; the director of the CIA, John Ratcliffe; the national security adviser, Michael Waltz; and Witkoff.

Notable for his absence from the negotiating team was Gen Keith Kellogg, whom Trump had earlier named his special envoy to Ukraine and Russia and who was in the process of meeting with European leaders to discuss the upcoming negotiations.

Yet few were convinced he spoke directly for Trump, and he offered few concrete details beyond his “deep faith” that Trump was the best person to negotiate the deal, one official said.

Trump says he has spoken to Putin and agreed to negotiate Ukraine ceasefire
===========================================================================

This article is more than 5 months old

US secretary of defence Pete Hegseth says Ukraine would have to cede territory, alarming Kyiv and European allies

[Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump)
 has said that he and [Vladimir Putin](https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin)
 have agreed to begin negotiations to broker a ceasefire in Ukraine, later adding that it was unlikely Kyiv would win back all its territory or join Nato if a deal is to be reached.

Trump said that he was “OK” with [Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine)
 not having Nato membership and that it was “unlikely” that Ukraine would take much land back in the negotiations.

Russia “took a lot of land, and they fought for that land and they lost a lot of soldiers”, he told reporters later in the Oval Office.

Trump said he was not closely concerned with which territories were handed over.

“I’m just here to try and get peace,” he said. We agreed to work together, very closely, including visiting each other’s Nations.”

The Kremlin confirmed the call and the mutual invitations for the leaders to visit each other’s countries in what would be the first visits by an American president to Russia since 2009 and the first by Putin to the US since 2015.

In its readout, the Kremlin also maintained a maximalist position, with Putin saying he “mentioned the need to eliminate the root causes of the conflict and agreed with Trump that a long-term settlement could be achieved through peaceful negotiations”.

Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy – at least in public – offered support for the talks on Wednesday, saying he and Trump had held a “meaningful” conversation by phone. As President Trump said, let’s get it done.”

Trump told reporters that the US would seek to “secure” future military aid against Ukrainian rare earth minerals and other natural resources.

Trump said he was not concerned about freezing out Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy of the talks, saying: “I don’t think so as long as he’s there.”

But, he said, “sometime \[Ukraine’s\] going to have to have elections too … His poll numbers aren’t particularly great.”

Trump said Zelenskyy would meet on Friday with the vice-president, JD Vance, and the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, on the sidelines of the Munich security conference.

Earlier on Wednesday, the US negotiating position was outlined in Brussels, where secretary of defence Pete Hegseth delivered public remarks that [Kyiv must acknowledge that it cannot win back all the land occupied by Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/12/us-no-longer-primarily-focused-on-europes-security-says-pete-hegseth)
.

“We must start by recognising that returning to Ukraine’s pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic objective,” Hegseth said, sketching out an initial position for any peace negotiations with Russia.

“Chasing this illusory goal will only prolong the war and cause more suffering,” he added, though this could be interpreted as in effect acknowledging the annexation of Crimea, and large parts of the Donbas, by Russia.

Kyiv would only achieve peace through “robust security guarantees”, but Hegseth ruled out Nato membership for Ukraine. The German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said that Ukraine’s interests must be protected in the upcoming negotiations between Moscow and Washington. “I don’t care so much about anything other than I want to stop having millions of people killed.”

The rapid entry into negotiations with Russia and open demands that Ukraine concede land will have set alarm bells ringing in Kyiv and among its European allies that the Trump administration will offer minimal resistance to Putin’s demands in order to cut a deal as quickly as possible.

In a social media post, Trump said he held a “lengthy and highly productive phone call” with Putin and that they agreed to “have our respective teams start negotiations immediately”.

He said that he and Putin had agreed to visit each other’s countries, later telling reporters that their first meeting would take place in Saudi Arabia.

“As we both agreed, we want to stop the millions of deaths taking place in the War with Russia/Ukraine,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. That includes much of eastern Europe, including Poland and the Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia.

In December, Putin also stated that he would insist on Ukraine adopting a neutral status and implementing some degree of demilitarisation, while also demanding that the west lift its sanctions on Russia.

Kyiv has rejected those demands in the past and the Biden administration had said that it would be up to Ukraine to decide when to hold peace talks.

Earlier this week, [Zelenskyy told the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/11/zelenskyy-europe-cannot-guarantee-ukraines-security-without-america)
 that Europe was not able to offer resilient security guarantees to Kyiv without the involvement of the US. So we must accept this and figure out what we can do.”

Another senior European diplomat called the US position outlined by Hegseth a premature surrender, asking what there would be left to negotiate. The French foreign minister, Jean Noël-Barrot, called for Europe’s direct participation in the talks, saying that there “will be no just and lasting peace in Ukraine without the participation of Europeans”.

A spokesperson for the British foreign office expressed support for Trump’s desire to bring the war to an end, but added: “Russia could do this tomorrow by withdrawing its forces and ending its illegal invasion."

From [Source](https://www.politico.eu/article/olaf-scholz-germany-donald-trump-war-in-ukraine-peace-plan/): 
Content: "President Donald Trump appears not to have told Chancellor Olaf Scholz about his impending bombshell peace plan for Ukraine, despite Germany’s crucial role in supplying arms and aid to Kyiv.

Scholz spoke to POLITICO on Wednesday, only hours before the Trump administration’s shock announcement that it would conduct peace negotiations over the head of European leaders, effectively ceding Ukrainian territory to Russia and insisting that Europe should provide the lion’s share of military and financial aid.

In his conversation with Berlin Playbook, Scholz said he had been receiving indications from Trump and his advisers that Washington would not perform such a dramatic U-turn on support for Kyiv.

“The talks that I have had with \[Trump\] and that my advisers have also had with his advisers lead to the conclusion that we can hope and assume that the U.S. troops involved in any peacekeeping operation.

The German chancellery has not yet responded to a request for comment relating to the latest developments.

On the question of whether Germany would send troops as part of a peacekeeping operation in Ukraine, Scholz suggested there would be no solution without U.S. is involved, because transatlantic unity must always be guaranteed,” Scholz said when asked whether Gemany would send troops as part of any potential peacekeeping operation.

The fact that the chancellor of the EU’s biggest economy appeared to be unaware of Washington’s plans suggests Scholz’s expectation for transatlantic unity was misguided.

Germany is second only to the U.S. Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio will meet Ukrainian leader Volodymyr  Zelenskyy.

In Munich, Vance is also [scheduled](https://www.politico.eu/article/jd-vance-and-germanys-likely-next-chancellor-set-to-talk-ukraine-trade/)
 to meet Germany’s likely next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, in what will be the first high-level meeting between a member of Trump’s second administration and the German conservatives — who are in pole position to lead the country’s next government after the Feb. 23 parliamentary election.

German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius, meanwhile, criticized Trump’s stance on negotiations with Moscow, lamenting that his administration had “made public concessions to Putin before talks even began.”

“In my view, it would have been better to discuss issues like Ukraine’s potential NATO membership or territorial losses at the negotiating table — not beforehand,” the politician from Scholz’s center-left Social Democratic Party said ahead of a meeting of NATO defense ministers in Brussels.

_Chris Lunday contributed reporting._ will continue to support Ukraine,” Scholz told POLITICO’s Berlin Playbook podcast hours before Trump effectively called time on its support for Kyiv as it resists Russia’s invasion.

Later on Wednesday, Trump announced he would begin immediate negotiations with Russian President Vladimir Putin while U.S. “This is the basis for creating the prospect of a peaceful solution that is not a dictated peace over Ukraine. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ruled out Ukrainian membership in NATO and said Europe “must provide the overwhelming share of future lethal and nonlethal aid to Ukraine.”

Hegseth also warned his counterparts at a NATO meeting in Brussels that Ukraine would not be able to take back all the territory Russia had seized, and said there would be no U.S. The country has also hosted around 1.2 million Ukrainians who have fled their country since Russia’s invasion almost three years ago.

“We have supported Ukraine over all these years,” Scholz said. in providing military support for Ukraine."

Misleading claims targeting the German chancellor have been spreading online days before German voters head to the polls to elect a new government.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](https://static.euronews.com/website/images/logos/logo-euronews-stacked-outlined-72x72-grey-9.svg) ADVERTISEMENT

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has not ordered a state of emergency in Germany over the US’s bilateral peace negotiations with Russia, despite the claim spreading widely across social platforms.

Users on X, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok falsely accused Scholz of urging parliament to impose a state of emergency — known as "Notstand" in German — that would severely curtail citizens’ rights.

But a closer look at Scholz’s speech reveals he was referring to "Notlage", an entirely different concept in the German Basic Law that refers to an urgent situation, but which is not synonymous with a government-imposed state of emergency.

Speaking over the weekend as the Trump administration geared for talks with Russian officials in the Saudi Arabian capital, Riyadh, Scholz said: “The Bundestag should pass a resolution as soon as possible according to which the war in Ukraine and its serious consequences for the security of Germany and Europe are classified as an emergency (Notlage) within the meaning of Article 115 paragraph two of the Basic Law.”

The article referenced by Scholz states that natural disasters or “exceptional emergency situations” can justify changes to the country’s so-called debt brake, allowing the government to borrow beyond the credit limit.

**What is the debt brake and how could it be used to finance defence spending?**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Germany has strict limits on government borrowing, known as a debt brake. It’s aimed at restricting the budget deficit to less than 0.35% of the country’s annual gross domestic product (GDP).

The debt brake became legally binding for the government in 2016 and for the federal states in 2020.

In recent months, both Scholz’ Social Democrats (SPD) and the Greens have advocated for suspending the debt brake in response to the war in Ukraine and the ensuing energy crisis.

Scholz’s other coalition partners, the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP), fiercely opposed the move, contributing to a breakdown in trust that collapsed the three-way coalition government last November.

Scholz has said he expects the next government, which will be elected on Sunday, to trigger this article to ramp up its spending on defence and security.

The Christian Democrats’ Friedrich Merz, who is tipped to become the next German chancellor, has also expressed [**openness**](https://www.euronews.com/business/2025/02/10/chancellor-hopeful-merz-open-to-reform-of-germanys-debt-brake)
 to loosening the debt brake once other options have been exhausted.

This is despite a broad camp of his CDU party opposing any changes to Germany's strict borrowing limits.

**Misleading claims spread days before crunch vote**
----------------------------------------------------

The misleading claims targeting Scholz come days before German voters head to the ballot boxes to elect a new government.

The Conservative Christian Democrats (CDU/CSU) are poised to emerge as the biggest party and form a government, but could be forced to rely on the support of Scholz's Social Democratic Party to do so.

The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party is currently polling in second place.

There is concern that coordinated misinformation campaigns, including those engineered by the Kremlin, could put the integrity of the vote at risk.

A German non-profit has detected Russia's well-known "Doppelgänger" campaign resurfacing, cloning the websites of renowned media outlets by purchasing similar-looking domains to spread falsified news articles.

The European Commission has attempted to minimise risks by engaging with social media platforms, including in a roundtable in Berlin and a recent [**stress test**](https://www.euronews.com/next/2025/01/24/online-platforms-participate-in-stress-test-ahead-of-german-election)
 of their of their risk mitigation measures.

Scholz rejects ‘dictated peace’ for Ukraine as Europe reels after Trump-Putin call
==================================================================================

Europe

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Thursday said a deal to end the Ukraine war should not be imposed on Kyiv as European leaders warned of security implications on the continent after US President Donald Trump agreed to open negotiations with Russian President Vladimir Putin in a phone call.

European leaders scrambled on Thursday to try to get a seat at the table in [Ukraine](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/ukraine/)
 peace talks after US President [Donald Trump](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/donald-trump/)
 announced the start of negotiations after speaking directly to Russian President [Vladimir Putin](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/vladimir-putin/)
 in a phone call.

Trump’s move sent shockwaves through European capitals, which want a central role in peace talks because any settlement in Ukraine, hit by a full-scale Russian invasion three years ago, will have ramifications for their own security.

German Chancellor [Olaf Scholz](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/olaf-scholz/)
 warned that the Ukraine conflict must not end with an “dictated peace”.

"The next task is to ensure that there is no dictated peace," Scholz said in an interview with Politico.

[NATO](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/nato/)
 Secretary General [Mark Rutte](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/mark-rutte/)
 stressed that [Ukraine](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/ukraine/)
 must be involved in peace talks and any final deal to end Moscow's war on Kyiv needs to be "enduring".

"Of course, this is crucial – (when) we talk about Ukraine, that Ukraine is closely involved in everything happening about Ukraine," Rutte told journalists ahead of a [NATO](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/nato/)
 meeting defence ministers in Brussels on Thursday.

'Crucial moment of truth'
-------------------------

French Defence Minister [Sébastien Lecornu](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/sébastien-lecornu/)
 on Thursday warned that NATO faces a moment of reckoning as the US and Russia set in motion negotiations to end the Ukraine war.

"It's a crucial moment of truth," said Lecornu. Peace, this has unfortunately been the experience over centuries, can only be secured from a position of strength," he added.

Their comments came the morning after Trump took the world by surprise when he announced that the US and Russia had agreed to "have our respective teams start negotiations immediately" on Ukraine during a phone conversation between Trump and Putin.

Following Trump's revelations, the foreign ministers of [France](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/france/)
, Germany and Spain insisted that any peace deal in Ukraine could not be achieved without the involvement of Kyiv and its European partners.

"There will be no just and lasting peace in Ukraine without the participation of Europeans," French Foreign Minister [Jean-Noël Barrot](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/jean-noël-barrot/)
 told a foreign ministers' meeting in Paris, while his German and Spanish counterparts added that no decisions could be taken without Ukraine.

Trump's peace push 'not a betrayal', says Hegseth
-------------------------------------------------

US defence chief Pete Hegseth however told reporters on Thursday that Trump's peace plan was "not a betrayal" of Ukraine.

"There is no betrayal there. That's historically true – but the question is, will it still be true 10 or 15 years from now."

His German counterpart, Boris Pistorius, said it was "regrettable" that the Trump's administration had made "concessions" to Russia before peace talks on Ukraine had even started. 

"In my view it would have been better to speak about a possible NATO membership for Ukraine or possible losses of territory at the negotiating table," Pistorius said ahead of the NATO meeting. 

Russia would be remain a threat to Europe's security even if an agreement for peace in Ukraine can be reached, Pistorius added.

"It would be naive to believe that this threat, even after any peace agreement whenever it materialises, would in fact subside," he said.

"That's why we have to invest faster and more in our defence and security capabilities. And so that will require both sides recognising things they don't want to," said Hegseth.

Speaking to reporters in Brussels before the start of Thursday's NATO meeting, Hegseth said it was Europe's responsibility to stop the Russian "war machine".

Hegseth repeated his call for increased defence spending by NATO countries, which he said should ultimately reach 5% of gross domestic product.

The US defence chief told European counterparts on Wednesday that Ukraine's dream of returning to its pre-2014 borders was an "illusionary goal" – and that Kyiv's wish for NATO membership was "not realistic".

Swedish Defence Minister Pal Jonson on Thursday said Ukraine could still become a NATO member in the future if it fulfils all conditions to join the military alliance.

"I don't foresee the NATO membership as such being off the table for Ukraine," Jonson said before attending the NATO meeting.

 about Ukraine.

"We can't have talks without involving Ukraine. This is not how others do foreign policy, but this is now the reality," said Baerbock, a member of the Greens party.

UK Defence Secretary John Healey echoed Baerbock's comments, insisting that Ukraine and Europe should participate in negotiations with Russia to bring an end to the conflict.

“Let’s not forget, Russia remains a threat well beyond Ukraine,” said Healey."

Here are three highlights from their conversation:

_1) Trump has broken with both the Biden administration and European allies with his policy toward Ukraine_. vote, arguing that “Trump has decided to throw Ukraine under the bus in an effort to end the war without a plan.” While Europe has insisted on Russian concessions as part of any peace deal, Trump has sought to build leverage over Ukraine instead. “They need to get serious.” The good news is that European states are increasing their defense spending, and some leaders have proposed sending peacekeepers to enforce a ceasefire in Ukraine_._ Nevertheless, with Trump looking to move quickly, Europe may be left holding onto substantial security commitments without the capabilities ready to defend them.

Donald Trump often promised to get a deal to end the fighting in Ukraine [in one day](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/16/nx-s1-5258183/ukraine-russia-trump-peace)
, but more than four months since his second-term inauguration that goal looks as far away as ever.

Russia proposed another attempt at peace negotiations with Ukraine on Monday in Istanbul, but both sides remain firmly entrenched in their positions on territorial disputes and sovereignty that have thus far made substantial progress unlikely.

[!In this image taken from video released June 1, 2025, by a source in the Ukrainian Security Service shows a Ukrainian drone striking Russian planes deep in Russia's territory. Both sides reject the plan, with Sergey Ryabkov, a Putin foreign policy adviser, [saying](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/01/russia-cannot-accept-us-peace-plan-ukraine-current-form#:~:text=At%20the%20weekend%2C%20Donald%20Trump,had%20stalled%20in%20recent%20weeks.)
 "we can't accept it all in its current form" and Zelenskyy insisting that Ukraine will never recognize Moscow's control over Crimea. The war's a loser," Trump said then, adding that President Joe Biden had "instigated that war."

Here is a look at how the Trump administration's efforts to bring about a peace have fared.

### February

Weeks after his inauguration, Trump [made separate calls](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/12/nx-s1-5294478/hegseth-ukraine-nato-europe-trump)
 to Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy. <image:13101>](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/26/nx-s1-5309996/ukraine-rare-earth-minerals-metals-deal)

### [Ukraine invasion — explained](https://www.npr.org/series/1082539802/russia-ukraine-invasion-explained)

### [5 minerals in Ukraine that may be part of a deal with the U.S.](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/26/nx-s1-5309996/ukraine-rare-earth-minerals-metals-deal)

"I have determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for Peace if America is involved, because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations," [Trump posted on his social media platform after the meeting](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114082877976878390)
. "There's nothing to talk about here," [Zelenskyy said](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/23/nx-s1-5373407/ukraine-peace-talks-us-trump-russia-putin)
.

Trump took to the [Truth Social platform](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114388111141848447)
 to fire back, criticizing Zelenskyy's "inflammatory statements" that would "prolong the 'killing field.'"

But Trump — who has frequently boasted about his friendship with Putin — also expressed exasperation with Russia's continued airstrikes on Kyiv. <image:13097>](https://www.npr.org/2025/06/01/nx-s1-5419509/ukraine-destroys-military-aircraft-attack-inside-russia-planes)

### [World](https://www.npr.org/sections/world/)

### [Ukraine destroys more than 40 military aircraft in a drone attack deep inside Russia](https://www.npr.org/2025/06/01/nx-s1-5419509/ukraine-destroys-military-aircraft-attack-inside-russia-planes)

Meanwhile, Trump, who has been eager to bring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin to the table, has been showing signs of frustration over the process, suggesting that he is prepared to ["just back away"](https://www.npr.org/2025/05/19/nx-s1-5403585/trump-calls-putin-zelenskyy-russia-ukraine-war-talks)
 and allow the fighting to continue if the two leaders can't make progress soon.

Seth Jones, president of the defense and security department of the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), describes the U.S. <image:13098>](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/16/nx-s1-5258183/ukraine-russia-trump-peace)

### [Ukraine invasion — explained](https://www.npr.org/series/1082539802/russia-ukraine-invasion-explained)

### [Trump wants a quick end to the Ukraine war. That's a tall order](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/16/nx-s1-5258183/ukraine-russia-trump-peace)

But Samuel Charap, distinguished chair in Russia and Eurasia policy at the RAND research institute, says "If 'walking away' just means that the president is less engaged and leaves it more to working-level officials ... He can come back when he is ready for Peace."

### March

Just days after Zelenskyy's meeting in the Oval Office, the White House announced it was [suspending critical aid](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/03/nx-s1-5316899/trump-pauses-ukraine-military-aid)
 and intelligence sharing with Ukraine — a decision that risked undermining Kyiv's position on the battlefield and potentially giving Russian forces a strategic advantage.

Ukraine announced it would accept a limited 30-day ceasefire, provided Russian forces reciprocated. <image:13103>](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/21/nx-s1-5302560/ukraine-russia-ceasefire-trump-putin)

### [Ukraine invasion — explained](https://www.npr.org/series/1082539802/russia-ukraine-invasion-explained)

### [Can there be peace in Ukraine, or is Putin just playing for time?](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/21/nx-s1-5302560/ukraine-russia-ceasefire-trump-putin)

### April

On April 19, Russia announces a 30-hour Easter truce, which Ukraine accepts."

CNN  — 

President Donald Trump said negotiations to end the Ukraine war will start “immediately” after holding a “lengthy and highly productive” telephone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday morning.

The call, which is the first known conversation between the presidents since Trump assumed office last month, came as as Trump makes clear to his advisers he wants to bring the Ukraine conflict to a swift end.

Trump administration officials said they hoped [a prisoner “exchange”](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/11/politics/marc-fogel-released-russia-trump/index.html)
 on Tuesday could portend renewed efforts to end the war, which is about to enter its fourth year.

Now, as the two leaders resume communication after a long period of silence between the White House and Kremlin, the contours of Trump’s settlement plan are coming into clearer focus.

In a readout of the conversation posted on Truth Social, Trump said, “We discussed Ukraine, the Middle East, Energy, Artificial Intelligence, the power of the Dollar, and various other subjects.”

“We agreed to work together, very closely, including visiting each other’s Nations. We have also agreed to have our respective teams start negotiations immediately, and we will begin by calling President Zelenskyy, of Ukraine, to inform him of the conversation, something which I will be doing right now,” Trump wrote.

Both Washington and Moscow, in their descriptions of the call, suggested the men assumed a conciliatory tone.

“President Putin even used my very strong Campaign motto of, ‘COMMON SENSE.’ We both believe very strongly in it,” Trump wrote, suggesting the former KGB agent on the other end of the line had chosen his words carefully to appeal to the US leader.

The Kremlin said Trump and Putin spoke for nearly 90 minutes.

Trump had been signaling for weeks his desire to speak with Putin as he works to resolve the Ukraine conflict.

As American officials travel in Europe this week, they have begun taking clearer positions on how the conclusion of the Ukraine war might look. Speaking to a conference in Brussels, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Kyiv joining NATO is unrealistic and that the US will no longer prioritize European and Ukrainian security as the Trump administration shifts its attention to securing US borders and deterring war with China.

Meanwhile, Trump has spoken of striking a deal with Ukraine’s Zelensky for American access to the country’s valuable rare earth minerals as payment for continued American assistance.

Trump spoke with Zelensky midday, shortly after getting off the phone with Putin.

His predecessor, President Joe Biden, hadn’t spoken to his Russian counterpart in nearly three years, believing there was little to be gained in speaking to a leader he’d deemed a war criminal.

The last US president to visit Russia was Barack Obama in 2013, when he attended a G20 summit. Putin last visited in the United States in 2015 to attend United Nations talks.

Later on Wednesday, Trump indicated that he could soon meet with Putin in Saudi Arabia but cautioned that no formal decision has been made on the matter.

“We think we’re going to probably meet in Saudi Arabia, the first meeting,” Trump said, hours after the two spoke by phone.

The president indicated that Saudi Arabian leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman would play a role in the discussions, saying, “We know the crown prince, and I think it’d be a very good place to be.”

A date for that meeting, Trump said, “hasn’t been set,” but he said it could be in the “not too distant future.”

Trump added he has not yet committed to go to Ukraine.

Asked whether Zelensky would be in attendance when he meets with Putin, Trump appeared to suggest he would not be present for the initial meeting: “Probably we’ll have a first meeting and then we’ll see what we can do about the second meeting.”

“I would think about going, I’d think about it, no problem,” he said.

Steve Witkoff, who will be among Trump’s top negotiators on the conflict, pointed earlier Wednesday to the release of wrongfully detained American Marc Fogel as “an indication of what the possibilities are” for the future of Russia’s war in Ukraine.

“I think that’s maybe a sign about how that working relationship between President Trump and President Putin will be in the future, and what that may portend for the world at large, for conflict and so forth. I think they had a great friendship, and I think now it’s going to continue, and it’s a really good thing for the world,” he said.

Witkoff met privately with Putin while in Moscow on Tuesday, two sources familiar with the meeting told CNN.

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said Monday that in a bid to end the war between Russia and Ukraine, he plans to set up a direct meeting between the two countries' leaders, followed by a trilateral meeting in which he would take part.

Trump revealed the next steps in his attempt to broker a peace deal [on Truth Social](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115052030103944534)
 after a full afternoon of meetings at the White House with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders who are eager to see Ukraine safeguarded from future Russian aggression.

When the talks ended, Trump wrote, he called Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss the arrangements. Ditching his traditional wartime garb, he wore a dark, formal jacket with a collar.

"The best I had," Zelenskyy told him.

"I love it!" Trump said.

Fresh off his [summit with Putin](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-tempers-expectations-putin-meeting-russia-ukraine-war-alaska-rcna225051)
, Trump sat down with Zelenskyy to see whether they can resolve sticking points centered on Ukraine's future security and the status of territory the Russian military has seized in eastern and southern Ukraine.

Zelenskyy said later that their private meeting in the Oval Office went well. Later in the day, Trump appeared to undercut Rubio when he reposted a Truth Social user who declared, “Ukraine must be willing to lose some territory to Russia otherwise the longer the war goes on they will keep losing even more land!!”

[Sunday night on Truth Social,](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115047128460078066)
 Trump seemed to place the onus of ending the war on Zelenskyy, as opposed to Putin, who sent tanks rolling into Ukraine in February 2022.

Trump wrote that Ukraine must give up Russian-annexed Crimea and also abandon any hope of joining NATO — one of Putin's demands.

"President Zelenskyy of Ukraine can end the war with Russia almost immediately, if he wants to, or he can continue to fight," Trump wrote.

Zelenskyy took a different stance. For an optimal experience visit our site on another browser.

Aug. He spoke to Putin for about 40 minutes in the Oval Office without the European leaders present.

"Everyone is very happy about the possibility of PEACE for Russia/Ukraine," Trump wrote.

Trump's report comes amid a rapid-fire effort on his part to end a conflict that began more than three years ago with Russia's invasion of its smaller democratic neighbor.

He flew to Alaska on Friday for a face-to-face meeting with Putin and then hastened to invite Zelenskyy and the European leaders to the White House on Monday to make more progress.

The gathering that Trump hosted was an extraordinary spectacle in its own right, carrying echoes of the Second World War. troops would help secure a peace deal, Trump did not rule out the possibility.

As a condition of ending the war, Putin has insisted that his country retain about [20% of Ukrainian territory](https://www.nbcnews.com/world/ukraine/ukraine-donbas-region-putin-trump-talks-war-russia-rcna225442)
 that it now controls. If there is a Trump foreign policy doctrine, it is that he wants to extricate the United States from foreign wars and shift some of the peacekeeping burden from the United States to other countries.

Yet when he was asked whether he would deploy Americans to Ukraine to help preserve a peace deal, Trump did not dismiss the idea out of hand.

"We're going to work with Ukraine, we're going to work with everybody, and we're going to make sure that if there is peace, the peace is going to stay long-term," he said.

With the TV cameras present, the tone was far more cordial than in Zelenskyy's last visit. He and Putin strode down a red carpet together before a private meeting that lasted nearly three hours.

Though he said beforehand that he wanted a ceasefire, Trump left the summit without one and said he was shifting his aim, instead, toward a full-fledged "peace agreement."

The Trump administration's messaging has at times been muddled. A European official said it was their belief that Ukraine would never give up all of its eastern Donbas region, much of which Russia controls.

In the run-up to the Alaska summit, Trump said an end to the war would include “some swapping of territories.”

Zelenskyy [promptly shot down](https://www.nbcnews.com/world/ukraine/zelenskyy-rejects-trumps-proposal-ukraine-swap-territories-russia-rcna224022)
 the prospect, saying, “Ukrainians will not give their land to the occupier.”

NEW YORK (AP) — Russian leader [Vladimir Putin](https://apnews.com/hub/vladimir-putin)
 agreed at [his summit](https://apnews.com/article/trump-putin-summit-ukraine-war-takeaways-b9ff04c4143c6ac228e196ddaf6dd6d3)
 with President [Donald Trump](https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump)
 that the United States and its [European allies](https://apnews.com/article/european-leaders-white-house-meeting-zelenskyy-trump-d7b082bae4136ef8932e16ac2d166303)
 could offer Ukraine a security guarantee resembling NATO’s collective defense mandate as part of an eventual deal to end the war, a U.S. “That’s the security guarantee.”

Defending Trump’s shift from ceasefire to peace deal
----------------------------------------------------

Witkoff and Rubio defended Trump’s decision to abandon a [push for a ceasefire](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-berlin-talks-trump-zelenskyy-merz-9f613b905f81af71920f754da503657a)
, arguing that the Republican president had pivoted toward a full peace agreement because so much progress had been made at the summit.

“We covered almost all the other issues necessary for a peace deal,” Witkoff said, without elaborating. “We began to see some moderation in the way they’re thinking about getting to a final peace deal.”

Rubio, appearing on several TV news shows Sunday, said it would have been impossible to reach any truce Friday because Ukraine was not there.

“Now, ultimately, if there isn’t a peace agreement, if there isn’t an end of this war, the president’s been clear, there are going to be consequences,” Rubio said on ABC’s “This Week.” “But we’re trying to avoid that.”

Rubio, who is also Trump’s national security adviser, also voiced caution on the progress made.

“We’re still a long ways off,” he said. [![AP Logo](https://assets.apnews.com/19/66/bc546486408c8595f01753a9fbeb/ap-logo-176-by-208.svg)](/)

Content: "This complicates the situation," the Ukrainian president said in a statement on X.

On Monday, Zelensky will travel to Washington DC, where US President Donald Trump has said he will urge the Ukrainian leader to agree to a peace deal.

Trump said he wants to bypass a ceasefire in Ukraine and move directly to a permanent peace agreement after his meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin.

In a major shift in position, the US president wrote on Truth Social following Friday's summit that this would be "the best way to end the horrific war", as ceasefires often "do not hold up".

*   [Live coverage of this story](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/cev28rvzlv1t)
    

Following a phone call with Trump after the summit, Zelensky called for a real, lasting peace, while adding that "the fire must cease" and killings stop.

He later outlined Ukraine's requirements for "a truly sustainable and reliable peace", including a "credible security guarantee" and the return of children he says were "abducted from occupied territories" by Moscow.

Trump says he wants to bypass a ceasefire in Ukraine, which has been at war with Russia its full-scale invasion began in February 2022

Trump had previously threatened "very severe consequences" if Putin did not agree to end the war, last month setting a deadline for Moscow to reach a ceasefire or face tough new sanctions, including secondary tariffs on its allies.

But the two left Friday's talks with no agreement reach, despite both insisting progress had been made.

On Saturday, Putin described the summit as "very useful" and said he had been able "set out our position" to Trump.

"We had the opportunity, which we did, to talk about the genesis, about the causes of this crisis," the Russian president said. in under 2 minutes\

Sir Keir Starmer hosted Zelensky ahead of the US-Russia summit, with the pair agreeing there was "a strong resolve to achieve a just and lasting peace"

European leaders - including Merz, French President Emmanuel Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen - said "the next step must now be further talks including President Zelensky".

"It will be up to Ukraine to make decisions on its territory," they said, adding: "International borders must not be changed by force."

UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer praised Trump's efforts to end the war, saying they had "brought us closer than ever before", but said the "path to peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without" Zelensky.

In Kyiv, Ukrainians have described feeling "crushed" by the scenes from Alaska.

"I understand that for negotiations you shake hands, you can't just slap Putin in the face when he arrives," Serhii Orlyk, a 50-year-old veteran from Donetsk, said.

"But this spectacle with the red carpet and the kneeling soldiers - it's terrible, it makes no sense."

Russia complicating end to war, says Zelensky, as Trump pursues peace deal

Trump had said before the summit on Friday that he wanted a ceasefire "rapidly", having threatened Russia with economic sanctions if one was not agreed.

Ukraine's main demand has been a quick ceasefire before talks on a longer-term settlement, with Trump reportedly telling European leaders beforehand that his goal for the summit was to obtain a ceasefire deal.

Putin reportedly presented Trump with a peace offer that would require Ukraine withdrawing from the Donetsk region of the Donbas, in return for Russia freezing the front lines in Zaporizhzhia and Kherson.

Russia claims the Donbas as Russian territory, controlling most of Luhansk and about 70% of Donetsk. It also illegally annexed the Crimean peninsula in 2014, eight years before launching its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

*   [Five takeaways from the meeting](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gj9er0x0zo)
    

Trump, who has previously said any peace deal would involve "some swapping of territories", is said to have relayed the offer to Zelensky in their call following the summit.

Just days ago, Ukraine's president ruled out ceding control of the Donbas - composed of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions - saying it could be used as a springboard for future Russian attacks.

The BBC's US partner CBS has reported, citing diplomatic sources, that European officials were concerned Trump may try to pressure Zelensky into agreeing to terms that may have been discussed at Friday's summit when they meet on Monday.

CBS quotes sources as saying that Trump had told European leaders that Putin would make "some concessions", but failed to specify what they were.

In an interview with Fox News following the US-Russia summit in Alaska, Trump was asked what advice he had for the Ukrainian leader, to which he replied: "Make a deal."

He added: "Russia's a very big power and they're not."

! He wouldn't say if Putin should now meet Zelensky.

European leaders have reacted with caution to the outcome of the Trump-Putin meeting, seeking not to criticise the change of direction despite their long-held support for a ceasefire.

However, Trump notably said the US was prepared to provide security guarantees for Ukraine - a key request of Zelensky's and the "coalition of the willing", a group of nations, including the UK, France and Germany, that have pledged to protect peace in Ukraine once it is achieved.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz called this "significant progress".

The group will hold a call on Sunday afternoon before Zelensky visits the White House on Monday.

Volodymyr Zelensky has said that Russia's refusal to agree to a ceasefire is complicating efforts to end the war.

"We see that Russia rebuffs numerous calls for a ceasefire and has not yet determined when it will stop the killing. "It is the elimination of these root causes that should be the basis for settlement."

A senior Russian diplomat later told BBC Newshour that the summit had been "a very important building block for further efforts" to end the war.

Russia's first deputy permanent representative to the UN, Dmitry Polyanskiy, said that everybody who wanted peace "should be satisfied by the outcome"."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
On February 12, 2025, Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin had a phone call, as reported by the Kremlin's website ([http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/76259](http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/76259)) and CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/12/politics/putin-trump-phone-call](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/12/politics/putin-trump-phone-call)). The conversation included discussions about prisoner exchange, the root causes of the conflict, and a sustainable settlement via peaceful negotiations.

CNN reported that Trump said negotiations to end the Ukraine war would start "immediately" after the call. The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_2025_Putin%E2%80%93Trump_phone_call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_2025_Putin%E2%80%93Trump_phone_call)) also mentions the phone call.


### Evidence from `web_search`
According to an NBC News article from July 19, 2025, Donald Trump planned meetings with Zelenskyy and Putin to end the war between Russia and Ukraine, and he wanted to extricate the United States from foreign wars. The Associated Press reported that Vladimir Putin agreed that the U.S. and Europe could offer Ukraine security guarantees. The BBC reported on August 17, 2025, that Trump wanted to bypass a ceasefire and move directly to a permanent peace agreement after his meeting with Putin, which was to take place in Alaska.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that after the February 12, 2025, call, Trump stated that negotiations to end the war would start "immediately" ([https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/12/politics/putin-trump-phone-call](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/12/politics/putin-trump-phone-call)). However, the evidence does not support the claim that Trump announced an agreement to end the war on that date.

Later reports from July and August 2025 suggest that Trump was planning meetings with both Putin and Zelenskyy to end the war ([https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-pressures-ukraine-end-war-ahead-zelenskyy-meeting-rcna225476](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-pressures-ukraine-end-war-ahead-zelenskyy-meeting-rcna225476), [https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c04rv2p3936o](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c04rv2p3936o)). These later reports do not confirm that an agreement was reached after the initial call.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.

Initially, the known number of Ukrainian military casualties varied widely due to the Ukrainian Army drastically understating its casualties,[\[19\]](#cite_note-hides-22)
 as reported by medics, activists and soldiers on the ground, as well as at least one lawmaker.[\[19\]](#cite_note-hides-22)
[\[20\]](#cite_note-23)
[\[21\]](#cite_note-24)
[\[22\]](#cite_note-25)
 Several medical officials reported they were overstretched due to the drastic number of casualties.[\[19\]](#cite_note-hides-22)

 stated that the numbers recorded by the National Museum of Military History were the official ones, although still incomplete,[\[23\]](#cite_note-26)
 with 4,638 deaths (4,500 identified and 138 unidentified) cataloged by 1 December 2021.[\[10\]](#cite_note-memory0-11)

, 1,175 of the Ukrainian servicemen died due to non-combat causes by 5 March 2021.[\[24\]](#cite_note-27)
 Subsequently, the military did not publish new figures on their non-combat losses, stating they could be considered a state secret.[\[25\]](#cite_note-28)

Faced with mounting losses in Ukraine, the Russian authorities moved quickly to decide how the deaths of soldiers would be reported. **Russian losses in the war with Ukraine.**  
Mediazona count, updated
======================================================================

_Mediazona,_ in collaboration with _BBC News_ Russian service and a team of volunteers, maintains a named list of deceased Russian military personnel. Here we report what we’ve learned about the losses during this time and the events at the front that led to the deaths of Russian soldiers.

**Interactive Infographics.** The second part showcases visual representations of losses since the beginning of the war: for example, where the deceased served or in which regions they lived. These are absolute numbers, not adjusted for population or number of military units.

On the map, you can choose between total losses and losses by military branch, as well as see where the deceased mobilised soldiers were from.

In most cases, from death reports or indirect signs (uniform or sleeve patches in photos), it’s possible to determine which branch of the military the deceased served in, or how they joined the army (mobilised, volunteer, prisoner, etc.)

We compared these groups of servicemen on a separate graph.

From early summer and into the mid-fall season of 2022, volunteers bore the brunt of the losses, which is strikingly different from the situation in the initial stage of the war: in winter and early spring, the Airborne Forces suffered the greatest damage, followed by the Motorised Rifle troops.

By the end of 2022 and the beginning of the next year, losses among prisoners recruited into the _Wagner PMC_ increased markedly. The children are too young to understand what the plaques mean, but they walk past them all the same.

What we know about losses
-------------------------

Here’s how the losses are distributed across Russian regions. They were formed into “assault groups” to overwhelm Ukrainian positions near Bakhmut.

By March 2023, prisoners became the largest category of war losses. By November 2024, this figure had dropped to between 2–3%—a shift that reflects both evolving combat tactics and the intensive recruitment of volunteer infantry, who suffer casualty rates many times higher than their commanding officers.

**Officers killed in Ukraine**

To date, reports of the deaths of two deputy army commanders have been officially confirmed—Major General Andrei Sukhovetsky of the 41st Army and Major General Vladimir Frolov of the 8th Army.

On May 22, 2022, fighter pilot, 63-year-old retired Major General Kanamat Botashev died; most likely, he went to war as a volunteer. This list is not exhaustive, as not every military death becomes public knowledge.

To provide a more comprehensive picture of the war’s impact, we offer a second figure: an estimate of excess mortality among men, based on Probate registry data. This method was developed in collaboration with _Meduza_, to address the limitations of relying solely on publicly reported deaths.

This month, Russia’s wartime toll of dead and wounded reached a historic milestone.

According to the British Ministry of Defence, more than one million Russian troops have been killed or injured since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine began on 24 February 2022.

The estimate aligns with a recent [study by the US-based Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS)](https://www.csis.org/analysis/russias-battlefield-woes-ukraine)
, which puts Russian military deaths at up to 250,000 and total casualties, including the wounded, at over 950,000. Ukraine has suffered very high losses as well, with between 60,000 and 100,000 personnel killed and total casualties reaching approximately 400,000.

While precise wartime casualty figures are notoriously difficult to verify, the independent Russian outlet Mediazona has identified the [names of more than 111,000 Russian military personnel killed](https://en.zona.media/article/2025/06/06/casualties_eng-trl)

One million and counting: Russian casualties hit milestone in Ukraine war
=========================================================================

This article is more than 2 months old

As grim tally of its invasion is reached, expansive propaganda campaign and state payouts are keeping grieving relatives onside

!Two Russian soldiers preparing the grave for the coffin of a comrade <image:13534>[View image in fullscreen](#img-1)

Russian fatalities are estimated to be five times higher than the combined death toll from all Soviet and Russian wars between the end of the second world war and the start of its invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Part of the reason: Russia’s casualties in its continuing invasion of [Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine)
.

Few regions in Russia have sent as many men to fight and die in Ukraine as the republic of Bashkortostan, whose capital, Ufa, draws recruits from poorer surrounding areas in search of money.

“Sometimes, I check the name of the person we’re burying and realise it’s someone I know – someone I went to school with or met before,” said Nikolai, who asked that his last name be withheld for fear of government reprisal.

For now, Moscow appears able to replenish its manpower for the war, allowing it to slowly advance and capture more territory in Ukraine despite the human cost.

Military recruitment continues to surge across many regions, with signing bonuses for contracts to join the war reaching record highs – up to 2m rubles (about $25,000).

Janis Kluge, a researcher on the Russian economy at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, estimates Russia recruited 89,601 men between January and March 2025, based on federal spending on sign-up bonuses.

“This represents a 22% increase over the same period last year,” Kluge said.

Nikolai, the funeral home director, said he’s closely watching the ongoing peace talks between Russia and Ukraine to determine his next business move.

“Of course, I hope this ends soon and the deaths stop,” he said, noting with disappointment the talks appear to have stalled. “It just feels wrong to be making money off young guys dying.”

----------- The outlet believes the true death toll is significantly higher.

These are staggering figures by any measure of comparison in modern Russian history.

In just over three years, Russian fatalities are estimated to be five times higher than the combined death toll from all Soviet and Russian wars between the end of the second world war and the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022.

The war in Ukraine has proved far deadlier for the Kremlin than other recent conflicts: Russia’s losses are roughly 15 times greater than those suffered during the Soviet Union’s decade-long war in Afghanistan, and 10 times higher than in Russia’s 13-year war in Chechnya.

And it’s not just the dead returning in caskets – soldiers with amputated limbs and serious injuries are also coming home, driving a sharp rise in the production of prosthetic limbs.

“We doubled the number of our clients one year into the conflict and since then it has been a steady 10% increase annually,” said Igor Vinogradov, the director of a mid-sized prosthetics and orthopaedics firm in northern Russia.

“By far, the majority are war veterans,” Vinogradov said, adding that his company relies on imported prosthetic arms and legs from Germany, as well as some homegrown technology.

!Soldiers stand next to a casket holding a Russian flag <image:13536>[View image in fullscreen](#img-3)

The funeral of Alexander Skobelev, a soldier killed in the war with Ukraine, is held at a cemetery in Shlisselburg, in the Leningrad oblast. He said the government has made it harder to track the long-term demographic consequences of the ongoing fighting.

“Russia stopped publishing all mortality and life expectancy data for its male population from 2024 onwards,” Raksha said.

Russian anti-war activists, inside and outside the country, initially believed the rising number of returning bodies would spark public protests.

The Russian flagship of its Black Sea fleet, the Moskva, sank after being struck by Ukrainian missiles in April 2022. He fulfilled his purpose.”

Instead of widespread public discontent, the opposite now appears to be true: many Russians who have lost relatives are urging the Kremlin to press on, convinced that the losses must be justified.

Among them is Dmitry Shkrebets, whose son, Yegor, was one of more than three dozen sailors killed when [Ukraine struck Russia’s Black Sea flagship, the Moskva](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/14/russia-moskva-cruiser-sunk-stormy-seas-defense-ministry)
, in 2022.

Shkrebets now runs a blog in which he routinely urges Russia to step up its attacks on Ukraine.

Over the past few years, Nikolai has seen the ups and downs of the funeral trade in his native Ufa, a Russian city in the plains west of the Ural mountains.

The coronavirus pandemic, which hit Russia with devastating force, brought an unexpected boom to his family-run business, forcing him to hire extra staff almost overnight to cope with the rise in funeral demand.

“But after Covid, there was a real dip; people just stopped dying in such numbers,” Nikolai said.

That lull didn’t last."

**The Issue**
-------------

_Russian military forces have failed to effectively advance along multiple axes in Ukraine, seized limited territory, lost substantial quantities of equipment relative to Ukraine, and suffered remarkably high rates of fatalities and casualties since January 2024, according to new CSIS data. While some policymakers and experts argue that Russia holds “all the cards” in the Ukraine war, the data suggests that the Russian military has performed relatively poorly on the battlefield._

There has been a growing chorus of policymakers and analysts who argue that the Russian military holds the initiative in the war in Ukraine and will likely triumph. I think that people in Ukraine need to realize what is going on.”4 Andrei Kartapolov, head of the defense committee in the Duma, Russia’s lower legislative chamber, followed Putin’s comments with threats that if Ukraine did not accede to Russia’s maximalist demands in peace negotiations, Ukrainian leaders would be forced to listen to “the language of the Russian bayonet.”5

To better understand the state of the war and Russia’s battlefield performance, this analysis asks: How successful has the Russian military been in achieving the Kremlin’s objectives? and European military assistance to Ukraine would likely raise the costs for Moscow of a protracted war and could facilitate peace talks.

Russia’s poor performance has likely been caused by several factors: the Russian military’s reliance on dismounted infantry and mechanized forces to take Ukrainian territory, Russia’s failure to use operational fires in a coordinated way that enables maneuver, and Ukraine’s effective utilization of defense in depth. Instead, firepower has become unmoored from maneuver.”21 In addition, the Russian military has suffered from weak coordination of units and a lack of battlefield flexibility and initiative of soldiers.

Ukrainian forces have also imposed significant costs with their defense in depth in a war that has largely favored the defending side.22 Ukraine has used trenches, dragon’s teeth, mines, and other barriers—along with artillery and drones—to attrit advancing Russian soldiers and vehicles. No Soviet or Russian war since World War II has even come close to Ukraine in terms of fatality rate.

Remote Visualization

In addition, over 950,000 Russian soldiers have been killed and wounded since the war began.36 As Figure 8 highlights, Russia’s daily average of casualties has increased _every year_ since 2022. As this analysis shows, Russian military forces have failed to significantly advance on the battlefield, seized limited territory, lost substantial quantities of equipment relative to Ukraine, and suffered high rates of fatalities and casualties. academic contended, “the United States and the West more generally and Ukraine have lost in the war over Ukraine,” and “the Russians are going to win.”1 Dmytro Kuleba, a former Ukrainian foreign minister, remarked that unless the current trajectory changes, “we will lose this war.”2 In addition, some U.S. Even more noteworthy, Russian equipment losses have been significantly higher than Ukrainian losses, varying between a ratio of 5:1 and 2:1 in Ukraine’s favor.

Fourth, Russian fatalities and casualties have been extraordinary. Overall, a high of 250,000 Russian soldiers have died in Ukraine, with over 950,000 total Russian casualties, a sign of Putin’s blatant disregard for his soldiers."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that the claim is plausible but not definitively confirmed. A Russia Matters report from February 26, 2025, indicates over 700,000 killed or injured and 48,000 missing as of January 2025. A Wikipedia article mentions a British Army official's estimate of 1.5 to 1.8 million casualties by July 2024. The Guardian reported in June 2025 that over one million Russian troops had been killed or injured since the full-scale invasion began. The CSIS study estimates up to 250,000 deaths and over 950,000 total casualties.

The claim of 1.5 million losses falls within the range of estimates provided by different sources. However, the exact number is not explicitly stated in the provided evidence.

Therefore, the claim is likely, but the exact number is not directly supported by the evidence.

Content: "**Russian losses in the war with Ukraine.**  
Mediazona count, updated
======================================================================

_Mediazona_, working with the _BBC’s_ Russian service and a team of volunteers, has been compiling and maintaining a named list of the Russian military dead. This statistical method, created in collaboration with _Meduza_, helps to account for the limitations of relying solely on publicly reported deaths.

About our reports
-----------------

This publication is divided into two parts:

**Bi-weekly Summary.** A text summary, updated every two weeks, in which we report on what we have learned about recent losses and the frontline events that led to the deaths of Russian soldiers.

**Interactive Infographics.** The second part provides visualisations of the losses since the start of the war, showing, for example, where the dead served or which regions they came from. We update the data for these graphics, while the accompanying text is refreshed but remains largely the same.

A detailed description of our method for estimating total deaths using Probate Registry data can be [found at this link](https://en.zona.media/article/2024/02/24/75k-trl)
.

**Last update to the named list:** August 29, 2025.

**Last update to the Probate Registry estimate:** August 29, 2025; estimate as of August 2025

Full named list of verified losses is available here: [**200.zona.media**](https://200.zona.media)

For this summary, we, in collaboration with _Meduza_, have updated our estimate of the actual number of deaths based on the Probate Registry (for more on the method, see [our first publication](https://en.zona.media/article/2023/07/10/stats-trl)
).

Our analysis shows that **by August 2025, around 220,000 Russian men between 18 and 55 had been killed in the war.**

In our work with the Probate Registry, we found that male mortality reached a new peak in November 2024, at approximately **3,000 deaths per week.**

We cannot yet say with absolute certainty that losses were this high at the end of 2024. By November 2024, this figure had dropped to between 2–3%—a shift that reflects both evolving combat tactics and the intensive recruitment of volunteer infantry, who suffer casualty rates many times higher than their commanding officers.

**Officers killed in Ukraine**

To date, the deaths of 12 Russian generals have been officially confirmed: three Lieutenant Generals, seven Major Generals, and two who had retired from active service.

Lieutenant General Oleg Tsokov, deputy commander of the Southern Military District, [was killed](https://www.fontanka.ru/2023/07/12/72489656/)
 in July 2023. It is also possible that many of these losses were simply invisible to our open-source counting methods.

One likely explanation is the huge number of lawsuits that began flooding Russian courts in the second half of 2024, seeking to have soldiers officially declared missing in action or deceased.

_Mediazona_ [has reported](https://en.zona.media/article/2025/06/05/mia)
 on this process in detail. They are, however, visible in the mortality estimate.

By the start of August, Russian courts had received **around 50,000 such** **military-related claims**. These are absolute figures and have not been adjusted for population or number of military units.

You can filter the map to show total losses, losses by branch of service, or the home regions of mobilised soldiers who were killed.

In most cases, official reports or visual cues like uniforms and insignia allow us to determine a soldier’s branch of service, or how he came to be in the army (mobilised, volunteer, prisoner, etc.).

The chart below compares these different groups of servicemen.

From early summer and into the mid-fall season of 2022, volunteers bore the brunt of the losses, which is strikingly different from the situation in the initial stage of the war: in winter and early spring, the Airborne Forces suffered the greatest damage, followed by the Motorised Rifle troops.

By the end of 2022 and the beginning of the next year, losses among prisoners recruited into the _Wagner PMC_ increased markedly. This shift reflects a cumulative effect: prison recruitment had significantly waned, no new mobilisation had been announced, yet the stream of volunteers continued unabated.

By August 29, the death of **over** **5,500** **officers** of the Russian army and other security agencies had been confirmed.

The proportion of officer deaths among overall casualties has steadily declined since the conflict began. Lieutenant General Yaroslav Moskalik, a senior officer in the General Staff’s Main Operational Directorate, [was killed](https://zona.media/news/2025/04/25/balashikha)
 by a car bomb in a Moscow suburb in April 2025.

Two deputy army commanders, Major General [Andrei Sukhovetsky](https://admnvrsk.ru/o-gorode/novosti/glavnye-novosti/news-03032022200708-105771/)
 (41st Army) and Major General [Vladimir Frolov](https://www.fontanka.ru/2022/04/16/71262053/)
 (8th Army), were killed in the first weeks of the war. In November 2023, Major General Vladimir Zavadsky, deputy commander of the 14th Army Corps, [was killed](https://zona.media/news/2023/12/04/zavadsky)
 near the village of Krynky.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
According to a Russia Matters report from February 26, 2025, Russia had over 700,000 killed or injured and 48,000 missing as of January 2025. The report also mentions that Donald Trump estimated 1 million Russian soldiers had been killed in January 2025. ([https://www.russiamatters.org/news/russia-ukraine-war-report-card/russia-ukraine-war-report-card-feb-26-2025](https://www.russiamatters.org/news/russia-ukraine-war-report-card/russia-ukraine-war-report-card-feb-26-2025)) <image:1>, <image:2>, <image:3>, <image:4>, <image:5>

A Wikipedia article states that a British Army official said in July 2024 that the war could cost Russia 1.5 to 1.8 million casualties. By the end of 2024, Meduza estimated over 165,000 Russian soldiers had died. As of the beginning of February 2025, 1,382 Russian servicemen previously thought missing were confirmed to be in Ukrainian captivity. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War)) Mediazona, in collaboration with BBC News Russian service, provided an estimate of Russian losses, with the last update on February 24, 2025, with data as of December 2024. By November 2024, the number of losses among prisoners had dropped to between 2–3%. ([https://en.zona.media/article/2025/08/01/casualties_eng-trl](https://en.zona.media/article/2025/08/01/casualties_eng-trl))


### Evidence from `web_search`
The Guardian published an article on June 22, 2025, stating that over one million Russian troops have been killed or injured since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine began on February 24, 2022 (<image:13534>, <image:13536>, <image:13537>). The article references a study by the US-based Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), which estimates Russian military deaths at up to 250,000 and total casualties, including the wounded, at over 950,000.

The CSIS analysis, published on June 3, 2025, indicates that over 950,000 Russian soldiers have been killed and wounded since the war began. It also mentions that up to 250,000 Russian soldiers have died in Ukraine.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the claim is plausible but not definitively confirmed. A Russia Matters report from February 26, 2025, indicates over 700,000 killed or injured and 48,000 missing as of January 2025. A Wikipedia article mentions a British Army official's estimate of 1.5 to 1.8 million casualties by July 2024. The Guardian reported in June 2025 that over one million Russian troops had been killed or injured since the full-scale invasion began. The CSIS study estimates up to 250,000 deaths and over 950,000 total casualties.

The claim of 1.5 million losses falls within the range of estimates provided by different sources. However, the exact number is not explicitly stated in the provided evidence.

Therefore, the claim is likely, but the exact number is not directly supported by the evidence.

===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence provides additional information on Russian casualties. Mediazona, in collaboration with the BBC's Russian service, estimates that by August 2025, around 220,000 Russian men between 18 and 55 had been killed in the war. This figure is significantly lower than the 1.5 million claimed. The evidence also mentions the confirmed deaths of over 5,500 officers by August 2025.

In a wide-ranging conversation on [Theo Von's podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g)
, [former President Donald Trump](https://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/donald-trump/)
 asked the comedian at one point about his use of cocaine, alcohol and history with addiction.

The latest episode of Von's podcast, "[This Past Weekend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g)
" posted Tuesday and was filmed at the Trump National Golf Club Bedminster in Bedminster, New Jersey.

During the episode, Von asked Trump about not drinking and smoking, to which Trump replied that [he never has](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2018/10/01/donald-trump-beer-joke/1488351002/)
, mentioning his older brother, Fred Trump Jr., who he said had a problem with alcohol.

"I tell people, no drugs, no drinking, no cigarettes," Trump said. "I tell that to my kids all the time, I say 'no drugs, no drinking, no smoking.'"

Trump said he looked up to and admired his brother, who died in 1981, calling him an "incredible personality." He added that he's heard alcohol is "tougher to get off of than drugs," to which Von said that he himself is in recovery from drug and alcohol use.

The former president discussed a variety of other topics during the episode, including his relationship with his family, health care, lobbying, President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris and the 2024 presidential election.

**2024 Presidential Election:** [Donald Trump (pretty much) sticks to the script on Harris. Von said, "No, it's horrible, but you do it anyway, just like the guy you're saying with the scotch," referring to an earlier conversation about alcohol.

Trump asked Von which substance he thought was a bigger problem in the U.S.: alcohol or opioids, to which Von responded opioids.

"It's just so typical of what we see from Russia, \[to\] take advantage of an ongoing crisis for their own ends," said Darren Linvill, a communications professor and co-director of Clemson University's Media Forensics Hub.

The Ukrainian general story first emerged on a pro-Russian Telegram channel four days after the fires started in Los Angeles. Some of the posts amplifying the baseless claim falsely credited it to United24 Media, a website affiliated with the Ukrainian government.

The Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council's Center for Countering Disinformation issued a [statement](https://x.com/CforCD/status/1878381491056501245)
 describing the claim as "Russian propaganda." It said it had verified with United24 Media that it did not create or share the story.

NPR has not obtained evidence that any Ukrainian generals owned homes in Los Angeles that were destroyed by the fires. Both @OlgaBazova and Patterson's posts received user-generated community notes on X citing the Greek fact check.

The unverified claim about the alleged Ukrainian-owned mansions also appeared on other social media platforms including Tik Tok, TruthSocial and the Russian site VK, but did not gain much traction.

The story is the latest example of Russia's shift away from using fake social media profiles impersonating real people, as it did during the 2016 and 2020 U.S. Accounts tied to previous China influence operations spread false claims about the fire's origins.

While the story about Ukrainian officials got more traction than the other narratives about the fires originating from Russia-allied channels, Linvill said, it has not yet spread as widely as previous narratives linked to Russia."

MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:

And now to California, where firefighters in Los Angeles are making progress getting those massive wildfires under control. Both @OlgaBazova and Patterson's posts received user-generated community notes on X citing the Greek fact check.

The unverified claim about the alleged Ukrainian-owned mansions also appeared on other social media platforms including Tik Tok, TruthSocial and the Russian site VK, but did not gain much traction.

The story is the latest example of Russia's shift away from using fake social media profiles impersonating real people, as it did during the 2016 and 2020 U.S. Accounts tied to previous China influence operations spread false claims about the fire's origins.

While the story about Ukrainian officials got more traction than the other narratives about the fires originating from Russia-allied channels, Linvill said, it has not yet spread as widely as previous narratives linked to Russia. So this particular narrative, what it alleges is that mansions of eight Ukrainian generals were amongst the homes destroyed."

!Briefing Of The Commander-In-Chief Of The Armed Forces Of Ukraine Valerii Zaluzhnyi <image:2342>

General Valerii Zaluzhnyi was among those reported to have a home in Los Angeles, even though he lives in London now as Ukraine's ambassador to the UK. The Russian propaganda effort is thus to encourage support for the war at home while making those in the West question any aid that has been sent to Kyiv.

"People predisposed to believing narratives like this will take it to be another 'false' datapoint of corruption and largesse in the Ukrainian military, and at the same time, a sweet act of karma that these imaginary mansions are burning to the ground," said Schmidt. The total value of these properties amounts to $90 million and was allegedly purchased with funds provided by the West as part of economic aid to Kyiv after the war began."

Subsequent posts [named Valerii Zaluzhnyi](https://t.me/naspravdiinfo/104501 "https://t.me/naspravdiinfo/104501")
, former Ukrainian four-star general and current ambassador of Ukraine to the United Kingdom, as being among those who have lost their homes.

Satire, But Really Disinformation
---------------------------------

The initial post on Telegram did indeed include the hashtag "сатира" (Russian for satire), but subsequent reposts lacked any mention that it was made in jest. Yet, even as "satire," it isn't clear where the humor lies in the original post, except possibly to Russian audiences who might find joy that any Ukrainian would see their home burns down in the devastating California fires.

"There is zero evidence that any Ukrainian generals own any property in L.A., much less mansions," said Dr. It's not just about the misinformation – it's about how quickly it crosses platforms and gains traction."

Disinformation Fits An Existing Narrative
-----------------------------------------

All of these disinformation campaigns have a common thread – they're based on the unsubstantiated belief that Ukrainian officials are getting rich while the war continues. Matthew Schmidt, professor of national security and political science at the University of New Haven.

Humor likely wasn't even the point, and instead, the channels posting the claims likely wanted it to be believed as fact – much like the news last summer that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spent $15 million to [buy a Mercedes 770 automobile](https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2024/10/09/despite-online-claims-ukraines-zelensky-didnt-buy-hitlers-car/ "https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2024/10/09/despite-online-claims-ukraines-zelensky-didnt-buy-hitlers-car/")
 that was previously owned by Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler, or that Zelensky's wife purchased a [Bugatti sports car](https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2024/07/02/social-media-posts-claim-zelenskys-wife-spent-millions-on-bugatti-sportscar/ "https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2024/07/02/social-media-posts-claim-zelenskys-wife-spent-millions-on-bugatti-sportscar/")

Pro-Kremlin social media accounts spread a baseless narrative that mansions belonging to Ukrainian military officials burned down in the Los Angeles wildfires, according to articles from NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2025/01/16/nx-s1-5259842/los-angeles-california-fires-russia-ukraine](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/16/nx-s1-5259842/los-angeles-california-fires-russia-ukraine)) and Houston Public Media ([https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/npr/2025/01/16/nx-s1-5259842/russia-tried-to-use-the-l-a-wildfires-to-spread-anti-ukraine-propaganda/](https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/npr/2025/01/16/nx-s1-5259842/russia-tried-to-use-the-l-a-wildfires-to-spread-anti-ukraine-propaganda/)). The claim was debunked by fact-checkers from Greece and the United States. The Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council's Center for Countering Disinformation described the claim as "Russian propaganda." NPR has not obtained evidence that any Ukrainian generals owned homes in Los Angeles that were destroyed by the fires.

Forbes ([https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2025/01/13/satire-or-disinformation-ukrainian-generals-lost-homes-in-la-fires/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2025/01/13/satire-or-disinformation-ukrainian-generals-lost-homes-in-la-fires/)) states that there is zero evidence to support this claim, which originated on a Russian Telegram channel and was initially satire. The claim is part of a disinformation campaign based on the unsubstantiated belief that Ukrainian officials are getting rich while the war continues. <image:2335> <image:2342>


## Elaboration
The claim is false. The evidence indicates that the claim originated from a Russian Telegram channel and was part of a disinformation campaign. Fact-checkers from Greece and the United States debunked the claim. NPR has not found any evidence to support the claim that Ukrainian generals owned homes in Los Angeles that were destroyed by the fires ([https://www.npr.org/2025/01/16/nx-s1-5259842/los-angeles-california-fires-russia-ukraine](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/16/nx-s1-5259842/los-angeles-california-fires-russia-ukraine)). Forbes also states that there is zero evidence to support the claim ([https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2025/01/13/satire-or-disinformation-ukrainian-generals-lost-homes-in-la-fires/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2025/01/13/satire-or-disinformation-ukrainian-generals-lost-homes-in-la-fires/)).

# Search Result
From [Source](https://city-countyobserver.com/a-tale-of-two-wealthy-senators/): 
Content: "Senators Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Chuck Schumer of New York are prominent examples, each reportedly worth tens of millions of dollars despite earning approximately $200,000 annually in their federal roles. This inheritance was a key factor in a significant jump in McConnell’s reported net worth.

In addition to his marriage, McConnell has been a savvy political operator. For instance, McConnell’s alignment with corporate interests has ensured steady campaign contributions, bolstering his influence and indirectly enhancing his financial security.

#### **Chuck Schumer: Real Estate Deals and Financial Savvy**

Senator Chuck Schumer, representing New York since 1998, has also achieved remarkable financial success, with recent estimates suggesting his net worth surpasses $60 million. **Spousal Wealth and Inheritance**: Marriages to affluent individuals or inheritances significantly boost the net worth of some politicians, as seen with McConnell.
3. Senegal (sneaky but legal) was intrigued and here is the result.

#### **Mitch McConnell: Wealth Through Marriage and Political Longevity**

Senator Mitch McConnell has long been a fixture in American politics, representing Kentucky since 1985 and serving as Senate Majority Leader for several years. His reported net worth exceeds $30 million, a figure that belies his relatively modest government salary. New York’s status as a financial hub has further enabled him to cultivate relationships with high-net-worth individuals and corporations. **Campaign Fundraising and Financial Management**: While campaign funds are strictly regulated, the infrastructure and networks built for fundraising often have ancillary financial benefits for politicians.

The wealth of Senators McConnell and Schumer illustrates how political careers, coupled with advantageous circumstances, can lead to substantial financial gains. Unlike McConnell, Schumer’s wealth stems less from family ties and more from strategic investments, particularly in real estate.

Schumer reportedly acquired several properties early in his career, often benefiting from favorable terms. While such practices are not necessarily illegal, they highlight how political influence can open doors to lucrative opportunities.

Additionally, Schumer’s position as Senate Majority Leader has amplified his access to influential networks."

Misinformation is often spread regarding Russia's war in Ukraine to sway public opinion about support for Kyiv and put pressure on western governments.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](https://static.euronews.com/website/images/logos/logo-euronews-stacked-outlined-72x72-grey-9.svg) ADVERTISEMENT

An image doing the rounds on social media allegedly shows a list of US politicians, including President Joe Biden, who have received bribes in return for support for Ukraine.

Text accompanying the list claims that a Ukrainian official released the names, as well as the amounts that each person has supposedly received.

Biden has allegedly received $92 million (€89.6 million), for example, while former speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi has taken home $86 million, and former senator Mitt Romney has received $71 million, according to the list.

The image, posted on the likes of Threads and X, shows a range of politicians across the US political divide.

Regardless, the claims are false — there's no evidence that any of the individuals mentioned have received any illicit payments from Ukraine in return for their pushing of support for Kyiv against the Russian invasion.

There are no legitimate news outlets reporting on the news, and it's also implausible that a Ukrainian official would release the statistics and incriminate the very politicians the country is relying on for financial aid.

The text accompanying the list tends to be badly written — another hallmark of untrustworthy news, especially as the mistakes are often the same, suggesting they're copied, pasted, and shared en masse.

Searching for earlier instances of the claims on X shows that it originates from at least as far back as 2023, and has been shared on various occasions since then.

Other fact-checkers from reputable news organisations debunked the claims at those times as well, and there's no reason to believe that the situation has changed since then.

Pro-Russian propaganda and other Ukraine detractors are often keen to spread false or misleading claims about support for Kyiv to sway public opinion and in turn, put pressure on western governments.

As of 30 September 2024, the US's Ukraine response funding totals nearly $183 billion since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, according to official Ukraine Oversight figures.

In Europe, as of January, the EU says it has made available more than $140 billion in financial, military, humanitarian and refugee assistance through its collective and individual member-state measures in the same period.

Washington is Ukraine's single biggest donor, yet as Donald Trump prepares to reenter the White House, European allies are concerned that the US could reduce or even stop providing aid altogether due to the president-elect's previous criticism of the amount the US sends.

The outgoing Biden administration is giving Ukraine as much military support as it can, including a $500 million weapons package aimed at putting Kyiv in the strongest possible position for potential negotiations to end the war. 

The defence ministers of Europe's five biggest military spenders — France, Germany, Italy, Poland and the UK — met near Warsaw on Monday to discuss maintaining support for Ukraine and enhancing domestic weapons production ahead of any shifts in US policy.

Hunter Biden (left) with his father, current US President Joe Biden

**A top Senate Republican has released an FBI document detailing an allegation President Joe Biden and his son accepted bribes from a Ukrainian firm.**

Chuck Grassley, who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said: "The American people can now read this document for themselves."

The unclassified memo is a June 2020 internal FBI report outlining claims by a foreign informant.

There is no evidence that Joe Biden received any payments from Ukraine.

Senior congressional Republicans have acknowledged the allegation is unverified.

The memo contains a claim that Hunter Biden was hired by the Ukrainian energy company, Burisma, in 2013 as a way to gain support from his father, who was the US vice-president at the time.

*   [Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-66252781)
    
*   [The struggles and scandals of Hunter Biden](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-55805698)
    
*   [What was Hunter Biden doing in China and Ukraine?](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-54553132)
    

It also alleges that Burisma made two $5m (£3.9m) payments to "the Bidens" as part of its efforts to remove Ukraine's prosecutor general at the time, Viktor Shokin - and that there were audio recordings of both Hunter and Joe Biden that supported this.

The informant told the FBI he had learned these details during conversations he had with the Burisma chief executive and other company officials in 2015 or 2016.

! He said voters could now make their own minds up "without the filter of politicians or bureaucrats".

Its public release, however, is a highly unusual move and could further inflame tensions between congressional Republicans and the FBI and Biden administration officials.

Since regaining a majority last year in the House of Representatives after four years of Democratic control, Republicans have launched a range of investigations into President Biden and his family.

The allegations detailed in the FBI document are similar to ones aired over the past several years by Mr Biden's political opponents, including former Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who had repeatedly travelled to Ukraine to conduct his own personal investigations.

Mr Giuliani's accusations against the Bidens became a focus of Mr Trump's first impeachment trial in 2019, which centred on the then-president's efforts to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to announce he was launching an investigation into Joe Biden's supposed ties to Burisma.

Chuck Grassley said releasing the FBI document was in the public interest

Vice-President Biden had publicly pressed for Mr Shokin's removal as part of a larger effort by the Obama administration and US allies due to concerns that he was ineffective in tackling corruption in Ukraine.

Mr Grassley, an Iowa senator, says he obtained a lightly redacted copy of the memo from a justice department "whistleblower" and decided releasing it was in the public interest.

He and other Republicans have said the FBI considers the informant to be highly credible, but the report details how the informant said he could not vouch for the accuracy of the information he was passing along.

Mr Grassley [tweeted a copy of the memo](https://twitter.com/ChuckGrassley/status/1682081403742068746)
 on Thursday. <image:13725>!Getty Images Bill Barr <image:13730>Getty Images

Bill Barr led the corruption inquiry in 2020

Bill Barr, the attorney general under Mr Trump, opened a justice department inquiry into the allegations in 2020.

[He told the Federalist](https://thefederalist.com/2023/06/07/exclusive-bill-barr-confirms-rep-jamie-raskin-lied-about-biden-family-corruption-investigation/)
 last month that he passed the case on to the US attorney in Joe Biden's home state of Delaware.

No charges were ever filed in the case.

White House spokesman Ian Sams said: "It is remarkable that congressional Republicans, in their eagerness to go after President Biden regardless of the truth, continue to push claims that have been debunked for years.

"It's clear that congressional Republicans are dead-set on playing shameless, dishonest politics and refuse to let truth get in the way."

Congressional Republicans learned of the existence of the FBI document detailing the informant's account earlier this year.

They had pressed FBI Director Chris Wray to provide it to the House Oversight Committee - going so far as to threaten to hold him in contempt of Congress if he refused to comply.

He eventually provided members of the committee with the opportunity to privately access a redacted version, but warned that a public release would jeopardise FBI intelligence-gathering methods.

"We have repeatedly explained to Congress, in correspondence and in briefings, how critical it is to keep this source information confidential," the FBI said in a statement.

"Today's release of the 1023 - at a minimum - unnecessarily risks the safety of a confidential source."

After a private review of the document last month, Jamie Raskin, the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, said it contained only unfounded, second-hand accusations and no new details.

The FBI officials have described FD-1023 forms as a means to document "raw, unverified" intelligence information that does not reflect the conclusions of investigators.

"Recording this information does not validate it, establish its credibility, or weigh it against other information known or developed by the FBI in our investigations," the agency said in a recent statement.

Even Senator Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican who with Mr Grassley wrote a Senate report on Hunter Biden, has sounded sceptical about the memo.

[According to the Cedar Rapids Gazette](https://www.thegazette.com/government-politics/iowas-chuck-grassley-releases-fbi-memo-with-unverified-claims-alleging-biden-bribery-scheme/)
, he told a conservative radio show host Vicki McKenna last month: "This could be coming from a very corrupt oligarch who could be making this stuff up."

Since the Independence of [Ukraine](/wiki/Ukraine "Ukraine")
 following the collapse of the [Soviet Union](/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union")
, Russia has had a history of running direct and active measures to undermine the sovereignty of Ukraine.[\[19\]](#cite_note-19)
 This included placing operatives in the government, influencing elections, and encouraging corruption.[\[20\]](#cite_note-20)
[\[21\]](#cite_note-21)
[\[22\]](#cite_note-22)

After the start of the [Russo-Ukrainian War](/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War "Russo-Ukrainian War")
, when Russia invaded Crimea and Eastern Ukraine, Russia began to take active measures to influence presidential elections in the [United States](/wiki/United_States "United States")
.[\[23\]](#cite_note-23)
[\[24\]](#cite_note-24)
 Beginning in 2014, this included efforts to discredit [Joe Biden](/wiki/Joe_Biden "Joe Biden")
.[\[25\]](#cite_note-Mayer-2019-25)

The series of false allegations about Joe Biden and Burisma[\[25\]](#cite_note-Mayer-2019-25)
 emerged at a convergence of interest between Russian efforts to help Trump's candidacy,[\[26\]](#cite_note-Bastos-2019-26)
 operatives and supporters of the Trump campaign,[\[27\]](#cite_note-27)
 and media in the United States.[\[28\]](#cite_note-28)
[\[29\]](#cite_note-29)

The thesis of the false conspiracy theory asserts that Joe Biden sought the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor to protect his son,[\[26\]](#cite_note-Bastos-2019-26)
 and that he did it in a _[quid pro quo](/wiki/Quid_pro_quo "Quid pro quo")
_ manner by trading loan guarantees for the personal favor. \[The informant\] reiterated that, per Zlochevsky, these recordings evidence Zlochevsky was somehow coerced into paying the Bidens to ensure Ukraine Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin was fired.[\[4\]](#cite_note-Prokop_9/28/2023-4)
> [\[34\]](#cite_note-34)

Smirnov also told the FBI that Zlochevsky said Burisma had hired Hunter Biden to "protect us, through his dad, from all kinds of problems."[\[35\]](#cite_note-Whitehurst_Mascaro_2/15/2024-35)

The FD-1023 came to the attention of the Republican-controlled [House Oversight Committee investigation of the Biden family](/wiki/United_States_House_Oversight_Committee_investigation_into_the_Biden_family "United States House Oversight Committee investigation into the Biden family")
 in 2023, leading to allegations of bribery that contributed to the Republican-controlled House voting to initiate impeachment proceedings against President Biden in December 2023. and Israeli citizen who should be detained pending trial; the presiding magistrate judge ordered him released provided he surrender his passports and wear a GPS monitor.[\[38\]](#cite_note-38)

[\[41\]](#cite_note-41)

Conspirators
------------

The falsehoods about Hunter Biden were spread by possible Russian operatives in the Ukrainian parliament,[\[42\]](#cite_note-42)
 right-wing media supportive of Trump,[\[25\]](#cite_note-Mayer-2019-25)
 and members of the Trump campaign, such as [Rudy Giuliani](/wiki/Rudy_Giuliani "Rudy Giuliani")
 and [Steve Bannon](/wiki/Steve_Bannon "Steve Bannon")
.[\[43\]](#cite_note-43)

### Russian involvement

Russian involvement was coordinated by Russian [GRU](/wiki/GRU_(Russian_Federation) "GRU (Russian Federation)")
 lieutenant general [Vladimir Alekseyevin](/wiki/Vladimir_Alekseyev_(general) "Vladimir Alekseyev (general)")
, his deputy Oleksiy Savin, and Ihor Kolesnikov.[\[44\]](#cite_note-44)
 They coordinated a network spreading the false allegations through Ukrainian lawmakers [Oleksandr Dubinsky](/wiki/Oleksandr_Dubinsky "Oleksandr Dubinsky")
 and [Andrii Derkach](/wiki/Andrii_Derkach "Andrii Derkach")
, Prosecutor [Kostiantyn Kulyk](/wiki/Kostiantyn_Kulyk "Kostiantyn Kulyk")
 and businessmen [Dmytro Firtash](/wiki/Dmytro_Firtash "Dmytro Firtash")
 and [Konstantin Kilimnik](/wiki/Konstantin_Kilimnik "Konstantin Kilimnik")
.[\[25\]](#cite_note-Mayer-2019-25)
 The three were given ten million dollars[\[45\]](#cite_note-Stern-2023-45)
 and used corrupt access to the Ukrainian Parliament and connections to media and politicians in the United States to spread the falsehoods.[\[46\]](#cite_note-46)
 Dubinsky, Derkach and Kulyk were sanctioned by the U.S. Dubinsky is accused of treason for allegedly working to help Russia in its war against Ukraine.[\[45\]](#cite_note-Stern-2023-45)

Dubinsky held Press Conference with Andrii Derkach to spread the false rumors.[\[47\]](#cite_note-bbc.com-47)
 He also met with [Rudy Giuliani](/wiki/Rudy_Giuliani "Rudy Giuliani")
 in 2019 for the production of a falsified film about the conspiracy.[\[49\]](#cite_note-49)

In May 2021 Dubinsky was sanctioned by the US Government, his assets frozen, and his [YouTube](/wiki/YouTube "YouTube")
 channel shutdown. 2020 presidential elections.[\[48\]](#cite_note-Meduza-48)

#### Andrii Derkach

[Andrii Derkach](/wiki/Andrii_Derkach "Andrii Derkach")
 is a former Ukrainian politician, now stripped of citizenship,[\[50\]](#cite_note-50)
 who is believed to have been an agent or asset of Russia.[\[51\]](#cite_note-51)
 He played a central role in spreading falsehoods about Biden and Ukraine.[\[25\]](#cite_note-Mayer-2019-25)

Derkach released snippets of a supposed conversation between Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Poroshenko, in which Biden linked loan guarantees to the ouster of Viktor Shokin, the country's corrupt and ineffective prosecutor general.[\[5\]](#cite_note-Kessler-2020-5)
 The recordings, which were not verified as authentic and appeared to be heavily edited,[\[52\]](#cite_note-52)
 did not provide evidence to support the ongoing conspiracy theory that Biden wanted the prosecutor fired to protect his son.[\[53\]](#cite_note-53)
 In June 2020, Poroshenko denied that Joe Biden ever approached him about Burisma and characterized the recordings as fake.[\[54\]](#cite_note-Bertrand-2020-54)
[\[55\]](#cite_note-55)
 In September 2020, the [United States Department of the Treasury](/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury "United States Department of the Treasury")
 sanctioned Derkach, stating he "has been an active Russian agent for over a decade, maintaining close connections with the Russian Intelligence Services". Mr Kulyk wrote a 2019 memo calling for an investigation into Hunter Biden's role on Burisma's board.[\[47\]](#cite_note-bbc.com-47)
 Later that year he had plans to meet Mr Giuliani to discuss the allegations in order to spread the false conspiracy.[\[58\]](#cite_note-facing_scrutiny-58)

Kulyk has been indicted on multiple corruption charges.[\[59\]](#cite_note-59)
 Kulyk, though, fled Ukraine after Russia's invasion in 2022[\[47\]](#cite_note-bbc.com-47)
 and is also sanctioned by the United States for his role in the subversive activities.[\[60\]](#cite_note-60)

#### Dmytro Firtash

[Dmytro Firtash](/wiki/Dmytro_Firtash "Dmytro Firtash")
 was a middleman for [Gazprom](/wiki/Gazprom "Gazprom")
 and connected to the Ukrainian government.[\[61\]](#cite_note-61)
 He has acknowledged that he was installed as a middleman by [Russian mob](/wiki/Russian_mob "Russian mob")
 boss [Semion Mogilevich](/wiki/Semion_Mogilevich "Semion Mogilevich")
.[\[62\]](#cite_note-NBC_News-2020-62)

Since 2014 Firtash has faced bribery charges and fought extradition to the United States while he has been released on bail in Austria. Trump and Giuliani associates Joe DiGenova and Victoria Toensing attempted to persuade Attorney General [William Barr](/wiki/William_Barr "William Barr")
 to drop charges against Firtash but failed.[\[62\]](#cite_note-NBC_News-2020-62)

#### Konstantin Kilimnik

[Konstantin Kilimnik](/wiki/Konstantin_Kilimnik "Konstantin Kilimnik")
 oversaw a network of people working on behalf of the Russian [Federal Security Service](/wiki/Federal_Security_Service "Federal Security Service")
 (FSB) to influence the 2020 elections.[\[63\]](#cite_note-63)
 Kilimnik had the single strongest ties, authorized by [President Putin](/wiki/President_Putin "President Putin")
,[\[64\]](#cite_note-64)
 to the Trump administration in both 2016 and 2020 elections.[\[65\]](#cite_note-65)
 He organized Russia's media outreach campaigns to spread lies about Biden and corruption in Ukraine as part of Russia's efforts to help Trump.[\[66\]](#cite_note-66)
[\[67\]](#cite_note-67)

### American media involvement

American media organizations with ties to the Trump campaign were involved in the spread of the false allegations.[\[25\]](#cite_note-Mayer-2019-25)
 Specifically [Peter Schweizer](/wiki/Peter_Schweizer "Peter Schweizer")
,[\[68\]](#cite_note-68)

 and [One America News Network](/wiki/One_America_News_Network "One America News Network")
[\[70\]](#cite_note-oan_atlantic-70)
 were essential in creating and disseminating the lies that built the background for this conspiracy theory.

#### Peter Schweizer

[Peter Schweizer](/wiki/Peter_Schweizer "Peter Schweizer")
, editor-at-large at _[Breitbart News](/wiki/Breitbart_News "Breitbart News")

 The plagiarized book[\[71\]](#cite_note-71)
 included a false story that on January 12, 2017, Joe Biden, who was then the vice-president, sought to end an investigation into Burisma to protect Hunter Biden, who had a profitable post on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company run by a shady oligarch.[\[25\]](#cite_note-Mayer-2019-25)

Schweizer launched a media blitz in 2019 to help the conspiracy spread and appeared and wrote editorials repeating his lie in multiple news outlets.[\[72\]](#cite_note-72)

Biden approves nuclear strategy refocusing on China threat – report
===================================================================

This article is more than 1 year old

White House says plan was approved earlier this year and was not a response to a single country or threat

[Joe Biden](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden)
 has approved a US nuclear strategy to prepare for possible coordinated nuclear confrontations with Russia, China and North Korea, according to a New York Times [report](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/us/politics/biden-nuclear-china-russia.html)
 on Tuesday.

On Tuesday, the White House said the president approved the plan earlier this year and it was not a response to a single country or threat.

The spokesperson Sean Savett said that while “the specific text of the guidance is classified, its existence is in no way secret. “It is possible that we will one day look back and see the quarter-century after the cold war as nuclear intermission.”

Zhou argued that nuclear-armed states should declare a “no first use” policy, as so far only China and India have done.

On Tuesday, the Times reported that two senior administration officials had earlier been permitted to allude to the revision in US nuclear strategy without disclosing its existence.

In June, Pranay Vaddi, a senior director of the national security council, [warned](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/17/row-as-nato-chief-hints-at-talks-to-increase-availability-of-nuclear-weapons)
 that “absent a change” in nuclear strategy by China and Russia, the US was prepared to shift from modernisation of existing weapons to expanding its arsenal.

Vaddi also alluded to the highly classified document, saying it emphasised “the need to deter Russia, the PRC \[People’s Republic of China\] and [North Korea](https://www.theguardian.com/world/north-korea)
 simultaneously”.

China’s president, Xi Jinping, and his US counterpart, Joe Biden, meeting at the G20 summit in Bali, Indonesia, in November 2022. The Russian president, [Vladimir Putin](https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin)
, has [threatened](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/21/russia-begins-tactical-nuclear-weapon-drills-near-ukraine-border)
 to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine.

China’s foreign ministry on Wednesday said that it was “seriously concerned” by the reports and accused the US of “stirring up the so-called ‘China nuclear threat theory’”. But China’s arsenal is thought to be expanding at a much faster pace than any other country’s.

The US-based Arms Control Association said it understood US nuclear weapons strategy and posture remained the same as described in the administration’s 2022 nuclear posture review, and there had been no reorientation away from [Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia)
 and toward China.

Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association, said that while US intelligence estimates suggested China might increase the size of its nuclear arsenal from 500 to 1,000 warheads by 2030, Russia currently had about 4,000 nuclear warheads “and it remains the major driver behind US nuclear strategy”.

Biden approved the revised strategy – called the nuclear employment guidance – in March, according to the Times, but an unclassified notification of the policy change has not yet been presented to Congress.

After years of nuclear arms reduction efforts, the administration has been signalling willingness to expand the US arsenal to counter China and Russia’s nuclear strategies more recently. Last month, Chinese and Russian long-range bombers patrolled together near Alaska for the first time and held live-fire exercises in the South China Sea.

The second US administration official permitted to refer to the document, Vipin Narang, an MIT nuclear strategist who served in the Pentagon, said earlier this month that Biden had “issued updated nuclear weapons employment guidance to account for multiple nuclear-armed adversaries” and for “the significant increase in the size and diversity” of China’s nuclear arsenal.

“It is our responsibility to see the world as it is, not as we hoped or wished it would be,” the Times quoted Narang as saying. The guidance issued earlier this year is not a response to any single entity, country, nor threat.”

The Times reported that the deterrent policy takes into account a rapid buildup of [China’s nuclear arsenal](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/20/china-expanding-nuclear-arsenal-much-faster-than-predicted-us-report-says)
, which will rival the size and diversity of the US and Russian stockpiles over the next decade. In February, the US [warned](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/feb/14/mike-turner-national-security-threat)
 allies that Russia could be planning to put a nuclear weapon into space.

On Tuesday, a retired senior colonel in the Chinese People’s Liberation Army, Zhou Bo, [published a piece](https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/08/20/nuclear-weapons-war-no-first-use-policy/)
 in Foreign Policy arguing that the US and China could still cooperate on nuclear diplomacy."

What Biden has done on nuclear policy while in office
-----------------------------------------------------

Biden’s most important nuclear achievement has been successfully deterring Russian nuclear escalation over the war in Ukraine: Russia has not used nuclear weapons against NATO members or against Ukraine itself. Indeed, the treaty is still standing only because Biden quickly negotiated an [extension](https://www.state.gov/on-the-extension-of-the-new-start-treaty-with-the-russian-federation/)
 during his first weeks in office, and the administration has expressed [continued](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2022-12/news/bidens-nuclear-posture-straddles-obama-trump-policies)
 interest in strategic arms control if it can find a willing partner in Moscow.

The Biden administration has also worked to stabilize relations with China, a country whose nuclear arsenal is undergoing a rapid [expansion](https://media.defense.gov/2023/Oct/19/2003323409/-1/-1/1/2023-MILITARY-AND-SECURITY-DEVELOPMENTS-INVOLVING-THE-PEOPLES-REPUBLIC-OF-CHINA.PDF)
. These differences matter because of the enormous presidential latitude with respect to nuclear decision-making, including presidents’ [sole authority](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/natsec/IF10521.pdf)
 to launch nuclear weapons without authorization from other parts of the government.

While in office, Trump was often confrontational in his dealings with other nuclear powers and was openly skeptical of the alliance relationships that depend on U.S. While valuing a robust deterrent, Biden also has a long-standing commitment to arms control.

What Trump did on nuclear policy while in office
------------------------------------------------

Trump’s [decision](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j-trump-ending-united-states-participation-unacceptable-iran-deal/)
 to renege on the Iran nuclear deal—despite the [State Department](https://2017-2021.state.gov/briefings/department-press-briefing-july-18-2017/)
 certifying that Iran was complying with its terms—was likely the most significant nuclear policy decision of his time in office. In fact, North Korea significantly expanded and improved its nuclear arsenal on Trump’s watch, gaining the [ability](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/north-korea-fires-ballistic-missile-south-korea-says-2023-12-17/)
 to hit the continental United States with a nuclear-tipped ballistic missile.

Furthermore, Trump actively stoked a dangerous nuclear crisis with North Korea in the period leading up to the summit. At another point, he [tweeted](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/948355557022420992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E948355557022420992%7Ctwgr%5E8f3c7c895f959526a3e4adcaae7b41e23ea14eba%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2018%2F01%2F02%2Fpolitics%2Fdonald-trump-north-korea-nuclear%2Findex.html)
 of Kim, “Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!” Trump was later [revealed](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-discussed-using-nuclear-weapon-north-korea-2017-blaming-someone-rcna65120)
 to have privately considered using a nuclear weapon against North Korea while falsely blaming it on another country.

Finally, the Trump administration was highly skeptical of arms control with other nuclear powers. China’s nuclear arsenal is expanding as it becomes increasingly [confrontational](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/china-starts-military-drills-around-taiwan-days-after-new-president-takes-office-2024-05-23/#:~:text=China%20launched%20military%20drills%20around,of%20high%2Dvalue%20military%20targets.)
 toward Taiwan. This is in significant part because Biden has effectively [communicated](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/31/opinion/biden-ukraine-strategy.html)
 that the United States will defend NATO, and also that it would respond forcefully (though almost certainly [not](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/will-biden-putin-goes-nuclear-experts-say-nuclear-response-unlikely-no-rcna32756)
 with nuclear weapons) to Russian nuclear use in Ukraine. For example, it has ([mostly](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/24/us-long-range-missiles-ukraine-00154110)
) constrained Ukraine’s ability to conduct longer-range attacks on Russian territory with U.S.-supplied weapons.

Furthermore, the Biden administration has taken steps to stabilize the overall strategic nuclear relationship with Russia. It has also fortified the defense relationship with South Korea through the [Washington Declaration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/04/26/washington-declaration-2/)
, which will engage the two countries more closely on nuclear deterrence matters.

What Biden might do on nuclear policy if reelected
--------------------------------------------------

As with Trump, Biden’s first term in office provides useful guidance as to his likely nuclear policy priorities were he to be reelected."

Content: "plan approved by President Joe Biden in March was to prepare for possible coordinated nuclear confrontations with Russia, China and North Korea.

The highly classified plan for the first time reorients Washington's deterrent strategy to focus on China's rapid expansion in its nuclear arsenal, the _Times_ said.

KCNA said North Korea's foreign ministry "expresses serious concern over and bitterly denounces and rejects the behavior of the U.S."

It added North Korea vowed to push forward the building of nuclear force sufficient and reliable enough to firmly defend its sovereignty.

Pyongyang and Moscow have been allies since North Korea's founding after World War II and have drawn even closer since Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

The United States and Seoul have accused North Korea of providing ammunition and missiles to Russia for its war in Ukraine.

Pyongyang, which has declared itself an "irreversible" nuclear weapons power, has described allegations of supplying weapons to Russia as "absurd."

However, it did thank Russia for using its United Nations veto in March to effectively end monitoring of sanctions violations just as UN experts were starting to probe alleged arms transfers.

China, also a key ally of North Korea, presents itself as a neutral party in Russia's offensive on Ukraine and says it is not sending lethal assistance to either side, unlike the United States and other Western nations.

But it is a close political and economic ally of Russia, and NATO members have branded Beijing a "decisive enabler" of the war.

Moscow has looked to Beijing as an economic lifeline since the Ukraine conflict began, with the two boosting trade to record highs as Russia faces heavy sanctions from the West.

## Claim
Claim: "While serving as US President in 2024, Joe Biden ordered the US forces to prepare for possible nuclear confrontations with Russia, China, and North Korea."

## Actions
```
web_search("Joe Biden US President nuclear confrontation Russia China North Korea")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Guardian reports that Joe Biden approved a US nuclear strategy to prepare for possible nuclear confrontations with Russia, China, and North Korea (<image:13749>). The White House stated that the plan was approved earlier this year and was not a response to a single country or threat. The Voice of America (VOA) published an article on August 24, 2024, reporting that North Korea condemned a new U.S. nuclear strategic plan, approved by President Joe Biden in March, to prepare for possible coordinated nuclear confrontations with Russia, China, and North Korea (<image:13758>).

The Brookings article discusses Biden's nuclear policy while in office, mentioning that Biden successfully deterred Russian nuclear escalation in the war in Ukraine and has worked to stabilize relations with China. The article also mentions that Biden has taken steps to stabilize the overall strategic nuclear relationship with Russia.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Joe Biden, while serving as US President, approved a nuclear strategy to prepare for possible nuclear confrontations with Russia, China, and North Korea. The Guardian and VOA both report on this, with the latter specifying that the plan was approved in March 2024. The Brookings article also discusses Biden's nuclear policy.

The White House stated that the plan was not a response to a single country or threat.

Some open-source estimates suggest that Ukraine had already lost nearly 40 Leopards, but those estimates are unconfirmed so far, according to the report. Russia repeatedly stated that arms supplies to Ukraine hinder the settlement and directly involve NATO countries in the conflict. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that the United States and NATO were directly involved in the conflict not only by providing weapons but also by training Ukrainian personnel in European countries.

"Leopard tanks and Bradley infantry fighting vehicles. These are our trophies. Equipment of the Ukrainian armed forces in the Zaporizhzhia region," the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement.

"Servicemen of the Vostok group inspect enemy tanks and infantry fighting vehicles captured in battle."

Kyiv has appealed to its allies in the West to deliver a broad range of modern military equipment to help Ukrainian forces recapture large swathes of territory controlled by Russian forces.

The Defense Ministry said several of the captured vehicles had working engines, suggesting that the battles they were involved in had been short and that Ukrainian troops had "fled" their offensive positions.

**(DEFENCE SECURITY ASIA) — During the week of May 11 to 17, Russian military claimed to have successfully destroyed five Leopard 2A1 tanks, manufactured by the German company Krauss-Maffei but donated to the Ukrainian Armed Forces to help the Eastern Europe country in its armed conflict with Russia.**

**In addition to the Leopard tanks, the Russian Ministry of Defense also alleged that 13 armored vehicles, 55 various vehicles, “Grad” multiple rocket launcher systems, and 47 artillery units—22 of which were supplied by foreign countries—were destroyed during this period.**

**Moreover, four Mi-24 helicopters and 40 unmanned boats belonging to the Ukrainian military were reportedly destroyed by Russia in the same timeframe.**

**Among the foreign-supplied armored vehicles to Ukraine, the Leopard tanks have been the most frequently supplied to Kyiv compared to other models such as the American-made Abrams and the British-made Challengers.**

**Since last year, countries such as Germany and several other European nations have supplied between 100-200 Leopard tanks to Ukraine for use in a spring counteroffensive against Russian positions.**

**“Russian Soldiers Pose in Front of Captured Leopard 2A6 Tank”**

**Line of Leopard tanks and Bradley armoured infantry fighting vehicle were destroyed in Zaphorizia, southern Ukraine.**

**Although the Ukrainian counteroffensive in 2023 initially started well, it faced increasingly formidable opposition from Russian forces who began altering their tactics and strategies.**

**These changes in strategy and tactics by the Russian forces led to the destruction of many of the Ukrainian tanks that had been supplied by donor countries like Germany, other European nations, the United States, and Britain.**

**However, to date, no one knows exactly how many Leopard tanks have been destroyed by Russia.**

**Nevertheless, Russian President Vladimir Putin has reportedly stated to his country’s war correspondents that Ukraine has lost more than 160 tanks supplied by foreign countries.**

**Given the high volume of Leopard tanks supplied to Ukraine, it is logical to conclude that many of the tanks destroyed by Russia were Leopard models.**

**Regarding the Abrams tanks, the Russian military stated that of the 31 American-made tanks supplied to Ukraine, more than five of the tanks have been destroyed by Russian forces.**

**A charred M1A1 Abrams main battle tank being transported to Moscow to participate in an exhibition at Victory Park.**

 **As a result of the destruction of five Abrams tanks, the United States has reportedly “withdrawn” these tanks from the Ukrainian battlefield, likely in an effort to “preserve its reputation.”**

**Following the destruction experienced by Leopard tanks supplied by Germany and other European countries, Ukraine’s Deputy Foreign Minister Andii Melnyk has requested that Kiev be supplied with more Leopard tanks, including the latest variant, the Leopard 2A6.**

 **However, the newest Leopard 2A6 variant supplied to Ukraine has met the same fate.**

**The Russian military reported capturing the most powerful tank in the Ukrainian arsenal, the German-made Leopard 2A6, after intense fighting in Avdiivka, Ukraine, last April.**

**It is believed that Ukraine possesses 21 Leopard 2A6 tanks, with 18 of these tanks developed by the companies Krauss-Maffei Wegmann and Rheinmetall being donated by Germany, while the remainder were provided by Portugal.**

**However, most of these Leopard 2A6 tanks donated to the Ukrainian military could not be used after failing to be properly maintained and remained inoperable as claimed by a senior German politician last January.**

**An Abrams tank caught fire after being struck by a Lancet kamikaze drone and an RPG from Russian forces.**

**According to Russian military sources, after capturing and removing the tank from the combat area, Russian forces transported the tank and sent it to Moscow, possibly for research purposes.**

**The Leopard 2A6 was successfully captured after a Russian platoon executed an ambush that caused the Ukrainian tank crew to abandon the German-made vehicle.**

**The Leopard 2A6 represents an upgrade from the Leopard 2A5, incorporating enhanced armor protection, firepower, and electronic warfare capabilities.**

**The tank measures 9.97 meters in length and weighs 62.3 tons, making it one of the heaviest main battle tanks ever deployed, with an engine power of 1,500 horsepower.**

**Capable of speeds up to 75 km/h and with an operational range of 500 km, it is equipped with a Rheinmetall 120 mm L/55 cannon, allowing it to fire all standard NATO ammunition types, including APFSDS, HEAT, and multi-purpose shells.**

**The Leopard 2A6 also features dual 7.62 mm MG3A1 machine guns and an advanced fire control system including a laser rangefinder, thermal imaging, and a ballistic computer. — DSA**

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that the image depicts destroyed tanks, likely Leopard tanks, in the context of the conflict in Ukraine. The image has been used in articles discussing the loss or capture of tanks and other military equipment in Ukraine. However, the evidence does not specify the exact location or date of the events depicted in the image.

The claim states that the image shows destroyed Ukrainian tanks during Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024. The evidence does not support this specific claim. The articles mentioning the image do not mention any incursion into Kursk Oblast or the date August 2024.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.

Claim: "<image:26> This image shows destroyed Ukrainian tanks during Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024."

## Actions
```

```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:26> appears in multiple articles discussing the conflict in Ukraine. One article from Sputnik Africa, published on October 17, 2024, reports that Ukraine has lost around 40 Leopard tanks since February 2022, and includes the image. The Moscow Times published an article on June 13, 2023, stating that Russia had captured German Leopard tanks and U.S. Bradley infantry fighting vehicles in the Zaporizhzhia region, also including the image.

Another article from Defence Security Asia, published on May 19, 2024, discusses the destruction of German-made Leopard tanks in Ukraine and includes the image <image:26>. The article also mentions the destruction of other military equipment.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the image depicts destroyed tanks, likely Leopard tanks, in the context of the conflict in Ukraine. The image has been used in articles discussing the loss or capture of tanks and other military equipment in Ukraine. However, the evidence does not specify the exact location or date of the events depicted in the image.

The claim states that the image shows destroyed Ukrainian tanks during Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024. The evidence does not support this specific claim. The articles mentioning the image do not mention any incursion into Kursk Oblast or the date August 2024.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The image depicts destroyed tanks, likely Leopard tanks, in the context of the conflict in Ukraine. However, the claim that the image shows destroyed Ukrainian tanks during Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024 is not supported by the evidence. The provided articles do not mention any incursion into Kursk Oblast or the date August 2024. `false`
