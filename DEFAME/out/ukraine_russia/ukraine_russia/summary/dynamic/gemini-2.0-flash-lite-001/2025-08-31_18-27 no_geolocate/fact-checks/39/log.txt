The claim 'After InfoWars reporter Jamie White was shot dead on March 10, 2025 in Austin, Texas, it was revelaed that he was on a Ukranian enemies hit list.' is false.
Justification: The claim that Jamie White was on a Ukrainian enemies hit list is not definitively supported by evidence. While some sources, including Alex Jones, suggest this, and White himself believed he was on such a list, there is no conclusive proof. Other sources, such as [StopFake](https://www.stopfake.org/en/fake-infowars-journalist-murdered-shortly-after-ukraine-put-him-on-their-kill-list/), dispute this, and White's sister and local police believe his death was unrelated to his journalistic activities.

So, the overall veracity is: false
