## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results discuss allegations of corruption and the laundering of US aid to Ukraine. One source, from Wikipedia, discusses the 2019 Trump–Ukraine scandal, including allegations of withholding aid and requests for investigations into Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Trump%E2%80%93Ukraine_scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Trump%E2%80%93Ukraine_scandal)). Newsweek published an article discussing the claim that Ukraine sent billions of dollars from foreign aid to FTX, which was then sent back to the Democratic party, stating that the claim originated from social media posts and was spread by right-leaning commentators ([https://www.newsweek.com/what-behind-claim-joe-biden-laundered-billions-ukraine-aid-via-ftx-1759774](https://www.newsweek.com/what-behind-claim-joe-biden-laundered-billions-ukraine-aid-via-ftx-1759774)). The Associated Press published a fact check stating that the claim "Half of all US aid to Ukraine was laundered and sent back to Democrat candidates for re-election" is false ([https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-ftx-ukraine-democrats-laundering-996663874380](https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-ftx-ukraine-democrats-laundering-996663874380)). The Newsweek article includes an image of Joe Biden and Sam Bankman-Fried ![image 2147](media/2025-08-07_20-01-1754596899-160228.jpg).


### Evidence from `web_search`
The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) provides a fact sheet on US assistance to Ukraine, stating that US oversight of aid is extensive and that the US is not giving more support to Ukraine than Europe. The document also states that the US is not sending Ukraine a "blank check" and that sending military aid to Ukraine increases America’s military readiness.

The BBC reports that Ukraine's security service has uncovered corruption in an arms purchase by the military worth about $40m. [Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68120973). ![image 8708](media/2025-08-30_09-10-1756545011-367799.jpg)


## Elaboration
The Associated Press fact-check explicitly states that the claim is false ([https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-ftx-ukraine-democrats-laundering-996663874380](https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-ftx-ukraine-democrats-laundering-996663874380)). The Newsweek article indicates that the claim originated from social media and was spread by right-leaning commentators ([https://www.newsweek.com/what-behind-claim-joe-biden-laundered-billions-ukraine-aid-via-ftx-1759774](https://www.newsweek.com/what-behind-claim-joe-biden-laundered-billions-ukraine-aid-via-ftx-1759774)). The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) states that the US oversight of aid is extensive.

The BBC reports on corruption in Ukraine's arms purchases, but this does not directly support the claim.


## Final Judgement
The claim that half of all US aid to Ukraine was laundered and sent back to Democrat candidates for re-election is demonstrably false. Multiple sources, including the Associated Press, have debunked this claim. The evidence indicates that the claim originated from social media and was spread by right-leaning commentators.

`false`
