## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that there have been reports of incidents involving Vladimir Putin's limousines, including a fire and an explosion. However, none of the provided sources confirm that Putin died in an explosion. The reports mention speculation about assassination attempts and rumors about Putin's health, but they do not confirm the claim.

The claim cannot be verified with the available information. The evidence only confirms that there were incidents involving Putin's limousines, but not his death.

To verify the claim, information about Putin's death would be needed.
