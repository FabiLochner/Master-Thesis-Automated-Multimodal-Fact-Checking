**Armed Forces Day**, known also as the **Feast of the Polish Armed Forces** ([Polish](/wiki/Polish_language "Polish language")
: _Święto Wojska Polskiego_), is a national holiday celebrated annually on 15 August in Poland, commemorating the anniversary of the 1920 victory over [Soviet Russia](/wiki/Russian_Soviet_Federative_Socialist_Republic "Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic")
 at the [Battle of Warsaw](/wiki/Battle_of_Warsaw_(1920) "Battle of Warsaw (1920)")
 during the [Polish–Soviet War](/wiki/Polish%E2%80%93Soviet_War "Polish–Soviet War")
.[\[1\]](#cite_note-PolskieRadio2013-1)
 Armed Forces Day is held in conjunction with the [Day of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary](/wiki/Assumption_of_Mary "Assumption of Mary")
, itself a separate public holiday.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Kontakt24-2)
 The event is marked by [military parades](/wiki/Military_parade "Military parade")
, equipment reviews, showcases and remembrances by all branches of the [Polish Armed Forces](/wiki/Polish_Armed_Forces "Polish Armed Forces")
 across the country. To commemorate the republic's victory over the Red Army, Minister of Military Affairs [Stanisław Szeptycki](/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Szeptycki "Stanisław Szeptycki")
 established the Feast of the Soldier (_Święta Żołnierza_), or Soldiers Day, in 1923.[\[4\]](#cite_note-4)
 In proclaiming the holiday, Szeptycki declared that, "\[o\]n the anniversary of the memorable defeat of the Bolshevik onslaught on Warsaw, we honor the memory of those killed in battles with enemies throughout all ages and for Polish independence."[\[5\]](#cite_note-Museum-5)
 The date of 15 August was chosen as it coincided with the [21st Mountain Division's](/wiki/21st_Mountain_Infantry_Division_(Poland) "21st Mountain Infantry Division (Poland)")
 evening counterattack on Russian troops, eventually forcing the Red Army's general retreat.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Kontakt24-2)
 Additionally, the government of the Second Republic desired the military's greater integration with the new state, as well as for the armed forces to improve its image among the civilian public.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Kontakt24-2)

The Feast of the Soldier remained a celebrated holiday until 1947, when the newly installed communist government of the [People's Republic of Poland](/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_Poland "People's Republic of Poland")
 discontinued the tradition.[\[6\]](#cite_note-Gazeta2013-6)
 In 1950, the [Council of Ministers](/wiki/Cabinet_of_Poland "Cabinet of Poland")
 under Prime Minister [Józef Cyrankiewicz](/wiki/J%C3%B3zef_Cyrankiewicz "Józef Cyrankiewicz")
 passed regulations to officially celebrate the military on 12 October.[\[7\]](#cite_note-DzU1950-7)
 Renaming the celebration as Polish Armed Forces Day (_Dzień Wojska Polskiego_), the day marked the anniversary of the Soviet-organized [Polish 1st Tadeusz Kościuszko Infantry Division](/wiki/Polish_1st_Tadeusz_Ko%C5%9Bciuszko_Infantry_Division "Polish 1st Tadeusz Kościuszko Infantry Division")
 engaging [German](/wiki/Nazi_Germany "Nazi Germany")
 units at the [Battle of Lenino](/wiki/Battle_of_Lenino "Battle of Lenino")
 in October 1943.[\[7\]](#cite_note-DzU1950-7)
 The communist government found it impossible to celebrate the original date of 15 August and its coinciding historical significance, owing to its glorification of the [Red Army](/wiki/Red_Army "Red Army")
's defeat.[\[8\]](#cite_note-PolskieRadio2012-8)
 Following the return of democracy in the wake of the [events of 1989](/wiki/Revolutions_of_1989 "Revolutions of 1989")
, the [Sejm](/wiki/Sejm "Sejm")
 approved the restoration of Armed Forces Day to the original 15 August date and meaning on 30 July 1992, repealing the earlier communist era 1950 declaration.[\[9\]](#cite_note-Sejm1992-9)

This year’s parade on August 15 will be an expression of "strength, agency and unity" in the face of "threats from the East," Defence Minister Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz has said.

Speaking during a rehearsal ahead of the Armed Forces Day parade in Warsaw, Kosiniak-Kamysz encouraged the public to celebrate the anniversary of Poland's "great victory" over the Russian Bolsheviks at the 1920 Battle of Warsaw.

"Our presence will be an expression of gratitude to past generations and hope for future ones," he said.

"It will also show our strength, agency and unity in the face of threats from the East," he added.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Associated Press reported on a Polish military parade in Warsaw on August 15, 2024, for Armed Forces Day, which included over 2,500 troops and military vehicles. The parade was also mentioned in an article by Polish Radio on August 12, 2024, which stated that the parade would take place on August 15 and showcase military hardware, including South Korean-made K2 battle tanks and US-made M1A1 Abrams tanks. The parade was described as an expression of strength in the face of threats from the East. <image:25>

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that a military parade did take place in Poland on August 15, 2024, not August 14, as stated in the claim. The parade was held for Armed Forces Day and included military vehicles. The evidence also suggests that the parade was a display of strength, possibly in response to external threats.

The claim that the parade was preparing for war with Russia is not directly supported by the evidence. While the parade was described as an expression of strength in the face of threats from the East, this does not explicitly mean it was preparing for war.

The evidence does not provide enough information to verify the claim's veracity.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate.

For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion.

The claim that the parade was preparing for war with Russia is not directly supported by the evidence. While the parade was described as an expression of strength in the face of threats from the East, this does not explicitly mean it was preparing for war.

The evidence does not provide enough information to verify the claim's veracity.


## Final Judgement
The image is of a Polish military parade that took place on August 15, 2024, not August 14, as stated in the claim. The parade was held for Armed Forces Day and included military vehicles. The evidence does not support the claim that the parade was preparing for war with Russia.

`false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image depicts a Polish military parade that occurred on August 15, 2024, as reported by the Associated Press and Polish Radio, not on August 14 as the claim states. The parade was held for Armed Forces Day and showcased military hardware. While the parade was described as a display of strength, there is no evidence to support the claim that it was specifically preparing for war with Russia.

Some open-source estimates suggest that Ukraine had already lost nearly 40 Leopards, but those estimates are unconfirmed so far, according to the report. Russia repeatedly stated that arms supplies to Ukraine hinder the settlement and directly involve NATO countries in the conflict. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that the United States and NATO were directly involved in the conflict not only by providing weapons but also by training Ukrainian personnel in European countries.

MOSCOW (Sputnik) - Ukraine has lost around 40 Leopard tanks since the beginning of Russia's special military operation in February 2022, the Business Insider news outlet reported on Thursday.

Ukrainian Armed Forces destroyed in the Zaporozhye direction. Russian Defence Ministry / TASS

Moscow said Tuesday that it had captured several German Leopard tanks and U.S. Bradley infantry fighting vehicles, releasing footage showing Russian troops surveying the equipment supplied to Ukraine by Western countries.

"Leopard tanks and Bradley infantry fighting vehicles. These are our trophies. Equipment of the Ukrainian armed forces in the Zaporizhzhia region," the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement.

"Servicemen of the Vostok group inspect enemy tanks and infantry fighting vehicles captured in battle."

Kyiv has appealed to its allies in the West to deliver a broad range of modern military equipment to help Ukrainian forces recapture large swathes of territory controlled by Russian forces.

The Defense Ministry said several of the captured vehicles had working engines, suggesting that the battles they were involved in had been short and that Ukrainian troops had "fled" their offensive positions.

**(DEFENCE SECURITY ASIA) — During the week of May 11 to 17, Russian military claimed to have successfully destroyed five Leopard 2A1 tanks, manufactured by the German company Krauss-Maffei but donated to the Ukrainian Armed Forces to help the Eastern Europe country in its armed conflict with Russia.**

**In addition to the Leopard tanks, the Russian Ministry of Defense also alleged that 13 armored vehicles, 55 various vehicles, “Grad” multiple rocket launcher systems, and 47 artillery units—22 of which were supplied by foreign countries—were destroyed during this period.**

**Moreover, four Mi-24 helicopters and 40 unmanned boats belonging to the Ukrainian military were reportedly destroyed by Russia in the same timeframe.**

**Among the foreign-supplied armored vehicles to Ukraine, the Leopard tanks have been the most frequently supplied to Kyiv compared to other models such as the American-made Abrams and the British-made Challengers.**

**Since last year, countries such as Germany and several other European nations have supplied between 100-200 Leopard tanks to Ukraine for use in a spring counteroffensive against Russian positions.**

**“Russian Soldiers Pose in Front of Captured Leopard 2A6 Tank”**

**Line of Leopard tanks and Bradley armoured infantry fighting vehicle were destroyed in Zaphorizia, southern Ukraine.**

**Although the Ukrainian counteroffensive in 2023 initially started well, it faced increasingly formidable opposition from Russian forces who began altering their tactics and strategies.**

**These changes in strategy and tactics by the Russian forces led to the destruction of many of the Ukrainian tanks that had been supplied by donor countries like Germany, other European nations, the United States, and Britain.**

**However, to date, no one knows exactly how many Leopard tanks have been destroyed by Russia.**

**Nevertheless, Russian President Vladimir Putin has reportedly stated to his country’s war correspondents that Ukraine has lost more than 160 tanks supplied by foreign countries.**

**Given the high volume of Leopard tanks supplied to Ukraine, it is logical to conclude that many of the tanks destroyed by Russia were Leopard models.**

**Regarding the Abrams tanks, the Russian military stated that of the 31 American-made tanks supplied to Ukraine, more than five of the tanks have been destroyed by Russian forces.**

**A charred M1A1 Abrams main battle tank being transported to Moscow to participate in an exhibition at Victory Park.**

 **As a result of the destruction of five Abrams tanks, the United States has reportedly “withdrawn” these tanks from the Ukrainian battlefield, likely in an effort to “preserve its reputation.”**

**Following the destruction experienced by Leopard tanks supplied by Germany and other European countries, Ukraine’s Deputy Foreign Minister Andii Melnyk has requested that Kiev be supplied with more Leopard tanks, including the latest variant, the Leopard 2A6.**

 **However, the newest Leopard 2A6 variant supplied to Ukraine has met the same fate.**

**The Russian military reported capturing the most powerful tank in the Ukrainian arsenal, the German-made Leopard 2A6, after intense fighting in Avdiivka, Ukraine, last April.**

**It is believed that Ukraine possesses 21 Leopard 2A6 tanks, with 18 of these tanks developed by the companies Krauss-Maffei Wegmann and Rheinmetall being donated by Germany, while the remainder were provided by Portugal.**

**However, most of these Leopard 2A6 tanks donated to the Ukrainian military could not be used after failing to be properly maintained and remained inoperable as claimed by a senior German politician last January.**

**An Abrams tank caught fire after being struck by a Lancet kamikaze drone and an RPG from Russian forces.**

**According to Russian military sources, after capturing and removing the tank from the combat area, Russian forces transported the tank and sent it to Moscow, possibly for research purposes.**

**The Leopard 2A6 was successfully captured after a Russian platoon executed an ambush that caused the Ukrainian tank crew to abandon the German-made vehicle.**

**The Leopard 2A6 represents an upgrade from the Leopard 2A5, incorporating enhanced armor protection, firepower, and electronic warfare capabilities.**

**The tank measures 9.97 meters in length and weighs 62.3 tons, making it one of the heaviest main battle tanks ever deployed, with an engine power of 1,500 horsepower.**

**Capable of speeds up to 75 km/h and with an operational range of 500 km, it is equipped with a Rheinmetall 120 mm L/55 cannon, allowing it to fire all standard NATO ammunition types, including APFSDS, HEAT, and multi-purpose shells.**

**The Leopard 2A6 also features dual 7.62 mm MG3A1 machine guns and an advanced fire control system including a laser rangefinder, thermal imaging, and a ballistic computer. — DSA**

Ukraine's top general, Oleksandr Syrskyi, insists that Ukrainian forces have pulled back to "more favourable positions", remain in Kursk, and would do so "for as long as it is expedient and necessary".

He said Russia had suffered more than 50,000 losses during the operation - including those killed, injured or captured.

However, the situation now is very different to last August. <image:9796>!Getty Images A Ukrainian soldier comforts a comrade during fighting in Kursk <image:9797>Getty Images

A Ukrainian soldier comforts a comrade during fighting in Kursk

Ukrainian soldiers fighting in Russia's Kursk region have described scenes "like a horror movie" as they retreated from the front lines.

The BBC has received extensive accounts from Ukrainian troops, who recount a "catastrophic" withdrawal in the face of heavy fire, and columns of military equipment destroyed and constant attacks from swarms of Russian drones.

The soldiers, who spoke over social media, were given aliases to protect their identity. But this again came as a surprise to our command."

At the time of writing, just before Russia retook Sudzha, Volodymyr said Ukrainian forces were being pressed from three sides.

Maksym: Vehicle wrecks litter the roads
---------------------------------------

By 11 March, Ukrainian forces were battling to prevent the road being cut, according to Telegram messages from "Maksym".

"A few days ago, we received an order to leave the defence lines in an organised retreat," he said, adding that Russia had amassed a significant force to retake the town, "including large numbers of North Korean soldiers".

Military experts estimate Russia had amassed a force of up to 70,000 troops to retake Kursk – including about 12,000 North Koreans.

Russia had also sent its best drone units to the front and was using kamikaze and first-person-view (FPV) variants to "take fire control of the main logistics routes".

They included drones linked to operators by fibre-optic wires - which are impossible to jam with electronic counter-measures.

Maksym said as a result "the enemy managed to destroy dozens of units of equipment", and that wrecks had "created congestion on supply routes".

! They were some of their best-trained soldiers, equipped with Western-supplied weapons including tanks and armoured vehicles.

Russian bloggers published videos showing some of that equipment being destroyed or captured. Military analysts estimate two-thirds of the 1,000 sq km gained at the outset have since been lost.

Any hopes that Ukraine would be able to trade Kursk territory for some of its own have significantly diminished.

Last week, President Volodymyr Zelensky said he believed the Kursk operation had "accomplished its task" by forcing Russia to pull troops from the east and relieve pressure on Pokrovsk.

But it is not yet clear at what cost.

One-way attack drones and other Ukrainian weapons have destroyed thousands of Russian tanks in the past year as well as thousands of other platforms, according to the commander of U.S. Thousands of tanks destroyed on both sides,” Cavoli said.

At the start of the full-scale war in February 2022, Russia had about 13,000 tanks on active status and in storage, according to Cavoli.

“They’re starting to approach near the end of … the useful tanks in storage. So, depending on how much more they lose, that will really determine how quickly they can regenerate,” he told lawmakers.

“Russian ground forces in Ukraine have lost an estimated 3,000 tanks, 9,000 armored vehicles, 13,000 artillery systems, and over 400 air defense systems in the past year,” Cavoli said in a written statement to the committee.

However, Moscow is on pace to replace those losses, he added, noting that it has expanded its industrial production, opened new manufacturing facilities, and converted commercial production lines for military purposes.

“As a result, the Russian defense industrial base is expected to roll out 1,500 tanks, 3,000 armored vehicles, and 200 Iskander ballistic and cruise missiles this year. (Comparatively, the United States only produces about 135 tanks per year and no longer produces new Bradley Fighting Vehicles.) Additionally, we anticipate Russia to produce 250,000 artillery shells per month, which puts it on track to build a stockpile three times greater than the United States and Europe combined,” Cavoli wrote.

Cavoli did not provide comparative figures for Ukraine’s equipment losses and weapons production.

Moscow’s production capability for some items, such as artillery shells and cruise missiles, has expanded “tremendously,” and it’s building one-way attack drones “in prodigious numbers,” he told senators, noting that Russian ground forces are integrating reconnaissance and kamikaze drones into their offensive operations on the battlefield.

Ukraine has used a variety of weapons — including unmanned aerial systems, artillery and Javelin missiles, among others — to destroy Russian tanks and other equipment.

Cavoli noted that both sides in the conflict are also conducting long-range attacks, with the Russians deploying cruise missiles and glide bombs and the Ukrainians relying mainly on one-way attack drones.

Ukraine is also using “some indigenously produced cruise missile systems — one in particular that I’ve got in mind that we can talk about in closed session,” Cavoli told SASC members.

The U.S. has [provided large quantities](https://defensescoop.com/2025/01/14/ukraine-drones-uas-biden-administration-security-assistance-final-rundown/)
 of UAS — including kamikaze drones such as Switchblades and the Phoenix Ghost family of systems — to Kyiv since the war began to help it counter Russia’s invasion.

However, Ukraine’s defense industry has ramped up and is producing many of its own munitions.

“I would say they’re the world leaders in one-attack drone technology,” Cavoli told lawmakers.

President Donald Trump, noting the heavy losses on both sides of the conflict, has been pressuring Ukraine to reach a peace deal with Russia.

Meanwhile, the U.S. 10, 2024. 5, 2024."

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kursk_campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kursk_campaign)) discusses the 2024 Kursk offensive, which began on August 6, 2024, as part of the Russo-Ukrainian War. The article mentions the involvement of Ukrainian forces entering Russia's Kursk Oblast, leading to clashes, the involvement of Ukrainian brigades, the capture of territory, and casualties on both sides. The BBC article ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0q198zyppqo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0q198zyppqo)) discusses the retreat of Ukrainian troops from the Kursk region and mentions destroyed military equipment. The article includes a map showing the Ukrainian advance in August 2024 and the Russian control in March 2025. <image:26>

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Ukrainian forces entered Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024, leading to clashes and the destruction of military equipment. The BBC article mentions destroyed military equipment, which aligns with the image. However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that the image depicts destroyed Ukrainian tanks. Further visual verification is needed to confirm the type of tanks in the image.

Insufficient information is available to verify the claim.

The **Battle of Kursk**, also called the **Battle of the Kursk Salient**, was a major [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II "World War II")
 [Eastern Front](/wiki/Eastern_Front_(World_War_II) "Eastern Front (World War II)")
 battle between the forces of [Nazi Germany](/wiki/Nazi_Germany "Nazi Germany")
 and the [Soviet Union](/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union")
 near [Kursk](/wiki/Kursk "Kursk")
 in southwestern Russia during the summer of 1943, resulting in a Soviet victory. Because the [Allied invasion of Sicily](/wiki/Allied_invasion_of_Sicily "Allied invasion of Sicily")
 began during the battle, [Adolf Hitler](/wiki/Adolf_Hitler "Adolf Hitler")
 was forced to divert troops training in France to meet the Allied threat in the Mediterranean, rather than using them as a strategic reserve for the Eastern Front.[\[63\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDunn1997191-73)
 As a result, Hitler cancelled the offensive at Kursk after only a week, in part to divert forces to Italy.[\[64\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAtkinson2007172-74)
 Germany's heavy losses of men and tanks ensured that the victorious Soviet [Red Army](/wiki/Red_Army "Red Army")
 held a strategic initiative for the rest of the war. As the challenges offered by Citadel increased, he focused more and more on the expected new weapons that he believed were the key to victory: principally the [Panther tank](/wiki/Panther_tank "Panther tank")
, but also the [Ferdinand](/wiki/Elefant "Elefant")
 [tank destroyer](/wiki/Tank_destroyer "Tank destroyer")
 and greater numbers of the [Tiger](/wiki/Tiger_I "Tiger I")
 heavy tank.[\[57\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTENewton200212-67)
 He postponed the operation in order to await their arrival.[\[113\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEClark2012193-124)
 Receiving reports of powerful Soviet concentrations behind the Kursk area, Hitler further delayed the offensive to allow for more equipment to reach the front.

With pessimism for Citadel increasing with each delay, in June, [Alfred Jodl](/wiki/Alfred_Jodl "Alfred Jodl")
, the Chief of Staff at the OKW, instructed the armed forces propaganda office to portray the upcoming operation as a limited counteroffensive.[\[122\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGlantzHouse200455-135)
[\[118\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGlantz2013183-129)
[\[123\]](#cite_note-136)
 Due to concerns of an Allied landing in the south of France or in Italy and delays in deliveries of the new tanks, Hitler postponed again, this time to 20 June.[\[n\]](#cite_note-Microfilm-137)
 Zeitzler was profoundly concerned with the delays,[\[124\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHealy201083-138)
 but he still supported the offensive.[\[114\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGlantzHouse20041–3-125)
[\[91\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEClark2012186-101)
 On 17–18 June, following a discussion in which the OKW Operations Staff suggested abandoning the offensive, Hitler further postponed the operation until 3 July,[\[122\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGlantzHouse200455-135)
 then, on 1 July, Hitler announced 5 July as the launch date of the offensive.[\[125\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTETaylorKulish1974170-139)

A three-month quiet period had descended upon the Eastern Front as the Soviets prepared their defences and the Germans attempted to build up their forces. However, the force was markedly deficient in infantry divisions, which were essential to hold ground and to secure the flanks.[\[129\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTENewton200225-143)
 By the time the Germans initiated the offensive, their force amounted to around 777,000 men, 2,451 tanks and [assault guns](/wiki/Assault_gun "Assault gun")

In 1943, an offensive by the Soviet Central, Bryansk and Western Fronts against Army Group Centre was abandoned shortly after it began in early March, when the southern flank of the Central Front was threatened by Army Group South.[\[69\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKasdorf20007-79)

 in [Switzerland](/wiki/Switzerland "Switzerland")
. The Soviets verified the intelligence via their spy in Britain, [John Cairncross](/wiki/John_Cairncross "John Cairncross")

 Cairncross also provided Soviet intelligence with identifications of the [Luftwaffe](/wiki/Luftwaffe "Luftwaffe")
 airfields in the region.[\[133\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBeevor2012471-148)
 Soviet politician [Anastas Mikoyan](/wiki/Anastas_Mikoyan "Anastas Mikoyan")
 wrote that on 27 March 1943, Soviet leader [Joseph Stalin](/wiki/Joseph_Stalin "Joseph Stalin")
 notified him of a possible German attack in the Kursk sector.[\[134\]](#cite_note-149)
 Stalin and some senior officers were eager to strike first once the _rasputitsa_ ended,[\[135\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGlantzHouse200428–29mentions_[[Nikolai_Vatutin]]_and_[[Mikhail_Malinin]]-150)
[\[136\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEClark2012189mentions_Stalin-151)
 but a number of key officers, including Deputy Supreme Commander [Georgiy Zhukov](/wiki/Georgiy_Zhukov "Georgiy Zhukov")
, recommended a strategic defensive before going on the offensive. In a letter to the _[Stavka](/wiki/Stavka "Stavka")
_ and Stalin, on 8 April, Zhukov wrote:

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The reverse image search found the image in multiple sources. One source, from Sputnik Africa, published on October 17, 2024, reports that Ukraine has lost around 40 Leopard tanks since February 2022. The Moscow Times published an article on June 13, 2023, stating that Russia had captured German Leopard tanks in the Zaporizhzhia region. Defence Security Asia, published on May 19, 2024, discusses the destruction of Leopard tanks in Ukraine. None of the sources mention Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024.

The sources include images of Leopard tanks <image:2767>, <image:2768>, <image:2769>, and <image:2776>.


### Evidence from `web_search`
The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kursk_campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kursk_campaign)) discusses the 2024 Kursk offensive, which began on August 6, 2024, as part of the Russo-Ukrainian War. The article mentions the involvement of Ukrainian forces entering Russia's Kursk Oblast, leading to clashes, the involvement of Ukrainian brigades, the capture of territory, and casualties on both sides. The BBC article ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0q198zyppqo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0q198zyppqo)) discusses the retreat of Ukrainian troops from the Kursk region and mentions destroyed military equipment. The article includes a map showing the Ukrainian advance in August 2024 and the Russian control in March 2025. <image:26>

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Ukrainian forces entered Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024, leading to clashes and the destruction of military equipment. The BBC article mentions destroyed military equipment, which aligns with the image. However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that the image depicts destroyed Ukrainian tanks. Further visual verification is needed to confirm the type of tanks in the image.

Insufficient information is available to verify the claim.

British Army 'funny' bridge tanks in World War II.

Imperial War Museum photo

What’s old is new again as Russia’s wider war on Ukraine grinds toward its fourth year. Sinking into the muddy riverbeds, the vehicles’ improvised surfaces function as bridges.

Kriegsforscher, a Ukrainian drone operator who has been supporting the 20,000 Ukrainian troops who carved a 250-square-mile salient out of Kursk back in August, [spotted](https://x.com/OSINTua/status/1879934656864526653 "https://x.com/OSINTua/status/1879934656864526653")
 one of the BTR-D bridge funnies. Open-source analysts who scour social media for evidence of damaged and destroyed armored vehicles [have identified](https://x.com/moklasen/status/1879939787265646825 "https://x.com/moklasen/status/1879939787265646825")
 at least one more.

A Russian BTR-D bridging vehicle.

Via Kriegsforscher

The funnies seem to be most active on the western edge of the Kursk salient, where Russian paratroopers have been counterattacking since November. The Ukrainians relentlessly bombard civilian bridges and any conventional or pontoon spans Russian engineers build in Kursk—and also target the Russians’ [purpose-built bridging vehicles](https://x.com/OSINTua/status/1879940575618826420 "https://x.com/OSINTua/status/1879940575618826420")
, which are big and unwieldy.

Hence the pivot to the BTR-D funnies."

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:26> This image shows destroyed Ukrainian tanks during Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:26>)
web_search("Ukraine Russia Kursk Oblast August 2024 tanks destroyed")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The reverse image search found the image in multiple sources. One source, from Sputnik Africa, published on October 17, 2024, reports that Ukraine has lost around 40 Leopard tanks since February 2022. The Moscow Times published an article on June 13, 2023, stating that Russia had captured German Leopard tanks in the Zaporizhzhia region. Defence Security Asia, published on May 19, 2024, discusses the destruction of Leopard tanks in Ukraine. None of the sources mention Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024.

The sources include images of Leopard tanks <image:2767>, <image:2768>, <image:2769>, and <image:2776>.


### Evidence from `web_search`
The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kursk_campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kursk_campaign)) discusses the 2024 Kursk offensive, which began on August 6, 2024, as part of the Russo-Ukrainian War. The article mentions the involvement of Ukrainian forces entering Russia's Kursk Oblast, leading to clashes, the involvement of Ukrainian brigades, the capture of territory, and casualties on both sides. The BBC article ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0q198zyppqo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0q198zyppqo)) discusses the retreat of Ukrainian troops from the Kursk region and mentions destroyed military equipment. The article includes a map showing the Ukrainian advance in August 2024 and the Russian control in March 2025. <image:26>

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Ukrainian forces entered Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024, leading to clashes and the destruction of military equipment. The BBC article mentions destroyed military equipment, which aligns with the image. However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that the image depicts destroyed Ukrainian tanks. Further visual verification is needed to confirm the type of tanks in the image.

Insufficient information is available to verify the claim.
