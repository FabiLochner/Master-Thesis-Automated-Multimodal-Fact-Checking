Useful result: From [Source](https://understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-august-24-2025): 
Content: The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) published an assessment on August 24, 2025, discussing the ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia. <image:9608> The assessment, authored by Grace Mappes, Christina Harward, Olivia Gibson, Jessica Sobieski, and Karolina Hird with Nate Trotter, analyzes the Russian offensive campaign. The report highlights that Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov rejected US-proposed initiatives for peace in Ukraine and continued to mischaracterize Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as an impediment to peace. The report also mentions a prisoner exchange between Ukraine and Russia on August 24, 2025.

The claim 'In early 2025, Ukraine and Russia had reached a peace deal in their years-long war.' is false.
Justification: The evidence indicates that while peace negotiations were underway in early 2025, no peace deal was reached. The Institute for the Study of War reported in August 2025 that Russia rejected US-proposed peace initiatives, indicating the war was still ongoing.

So, the overall veracity is: false
