The claim 'In March 2025 former President of Poland Lech Wałęsa wrote a letter to Donald Trump criticizing the U.S. President's decision to suspend the delivery of all U.S. military aid to Ukraine.' is false.
Justification: In March 2025, Lech Wałęsa wrote a letter to Donald Trump criticizing his treatment of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as reported by [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/polish-cold-war-hero-walesa-writes-trump-expressing-horror-zelenskiy-spat-2025-03-03/), [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/05/nx-s1-5317474/nobel-peace-prize-winner-lech-walesa-condemns-president-trumps-treatment-of-zelenskyy), and the [Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-03-03/polish-democracy-hero-walesa-says-trump-treatment-of-zelensky-filled-him-with-horror). However, the available sources do not mention the suspension of U.S. military aid to Ukraine, making it impossible to verify that part of the claim.
