Useful result: From [Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0q198zyppqo):

The Ukrainian military chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said Ukrainian troops have advanced 35 kilometers through Russian defenses since the start of their surprise assault, capturing 1,150 square kilometers of territory and 82 settlements.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250315-zelensky-denies-troops-surrounded-in-kursk-as-russia-retakes-villages): 
Content: France 24 published an article on March 15, 2025, discussing the situation in the Kursk region. The article mentions that Zelensky denied that Ukrainian troops were encircled in the Kursk region, where Russia has retaken villages. The article also mentions that Moscow has released images of a destroyed center in Sudzha, which was occupied by Ukrainian forces. <image:i>.

The claim '<image:7> This image shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky arriving in August 2024 in the Sudzha of Kursk region, Russia, which had just been occupied by Ukrainian troops in the Kursk Offensive, and meeting with representatives of the people there.' is false.
Justification: The image in the claim is from May 2022 and shows Zelensky in the Kharkiv region, not the Kursk region in August 2024. While Ukrainian forces did capture Sudzha in the Kursk region in August 2024, as reported by CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/15/europe/kursk-incursion-sudzha-captured-ukraine-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/15/europe/kursk-incursion-sudzha-captured-ukraine-intl)), the image is unrelated to this event.

So, the overall veracity is: false
