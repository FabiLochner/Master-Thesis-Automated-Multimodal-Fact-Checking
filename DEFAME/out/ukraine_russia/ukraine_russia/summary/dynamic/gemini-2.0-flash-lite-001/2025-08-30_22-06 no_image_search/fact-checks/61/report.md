The Economic Times reported that one of Putin's official limousines exploded in central Moscow, raising security concerns (![image 9727](media/2025-08-30_22-27-1756592836-745206.jpg), ![image 9728](media/2025-08-30_22-27-1756592837-285223.jpg)). The Sun reported that the explosion happened days after Zelensky's statement and amid rumors about Putin's health.

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that one of Vladimir Putin's limousines was involved in an incident. Newsweek reports a fire, while The Economic Times and UAWire report an explosion. However, none of the reports confirm the death of Vladimir Putin. The reports mention security concerns and rumors about Putin's health, but they do not provide any information to support the claim that Putin died in an explosion.

The evidence indicates that an incident occurred involving one of Putin's limousines, but it does not confirm the claim that Putin died in an explosion.

To verify the claim, information is missing about Putin's presence in the vehicle during the incident and whether he was harmed.


## Final Judgement
The search results indicate that one of Putin's limousines was involved in an incident, with reports of a fire and an explosion. However, none of the reports confirm the death of Vladimir Putin.

The claim is not supported by the evidence. The reports do not confirm Putin's death. Therefore, the most appropriate decision option is `false`.


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
Reports from various news sources, including Newsweek and The Economic Times, indicate that an incident occurred involving one of Vladimir Putin's limousines, with mentions of a fire and an explosion. However, none of the provided evidence confirms the death of Vladimir Putin, thus the claim is unsubstantiated.
