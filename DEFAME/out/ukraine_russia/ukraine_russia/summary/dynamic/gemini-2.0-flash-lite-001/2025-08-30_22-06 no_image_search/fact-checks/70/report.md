## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Fact Crescendo states that there has been no official declaration of war by Russia against the USA, and the claim is unfounded. The BBC article discusses the war in Ukraine and Putin's goals, including "demilitarise and denazify" Ukraine, and mentions Putin's false allegations and refusal to agree to peace talks. The Journal of Democracy article discusses Putin's hostile policies toward the United States and his justification for them, including the NATO threat.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the claim is unfounded. Fact Crescendo explicitly states that there has been no official declaration of war by Russia against the USA. The other sources discuss Putin's actions and policies, including his hostility towards the United States, but do not mention a declaration of war.


## Final Judgement
The evidence from multiple sources confirms that there has been no declaration of war by Russia against the United States. The sources provided discuss Putin's actions and policies, but none mention a declaration of war.
