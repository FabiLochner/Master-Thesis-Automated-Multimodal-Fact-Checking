Keyword searches found a similar claim has circulated since 2023, which has been [debunked](https://mythdetector.ge/en/ukrainian-lands-and-banned-the-burial-of-military-personnel/)
 by other fact-checking organizations, including Myth Detector based in Georgia.

Dafina Kandova, a journalist with the Bulgarian checking organization factcheck.bg, told AFCL that her organization had [checked](https://factcheck.bg/ne-e-vyarno-che-amerikanskata-kompaniya-blackrock-zabranyava-na-ukrajna-da-pogrebva-ubitite-si-vojnici-si-v-grobishta/)

 similar rumors circulating in Bulgaria at the end of 2023.

Dafina added that while Plamen Paskov often appears as a commentator for the Bulgarian nationalist Ataka party, he is not actually an official member of the party and has not been elected to public office.

Paskov’s popularity is largely built on social media, gaining followers by spreading conspiracy theories related to hot topics such as COVID-19 and the war in Ukraine, she added. 6, 2024.

“BlackRock purchased 47% of Ukraine’s arable lands … BlackRock has asked the Ukrainian government to stop burying deceased Ukrainian soldiers and look for other ways to take care of them because it wants to use the lands in a different way,” reads the claim in part.

Zhao cited a Bulgarian politician named Plamen Paskov whose claim about BlackRock's land ownership in Ukraine was previously [shared](https://big5.sputniknews.cn/20240802/1060759436.html)
 by Russia's state-run Sputnik news agency.

The same claim was shared on other Chinese websites as seen [here](https://user.guancha.cn/main/content?id=1280544)

‘In an article published in early August, Russian and Chinese media quoted a purported Bulgarian politician as saying that U.S. The New York-based multinational asset manager has a big enough stake in many influential companies worldwide to push them to change decisions and priorities.

According to a Ukrainian government [press release](https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/prezident-obgovoriv-z-generalnim-direktorom-blackrock-koordi-80105)
, President Volodymyr Zelensky met BlackRock CEO Larry Fink to discuss how Ukraine could raise national reconstruction funds at the end of 2022.

In May 2023, the Ukrainian government [signed](https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/prezident-proviv-zustrich-iz-kerivnictvom-najbilshoyi-u-svit-82725)
 an agreement with BlackRock to provide support services to the Ukraine Development Fund in order to attract funds to rebuild the economy after the war ends.

But the claim about BlackRock’s land ownership in Ukraine and its request to the government regarding deceased soldiers is false.

Under Ukrainian law, foreign companies and individuals are [prohibited](https://www.fao.org/faolex/results/details/en/c/LEX-FAOC043459/)
 from purchasing arable land.

“Agricultural land cannot be transferred (allotted) to foreigners, stateless persons, foreign legal entities and foreign states,” reads the Article 22 of Ukraine’s Land Code (No. BlackRock does not own any land in Ukraine.”

On June 23-24, Russian-language Facebook accounts ([1](https://www.facebook.com/olga.petkevich.1/posts/pfbid0zFb8scpYzp1pemiXc82TUkYLAcd6MCyL35uNww8jr6aRcY5vT25dNUPtRSsfLR1Dl)

) reported that 17 million hectares of Ukrainian agricultural land were already transferred to international corporations within the framework of the “Ukraine Development Fund” created in 2023. The posts state that the creator of this fund, Larry Fink, who is the head of the American corporation BlackRock, banned the burial of dead Ukrainian soldiers on this land, because “unsustainable waste of valuable arable land” is inappropriate.

Identical posts were published by Russian-language users ([1](https://www.facebook.com/100050002686731/videos/2243608662643791)
,[2](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid02436rJyqZ29mLzwfwB6749KG1EHHknwMEJT6WMSA7RBLxSBq7fShqoN7viQzb4YWUl&id=100006870016043)
) on May 12. Ukrainian legislation prohibits foreign companies from purchasing agricultural land.**

Russian director, actor, and propagandist Nikita Mikhalkov also voiced the claim that Larry Fink, the co-founder and CEO of the American company BlackRock, forbade the burial of Ukrainian soldiers killed in the Russian-Ukrainian war on Ukrainian soil. The claim that Ukraine was sold to the mentioned company is a Russian propaganda narrative, which is also [voiced](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/kyiv-has-sold-ukraine-to-blackrock-russia-lambasts-ukraine-for-taking-support-from-us/videoshow/106731755.cms?from=mdr)
 by Russian high-ranking officials.

It is also false to claim that international corporations have bought 17 million hectares of Ukrainian land. For more details, see:

### War and Theft: The Takeover of Ukraine’s Agricultural Land exposes the financial interests and the dynamics at play leading to further concentration of land and finance.

The total amount of land controlled by oligarchs, corrupt individuals, and large agribusinesses is over nine million hectares — exceeding 28 percent of Ukraine’s arable land. <image:2886>](https://www.oaklandinstitute.org/war-theft-takeover-ukraine-agricultural-land)
Western financing to Ukraine in recent years has been tied to a drastic structural adjustment program that has required austerity and privatization measures, including the creation of a land market for the sale of agricultural land. With the land market in place, amidst high economic stress and war, this difference of treatment will lead to more land consolidation by large agribusinesses.

The report also sounds the alarm that Ukraine’s crippling debt is being used as a leverage by the financial institutions to drive post-war reconstruction towards further privatization and liberalization reforms in several sectors, including agriculture.

This report addresses this gap – identifying the interests controlling Ukraine’s agricultural land and presenting an analysis of the dynamics at play around land tenure in the country. This includes the highly controversial land reform that took place in 2021 as part of the structural adjustment program initiated under the auspices of Western financial institutions, after the installation of a pro-European Union (EU) government following the Maidan Revolution in 2014.

With 33 million hectares of arable land, Ukraine has large swaths of the most fertile farmland in the world. <image:2888>](https://www.oaklandinstitute.org/war-theft-takeover-ukraine-agricultural-land)
In addition, according to the government, about five million hectares – the size of two Crimea – have been “stolen” by private interests from the state of Ukraine."

CNN  — 

Putting prisoners of war in front of reporters and news cameras is almost certainly a violation of international humanitarian law.

But Ukraine clearly felt any reputational damage it might suffer by doing so in a news conference this week would be outweighed by the fact that it featured two alleged captured fighters from China.

There was more value in giving them a platform to speak, the argument presumably ran, than protecting them “against insult and public curiosity” – something the International Committee of the Red Cross says includes protection from the media.

China has always claimed neutrality in [Russia’s war on Ukraine](https://www.cnn.com/world/europe/ukraine)
 and repeatedly tells its citizens not to get involved in foreign conflicts. They had been fighting for only three days.

The role of foreign fighters
----------------------------

Foreign fighters have been a part of this war – on both sides – since the beginning.

A list seen by CNN showing non-Russian POWs held by Ukraine as of the end of 2024 showed six Sri Lankan nationals, seven from Nepal, plus individuals from Somalia, Republic of Congo, Sierra Leone, Egypt and Syria, as well as about a dozen from former Soviet republics.

In January, Ukraine also captured two North Koreans, part of an estimated force of about 14,000 troops sent by Pyongyang to help Moscow’s war effort.

A source at Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence told CNN that Russia needed its foreign fighters because it was now locked into a war of attrition.

“It is unable to maintain the long front line with its own soldiers alone and is taking every opportunity to recruit whoever it can,” the source said.

Since the announcement of the Chinese men’s capture last week – which was followed by Ukraine declaring it had information on a further 155 Chinese citizens fighting for Russia – considerable interest has focused on how they were recruited and whether China’s government had played an active role in some way.

Certainly, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky did nothing to tamp down such speculation when asked by reporters whether he thought the presence of Chinese nationals in Ukraine was the result of official Beijing policy.

“I don’t have an answer to this question yet. [](#maincontent)

CNN has seen a Russian military contract signed by a separate Chinese fighter which gives a possible indication of what the two POWs had agreed to.

The contract, which was shown to CNN by a Ukrainian intelligence source, is written in Russian. The Security Service of Ukraine will work on it,” he said last week, adding, “We are not saying that someone gave any command, we do not have such information.”

But Zelensky went on to say that Kyiv believed that Beijing was aware of what was happening.

![A man rides his bicycle past the building of the Chinese embassy in Kyiv on April 8, 2025.](https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2208587347.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill)

The POWs were at pains to indicate otherwise, both saying that they were acting as individuals, pointing to slick recruitment videos posted to TikTok as the source of their inspiration.

One such clip has been circulating on Chinese social media networks for more than a year and appears to have originally been created for a domestic Russian audience, with Chinese subtitles added later.

It shows what appear to be Russian soldiers training and dressed in combat fatigues in the field. “You’re a man, be a man,” it says in Russian, alongside Chinese subtitles, which also explain the payments on offer for signing up.

It is impossible to say if the subtitles were added by an official entity or by social media users, but one of the men said the videos resonated in China, where military prowess is highly prized, but opportunities for direct combat experience are rare.

Why the timing matters
----------------------

Though Ukraine has hosted news conferences with POWs previously, including one involving combatants from Nepal and several African countries, its decision to platform its Chinese POWs is still unusual.

The timing is important.

It comes amid Kyiv’s attempts to get the upper hand in its battle with Moscow for the ear of US President [Donald Trump](https://www.cnn.com/politics/president-donald-trump-47)
, whose administration appears to be making little headway in its efforts to convince the Kremlin to agree to a full ceasefire.

Washington has also been heavily focused on China, which some in the White House see as the United States’ main global adversary, and which the administration has been hitting with progressively larger import tariffs.

From Zelensky’s perspective, there is a clear interest in amplifying anything that suggests China’s support for Russia might be more than diplomatic and economic.

But it might not just be the US that Ukraine’s leader is sending a message to.

Anders Puck Nielsen of the Royal Danish Defence College believes Kyiv is also anxious about recent European Union overtures to China, as the two economic powerhouses look for possible joint solutions in the face of Trump’s trade wars.

“Suddenly it seems there might be potential for the Europeans and the Chinese to find common ground on other questions as well,” Nielsen told CNN.

“It has clearly been a political move to really emphasize this aspect (of Chinese fighters in the Russian army),” he added.

Beijing certainly saw it like that.

“We urge the relevant parties concerned to correctly and soberly understand the role of China and to not release irresponsible remarks,” foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian said, without mentioning names.

“When we reached a forest, my captain told me, ‘Da, da, da’ (“Yes, yes, yes” in Russian), signaling me to start the attack. Then I saw the captain of (another Russian unit) throw in a grenade, and suddenly there were (Ukrainian) drones everywhere.”

The men surrendered. The prospect of 250,000 rubles (around $3,000) per month in Russia was more than double what he could expect to earn at home.

As someone with experience in medical rehabilitation, he said he told the recruiter he wanted to do the same with the Russian military. But when he got to Moscow, he was forced into training for a combat role.

Documents were only in Russian, which neither man said they understood."

Moscow stages largest Victory Day parade since start of Ukraine war with Putin using celebrations to justify invasion

Russian troops fighting in [Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine)
 have marched with Chinese forces on Moscow’s Red Square to mark the 80th anniversary of Nazi Germany’s defeat in a Victory Day celebration marked by greater spectacle than in recent years.

After several scaled-back Victory Days – with reduced military displays and few foreign guests – [Vladimir Putin](https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin)
 on Friday addressed the largest parade since his 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

“The Soviet Union took upon itself the most ferocious, merciless blows of the enemy,” the Russian president said of the victory over Nazi Germany, before turning to his invasion of Ukraine. “For now, he is stalling for time,” he said.

Chinese troops march through Moscow’s Red Square during the Victory Day parade in on Friday. The entire country, society and people support the participants of the special military operation,” Putin said, using the Kremlin’s preferred term to describe the war.

While Putin was presiding over the parade, EU foreign ministers and Britain’s David Lammy travelled to Lviv in Ukraine where they announced the establishment of a tribunal for Russian war crimes. The Kremlin presented the turnout as proof that it is not isolated, even four years into its war in Ukraine.

Other guests included leaders from fellow autocracies and pariah regimes, such as the military juntas from Myanmar and Burkina Faso.

Putin also thanked a visiting North Korean military delegation – a sign of deepening ties and new geopolitical realities after recent [admissions from both sides](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/28/north-korea-troops-fighting-for-russia-ukraine-confirmed-kim-jong-un)
 that North Korean troops have been fighting alongside Russian forces in Ukraine.

Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin at the Victory Day parade in Moscow. “We have the chance at this historic moment to make our commercial relationship grow a lot,” he said.

This year’s parade featured an expanded military presence, with a fleet of tanks rolling across Red Square alongside rocket launchers, TOS-2 Tosochka heavy flamethrower systems and Iskander ballistic missiles – all weapons used in the war in Ukraine. But since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion, the Kremlin’s mass propaganda machine has given it new meaning, with Putin using the celebrations to justify the current war.

Seated not far from Putin were several high-profile veterans of the war in Ukraine, while Russian media reported that more than 1,500 troops who took part in the invasion participated in the march.

Putin has weaponised the legacy of the second world war to mobilise support for his invasion, falsely portraying Zelenskyy, who is Jewish, as a leader resurrecting nazism in Ukraine.

Andrei Kolesnikov, a Moscow-based political analyst, said: “Victory Day is by far the most important celebration for Putin – it’s an ideological event designed to rally the nation around him. Zelenskyy dismissed the offer as self-serving and meaningless unless it was extended to 30 days, in line with a US-backed proposal that Putin has so far rejected.

In the lead-up to Victory Day, Ukraine significantly increased its drone attacks on Moscow and surrounding regions, causing airport closures and logistical chaos.

Russian troops who were involved in the war in Ukraine march in columns during a Victory Day parade. As many observers had predicted, Kyiv appeared to refrain from targeting Moscow on the day of the parade, probably owing to the presence of high-profile international dignitaries.

Still, fighting continued near the frontlines, with Moscow accusing Ukrainian forces of attempting to breach the border in Russia’s Kursk and Belgorod regions.

This year’s parade comes at what many see as a crossroads moment for Moscow, as the Trump administration steps up its efforts to persuade Putin to end the war."

An **airliner** is a type of [airplane](/wiki/Airplane "Airplane")
 for transporting [passengers](/wiki/Passenger "Passenger")
 and [air cargo](/wiki/Air_cargo "Air cargo")
. Such aircraft are most often operated by [airlines](/wiki/Airline "Airline")
. The modern and most common variant of the airliner is a long, tube shaped, and [jet powered aircraft](/wiki/Jetliner "Jetliner")
. The largest of them are [wide-body](/wiki/Wide-body_aircraft "Wide-body aircraft")
 jets which are also called twin-aisle because they generally have two separate aisles running from the front to the back of the passenger cabin. These are usually used for [long-haul flights](/wiki/Flight_length#Short-haul_and_long-haul "Flight length")
 between [airline hubs](/wiki/Airline_hub "Airline hub")
 and major cities. A smaller, more common class of airliners is the [narrow-body](/wiki/Narrow-body_aircraft "Narrow-body aircraft")
 or single-aisle. These are generally used for short to medium-distance flights with fewer passengers than their wide-body counterparts.

[Regional airliners](/wiki/Regional_airliner "Regional airliner")
 typically seat fewer than 100 passengers and may be powered by [turbofans](/wiki/Turbofan "Turbofan")
 or [turboprops](/wiki/Turboprop "Turboprop")
. These airliners are the non-[mainline](/wiki/Mainline_(flight) "Mainline (flight)")
 counterparts to the larger aircraft operated by the major carriers, [legacy carriers](/wiki/Legacy_carrier "Legacy carrier")
, and [flag carriers](/wiki/Flag_carrier "Flag carrier")
, and are used to feed traffic into the large airline hubs. These regional routes then form the spokes of a hub-and-spoke air transport model.

The lightest aircraft are short-haul regional feeder airliner type aircraft that carry a small number of passengers are called commuter aircraft, commuterliners, feederliners, and [air taxis](/wiki/Air_taxi "Air taxi")
, depending on their size, engines, how they are marketed, region of the world, and seating configurations. The [Beechcraft 1900](/wiki/Beechcraft_1900 "Beechcraft 1900")
, for example, has only 19 seats.

When the [Wright brothers](/wiki/Wright_brothers "Wright brothers")
 made the world's first sustained [heavier-than-air flight](/wiki/Heavier-than-air_flight "Heavier-than-air flight")
, they laid the foundation for what would become a major transport industry. Their flight, performed in the [Wright Flyer](/wiki/Wright_Flyer "Wright Flyer")
 during 1903,[\[1\]](#cite_note-NewarkDailyAdvocate_19031228-1)
 was just 11 years before what is often defined as the world's first airliner.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Tise-2)
 By the 1960s, airliners had expanded capabilities, making a significant impact on global society, economics, and politics.[\[3\]](#cite_note-Bernardo-3)

[Sikorsky Ilya Muromets](/wiki/Sikorsky_Ilya_Muromets "Sikorsky Ilya Muromets")

During 1913, [Igor Sikorsky](/wiki/Igor_Sikorsky "Igor Sikorsky")
 developed the first large multi-engine airplane, the [Russky Vityaz](/wiki/Sikorsky_Russky_Vityaz "Sikorsky Russky Vityaz")
.[\[4\]](#cite_note-4)
[\[5\]](#cite_note-5)
 This aircraft was subsequently refined into the more practical [Ilya Muromets](/wiki/Sikorsky_Ilya_Muromets "Sikorsky Ilya Muromets")
, being furnished with dual controls for a pilot and copilot and a comfortable [cabin](/wiki/Aircraft_cabin "Aircraft cabin")
 with a lavatory, cabin heating and lighting.[\[6\]](#cite_note-ASM0807-6)
 This large four-engine biplane was further adapted into an early [bomber aircraft](/wiki/Bomber_aircraft "Bomber aircraft")
, preceding subsequent transport and bomber aircraft.[\[6\]](#cite_note-ASM0807-6)
 It first flew on 10 December 1913 and took off for its first demonstration flight with 16 passengers aboard on 25 February 1914. However, it was never used as a commercial airliner due to the onset of the [First World War](/wiki/First_World_War "First World War")
 which led to military applications being prioritised.[\[7\]](#cite_note-7)

### Interwar period

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Interwar period")\
\]

In 1919, shortly after the end of the First World War, large numbers of ex-military aircraft flooded the market. One such aircraft was the French [Farman F.60 Goliath](/wiki/Farman_F.60_Goliath "Farman F.60 Goliath")
, which had originally been designed as a long-range [heavy bomber](/wiki/Heavy_bomber "Heavy bomber")
; a number were converted for commercial use into passenger airliners starting in 1919, being able to accommodate a maximum of 14 seated passengers. and around 60 were built. Initially, several publicity flights were made, including one on 8 February 1919, when the Goliath flew 12 passengers from [Toussus-le-Noble](/wiki/Toussus-le-Noble "Toussus-le-Noble")
 to [RAF Kenley](/wiki/RAF_Kenley "RAF Kenley")
, near [Croydon](/wiki/Croydon "Croydon")
, despite having no permission from the British authorities to land. Dozens of early airlines subsequently procured the type.[\[9\]](#cite_note-aeroplane1015-9)
 One high-profile flight, made on 11 August 1919, involved an F.60 flying eight passengers and a ton of supplies from Paris via [Casablanca](/wiki/Casablanca "Casablanca")
 and [Mogador](/wiki/Mogador "Mogador")
 to Koufa, 180 km (110 mi) north of [Saint-Louis, Senegal](/wiki/Saint-Louis,_Senegal "Saint-Louis, Senegal")
, flying more than 4,500 km (2,800 mi).[\[10\]](#cite_note-10)

Another important airliner built in 1919 was the [Airco DH.16](/wiki/Airco_DH.16 "Airco DH.16")
; a redesigned [Airco DH.9A](/wiki/Airco_DH.9A "Airco DH.9A")
 with a wider [fuselage](/wiki/Fuselage "Fuselage")
 to accommodate an enclosed cabin seating four passengers, plus pilot in an open cockpit. In March 1919, the prototype first flew at [Hendon Aerodrome](/wiki/Hendon_Aerodrome "Hendon Aerodrome")
. Nine aircraft were built, all but one being delivered to the nascent airline, [Aircraft Transport and Travel](/wiki/Aircraft_Transport_and_Travel "Aircraft Transport and Travel")
, which used the first aircraft for pleasure flying, and on 25 August 1919, it inaugurated the first scheduled international airline service from London to Paris.[\[11\]](#cite_note-Jackson_Civil_V2_p62-11)
 One aircraft was sold to the River Plate Aviation Company in [Argentina](/wiki/Argentina "Argentina")
, to operate a cross-river service between [Buenos Aires](/wiki/Buenos_Aires "Buenos Aires")
 and [Montevideo](/wiki/Montevideo "Montevideo")
.[\[11\]](#cite_note-Jackson_Civil_V2_p62-11)
 Meanwhile, the competing [Vickers](/wiki/Vickers "Vickers")
 converted its successful First World War era bomber, the [Vickers Vimy](/wiki/Vickers_Vimy "Vickers Vimy")
, into a civilian version, the Vimy Commercial. It was redesigned with a larger-diameter fuselage (largely of [spruce](/wiki/Spruce "Spruce")
 plywood), and first flew from the Joyce Green airfield in [Kent](/wiki/Kent "Kent")
 on 13 April 1919.[\[12\]](#cite_note-Andrews_Vickersp95-12)
[\[13\]](#cite_note-Jackson_v3_p202-13)

The world's first all-metal transport aircraft was the [Junkers F.13](/wiki/Junkers_F.13 "Junkers F.13")
, which also made its first flight in 1919.[\[14\]](#cite_note-14)
 Junkers marketed the aircraft towards business travellers and commercial operators, and European entrepreneurs bought examples for their private use and business trips. Over 300 Junkers F 13s were built between 1919 and 1932.[\[15\]](#cite_note-15)
 The Dutch [Fokker](/wiki/Fokker "Fokker")
 company produced the [Fokker F.II](/wiki/Fokker_F.II "Fokker F.II")
, then the enlarged [F.III](/wiki/Fokker_F.III "Fokker F.III")
.[\[16\]](#cite_note-Flight260521p355-16)
 These were used by the Dutch airline [KLM](/wiki/KLM "KLM")
, including on its Amsterdam-London service in 1921. A relatively reliable aircraft for the era, the Fokkers were flying to destinations across Europe, including Bremen, Brussels, Hamburg, and Paris.[\[17\]](#cite_note-deLeeuw-17)

The [Handley Page](/wiki/Handley_Page "Handley Page")
 company in Britain produced the [Handley Page Type W](/wiki/Handley_Page_Type_W "Handley Page Type W")
, its first civil transport aircraft. It housed two crew in an open [cockpit](/wiki/Cockpit "Cockpit")
 and 15 passengers in an enclosed cabin. Powered by two 450 hp (340 kW) [Napier Lion](/wiki/Napier_Lion "Napier Lion")
 engines, the prototype first flew on 4 December 1919, shortly after it was displayed at the 1919 [Paris Air Show](/wiki/Paris_Air_Show "Paris Air Show")
 at [Le Bourget](/wiki/Le_Bourget "Le Bourget")
. It was ordered by the Belgian firm [Sabena](/wiki/Sabena "Sabena")

In France, the [Bleriot-SPAD S.33](/wiki/Bleriot-SPAD_S.33 "Bleriot-SPAD S.33")
 was introduced during the early 1920s.[\[20\]](#cite_note-Flight070721p460-20)
 It was commercially successful, initially serving the Paris-[London](/wiki/London "London")
 route, and later on [continental](/wiki/Europe "Europe")
 routes. The enclosed cabin could carry four passengers with an extra seat in the cockpit. It was further developed into the [Blériot-SPAD S.46](/wiki/Bl%C3%A9riot-SPAD_S.46 "Blériot-SPAD S.46")
. Throughout the 1920s, companies in Britain and France were at the forefront of the civil airliner industry.[\[21\]](#cite_note-21)

By 1921, the capacity of airliners needed to be increased to achieve more favourable economics. The English company [de Havilland](/wiki/De_Havilland "De Havilland")
, built the 10-passenger [DH.29](/wiki/De_Havilland_Doncaster "De Havilland Doncaster")
 monoplane,[\[22\]](#cite_note-Jackson_Civil_V2_pageneeded-22)

The [Ford Trimotor](/wiki/Ford_Trimotor "Ford Trimotor")
 had two engines mounted on the wings and one in the nose, and a slabsided body, it carried eight passengers and was produced from 1925 to 1933.[\[25\]](#cite_note-Herrick_2004-25)
 It was an important early airliner in America. It was used by the predecessor to [Trans World Airlines](/wiki/Trans_World_Airlines "Trans World Airlines")
, and by other airlines long after production ceased. The Trimotor helped to popularise numerous aspects of modern aviation infrastructure, including paved [runways](/wiki/Runway "Runway")

[\[28\]](#cite_note-Daley,_Robert_1980,_page_103-28)

By the 1930s, the airliner industry had matured and large consolidated national airlines were established with regular international services that spanned the globe, including [Imperial Airways](/wiki/Imperial_Airways "Imperial Airways")
 in Britain, [Lufthansa](/wiki/Lufthansa "Lufthansa")
 in Germany, KLM in the Netherlands, and [United Airlines](/wiki/United_Airlines "United Airlines")
 in America. Multi-engined aircraft were now capable of transporting dozens of passengers in comfort.[\[29\]](#cite_note-29)

During the 1930s, the British [de Havilland Dragon](/wiki/De_Havilland_Dragon "De Havilland Dragon")
 emerged as a short-haul, low-capacity airliner. Its relatively simple design could carry six passengers, each with 45 lb (20 kg) of luggage, on the London-Paris route on a fuel consumption of 13 gal (49 L) per hour.[\[30\]](#cite_note-30)
 The DH.84 Dragon entered worldwide service. During early August 1934, one performed the first non-stop flight between the Canadian mainland and Britain in 30 hours 55 minutes, although the intended destination had originally been [Baghdad](/wiki/Baghdad "Baghdad")
 in [Iraq](/wiki/Iraq "Iraq")
.[\[31\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTERiding1980289-31)

, a faster and more comfortable successor.[\[33\]](#cite_note-moss_3-33)

By November 1934, series production of the Dragon Rapide had commenced.[\[34\]](#cite_note-moss_4-34)
 De Havilland invested into advanced features including elongated rear windows, cabin heating, thickened wing tips, and a strengthened airframe for a higher gross weight of 5,500 lb (2,500 kg).[\[35\]](#cite_note-moss_5-35)
 Later aircraft were amongst the first airliners to be fitted with [flaps](/wiki/Flap_(aeronautics) "Flap (aeronautics)")
 for improved landing performance, along with downwards-facing recognition light and metal propellers, which were often retrofitted to older aircraft.[\[36\]](#cite_note-moss_6-36)

 flew during the first half of the decade, while the more powerful, faster, 21–32 passenger [Douglas DC-3](/wiki/Douglas_DC-3 "Douglas DC-3")
 first appeared in 1935. DC-3s were produced in quantity for the [Second World War](/wiki/Second_World_War "Second World War")
 and were sold as surplus afterward, becoming widespread within the commercial sector. It was one of first airliners to be profitable without the support of postal or government subsidies.[\[40\]](#cite_note-Mellberg-40)
[\[41\]](#cite_note-41)

Long-haul flights were expanded during the 1930s as Pan American Airways and Imperial Airways competed on [transatlantic travel](/wiki/Transatlantic_flight "Transatlantic flight")
 using fleets of [flying boats](/wiki/Flying_boat "Flying boat")
, such as the British [Short Empire](/wiki/Short_Empire "Short Empire")
 and the American [Boeing 314](/wiki/Boeing_314 "Boeing 314")
.[\[42\]](#cite_note-bogash-42)
 Imperial Airways' order for 28 Empire flying boats was viewed by some as a bold gamble.[\[43\]](#cite_note-norris_3-43)
 At the time, flying boats were the only practical means of building aircraft of such size and weight as land-based aircraft would have unfeasibly poor field performance.[\[43\]](#cite_note-norris_3-43)
 One Boeing 314, [registration NC18602](/wiki/Extended_flight_of_Pan_American_NC18602 "Extended flight of Pan American NC18602")

 British aircraft manufacturers were tied up to fulfill military requirements, and had no free capacity to address other matters though the war.[\[48\]](#cite_note-48)

The committee final report pushed four designs for the state-owned airlines [British Overseas Airways Corporation](/wiki/British_Overseas_Airways_Corporation "British Overseas Airways Corporation")
 (BOAC) and later [British European Airways](/wiki/British_European_Airways "British European Airways")
 (BEA): three piston-powered aircraft of varying sizes, and a [jet-powered](/wiki/Jet_engine "Jet engine")
 100-seat design at the request of [Geoffrey de Havilland](/wiki/Geoffrey_de_Havilland "Geoffrey de Havilland")
, involved in the first jet fighters development.

After a brief contest, the Type I design was given to the [Bristol Aeroplane Company](/wiki/Bristol_Aeroplane_Company "Bristol Aeroplane Company")
, building on a "100 ton [bomber](/wiki/Bomber "Bomber")
" submission.[\[49\]](#cite_note-Barnes324-49)
 This evolved into the [Bristol Brabazon](/wiki/Bristol_Brabazon "Bristol Brabazon")

 engine.[\[50\]](#cite_note-Phipp67-50)

The Type II was split between the [de Havilland Dove](/wiki/De_Havilland_Dove "De Havilland Dove")

, although both aircraft suffered protracted developments,[\[54\]](#cite_note-Barnes347-54)
 with the latter entering service with BOAC in February 1957, over seven years following its order.[\[55\]](#cite_note-Phipp105-55)

The jet-powered Type IV became the [de Havilland Comet](/wiki/De_Havilland_Comet "De Havilland Comet")
 in 1949. It featured an aerodynamically clean design with four [de Havilland Ghost](/wiki/De_Havilland_Ghost "De Havilland Ghost")

[\[59\]](#cite_note-59)
 The Comet was grounded and tested to discover the cause, while rival manufacturers heeded the lessons learned while developing their own aircraft.[\[60\]](#cite_note-60)
 The improved Comet 2 and the prototype Comet 3 culminated in the redesigned Comet 4 series which debuted in 1958 and had a productive career over 30 years, but sales never fully recovered.[\[61\]](#cite_note-Phipp93-61)

Soon after the war, most of the Soviet fleet of airliners consisted of DC-3s or [Lisunov Li-2s](/wiki/Lisunov_Li-2 "Lisunov Li-2")
. These planes were in desperate need of replacement, and in 1946, the [Ilyushin Il-12](/wiki/Ilyushin_Il-12 "Ilyushin Il-12")
 made its first flight. The Il-12 was very similar in design to American Convair 240, except was unpressurized. In 1953, the [Ilyushin Il-14](/wiki/Ilyushin_Il-14 "Ilyushin Il-14")
 made its first flight, and this version was equipped with much more powerful engines. The main contribution that the Soviets made in regards to airliners was the [Antonov An-2](/wiki/Antonov_An-2 "Antonov An-2")
. This plane is a biplane, unlike most of the other airliners, and sold more units than any other transport plane.[\[63\]](#cite_note-Jarrett-63)

Engines
-------

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Engines")\
\]

Until the beginning of the [Jet Age](/wiki/Jet_Age "Jet Age")
, [piston engines](/wiki/Piston_engine "Piston engine")
 were common on [propliners](/wiki/Propliner "Propliner")
 such as the Douglas DC-3. Nearly all modern airliners are now powered by [turbine](/wiki/Gas_turbine "Gas turbine")
 engines, either [turbofans](/wiki/Turbofan "Turbofan")
 or [turboprops](/wiki/Turboprop "Turboprop")
. Gas turbine engines operate efficiently at much higher altitudes, are more reliable than piston engines, and produce less vibration and noise. The use of a common fuel type – kerosene-based jet fuel – is another advantage.

Airliner variants
-----------------

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Airliner variants")\
\]

Some variants of airliners have been developed for carrying freight or for luxury [corporate use](/wiki/Business_jet "Business jet")
. Many airliners have also been modified for government use as [VIP](/wiki/Very_Important_Person "Very Important Person")
 transports and for military functions such as airborne tankers (for example, the [Vickers VC10](/wiki/Vickers_VC10 "Vickers VC10")
, [Lockheed L-1011](/wiki/Lockheed_L-1011 "Lockheed L-1011")
, [Boeing 707](/wiki/Boeing_707 "Boeing 707")
), air ambulance ([USAF](/wiki/United_States_Air_Force "United States Air Force")
/[USN](/wiki/United_States_Navy "United States Navy")
 [McDonnell Douglas DC-9](/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_DC-9 "McDonnell Douglas DC-9")
), [reconnaissance](/wiki/Aerial_reconnaissance "Aerial reconnaissance")
 ([Embraer ERJ 145](/wiki/Embraer_ERJ_145_family "Embraer ERJ 145 family")
, [Saab 340](/wiki/Saab_340 "Saab 340")
, and [Boeing 737](/wiki/Boeing_737 "Boeing 737")
), as well as for troop-carrying roles.

Configuration
-------------

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Configuration")\
\]

Modern jetliners are usually low-wing designs with two engines mounted underneath the [swept wings](/wiki/Swept_wing "Swept wing")
, while [turboprop](/wiki/Turboprop "Turboprop")
 aircraft are slow enough to use straight wings. Smaller airliners sometimes have their engines mounted on either side of the rear fuselage. Numerous advantages and disadvantages exist due to this arrangement.[\[74\]](#cite_note-74)
 Perhaps the most important advantage to mounting the engines under the wings is that the total aircraft weight is more evenly distributed across the wingspan, which imposes less [bending moment](/wiki/Bending_moment "Bending moment")
 on the wings and allows for a lighter wing structure. This factor becomes more important as aircraft weight increases, and no in-production airliners have both a maximum takeoff weight more than 50 tons and engines mounted on the fuselage. The [Antonov An-148](/wiki/Antonov_An-148 "Antonov An-148")
 is the only in-production jetliner with high-mounted wings (usually seen in [military transport aircraft](/wiki/Military_transport_aircraft "Military transport aircraft")
), which reduces the risk of damage from unpaved runways.

Except for a few experimental or military designs, all aircraft built to date have had all of their weight [lifted](/wiki/Lift_(force) "Lift (force)")
 off the ground by airflow across the wings. In terms of [aerodynamics](/wiki/Aerodynamics "Aerodynamics")
, the fuselage has been a mere burden. [NASA](/wiki/NASA "NASA")
 and [Boeing](/wiki/Boeing "Boeing")
 are currently developing a [blended wing body](/wiki/Blended_wing_body "Blended wing body")
 design in which the entire airframe, from wingtip to wingtip, contributes lift. This promises a significant gain in [fuel efficiency](/wiki/Fuel_efficiency_in_transportation "Fuel efficiency in transportation")
.[\[75\]](#cite_note-75)

Market
------

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=21 "Edit section: Market")\
\]

Since it began, the [jet airliner](/wiki/Jet_airliner "Jet airliner")
 market had a recurring pattern of seven years of growth followed by three years of deliveries falling 30–40%, except a steady growth from 2004 due to the [economic rise of China](/wiki/Economic_history_of_China_(1949%E2%80%93present)#From_2001 "Economic history of China (1949–present)")
 going from 3% of world market in 2001 to 22% in 2015, expensive [jet fuel](/wiki/Jet_fuel "Jet fuel")

 since 2008, and strong [airline](/wiki/Airline "Airline")
 passenger demand since.[\[84\]](#cite_note-84)
 In 2004, 718 Airbus and Boeings were delivered, worth $39.3 billion; 1,466 are expected in 2017, worth $104.4 billion: a growth by 3.5 from 2004 to 2020 is unprecedented and highly unusual for any mature market.[\[85\]](#cite_note-85)

| Manufacturer | 2016 orders and deliveries[\[86\]](#cite_note-FGfleetwatch-86) |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| deliveries | values ($bn) | net orders | backlog |
| Boeing | 726 | 57.8 | 563 | 5,660 |

| Other | 31  | 0.5 | 72  | 1,080 |
| Total | 1,704 | 110.1 | 1,583 | 14,702 |

In 2016, the deliveries went for 38% in Asia-Pacific, 25% in Europe, 22% in North America, 7% in Middle East, 6% in South America and 2% in Africa. 1,020 narrowbodies were delivered and their backlog reach 10891: 4,991 A320neo, 644 A320ceo; 3,593 737 Max, 835 737NG, 348 CSeries, 305 C919 and 175 MC-21; while 398 widebodies were delivered : 137 Dreamliners and 99 B777 for Boeing (65%) against 63 A330 and 49 A350 for Airbus, more than 2,400 widebodies were in backlog, led by the A350 with 753 (31%) then the Boeing 787 with 694 (28%).[\[86\]](#cite_note-FGfleetwatch-86)

The most important driver of orders is airline [profitability](/wiki/Profitability "Profitability")
, itself driven mainly by world [GDP growth](/wiki/GDP_growth "GDP growth")
 but also [supply and demand](/wiki/Supply_and_demand "Supply and demand")
 balance and [oil prices](/wiki/Oil_price "Oil price")
, while new programmes by [Airbus and Boeing](/wiki/Airbus_and_Boeing "Airbus and Boeing")
 help to stimulate aircraft demand. In 2016, 38% of the 25 years old airliners had been retired, 50% of the 28 years old : there will be 523 aircraft reaching 25 years old in 2017, 1,127 in 2026 and 1,628 in 2041. Deliveries rose by 80% from 2004 to 2016, they represented 4.9% of the fleet in 2004 and 5.9% in 2016, down from 8% previously.[\[87\]](#cite_note-CAPA20June2017-87)
 Oil prices and [airshow](/wiki/Airshow "Airshow")
 orders are trending together.[\[88\]](#cite_note-88)

In 2020, deliveries were down by more than 50% compared to 2019 due to the [impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on aviation](/wiki/Impact_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic_on_aviation "Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on aviation")

Main article: [Aircraft cabin](/wiki/Aircraft_cabin "Aircraft cabin")

An airliner will usually have several classes of seating: [first class](/wiki/First_class_travel "First class travel")
, [business class](/wiki/Business_class "Business class")
, and/or [economy class](/wiki/Economy_class "Economy class")
 (which may be referred to as coach class or tourist class, and sometimes has a separate "premium" economy section with more legroom and amenities). The seats in more expensive classes are wider, more comfortable, and have more amenities such as "lie flat" seats for more comfortable sleeping on long flights. Generally, the more expensive the class, the better the beverage and meal service.

Domestic flights generally have a two-class configuration, usually first or business class and coach class, although many airlines instead offer all-economy seating. International flights generally have either a two-class configuration or a three-class configuration, depending on the airline, route and aircraft type. Many airliners offer [movies or audio/video](/wiki/In-flight_entertainment "In-flight entertainment")
 on demand (this is standard in first and business class on many international flights and may be available on economy). Cabins of all classes have [lavatory](/wiki/Aircraft_lavatory "Aircraft lavatory")
 facilities, reading lights, and [air vents](/wiki/Environmental_control_system#Air_distribution "Environmental control system")
. Some larger airliners have a [rest compartment](/wiki/Crew_rest_compartment "Crew rest compartment")
 reserved for crew use during breaks.

### Seats

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=24 "Edit section: Seats")\
\]

Main article: [Airline seat](/wiki/Airline_seat "Airline seat")

The types of seats that are provided and how much legroom is given to each passenger are decisions made by the individual airlines, not the aircraft manufacturers. Seats are mounted in "tracks" on the floor of the cabin and can be moved back and forth by the maintenance staff or removed altogether. One driver of airline profitability is how many passengers can be seated in economy class cabins, meaning that airline companies have an incentive to place seats close together to fit as many passengers in as possible.[\[91\]](#cite_note-91)
 In contrast, ‘premium class’ seat configurations provide more space for travelers.[\[92\]](#cite_note-92)

Passengers seated in an **exit row** (the row of seats adjacent to an [emergency exit](/wiki/Emergency_exit "Emergency exit")
) usually have substantially more legroom than those seated in the remainder of the cabin, while the seats directly in front of the exit row may have less legroom and may not even recline (for evacuation safety reasons). However, passengers seated in an exit row may be required to assist cabin crew during an [emergency evacuation](/wiki/Emergency_evacuation "Emergency evacuation")
 of the aircraft opening the emergency exit and assisting fellow passengers to the exit. As a precaution, many airlines prohibit young people under the age of 15 from being seated in the exit row.[\[93\]](#cite_note-93)

The seats are designed to withstand strong forces so as not to break or come loose from their floor tracks during [turbulence](/wiki/Turbulence "Turbulence")
 or accidents. The backs of seats are often equipped with a fold-down tray for eating, writing, or as a place to set up a portable computer, or a music or video player. Seats without another row of seats in front of them have a tray that is either folded into the armrest or that clips into brackets on the underside of the armrests. However, seats in premium cabins generally have trays in the armrests or clip-on trays, regardless of whether there is another row of seats in front of them. Seatbacks now often feature small colour [LCD](/wiki/LCD "LCD")
 screens for videos, television and video games. Controls for this display as well as an outlet to plug in audio headsets are normally found in the armrest of each seat.

### Overhead bins

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=25 "Edit section: Overhead bins")\
\]

Further information: [Overhead storage](/wiki/Overhead_storage "Overhead storage")

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Overhead_bins_%286389156645%29.jpg/250px-Overhead_bins_%286389156645%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:Overhead_bins_(6389156645).jpg)

Overhead bins aboard a [Sukhoi Superjet 100](/wiki/Sukhoi_Superjet_100 "Sukhoi Superjet 100")

The overhead bins, also known as overhead lockers or pivot bins, are used for stowing carry-on baggage and other items. While the airliner manufacturer will normally specify a standard version of the product to supply, airlines can choose to have bins of differing size, shape, or color installed. Over time, overhead bins evolved out of what were originally overhead shelves that were used for little more than coat and briefcase storage. As concerns about falling debris during turbulence or in accidents increased, enclosed bins became\[_[when?](/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers#Chronological_items "Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers")\
_\] the norm. Bins have increased in size to accommodate the larger carry-on baggage passengers can bring onto the aircraft. Newer bin designs have included a handrail, useful when moving through the cabin.[\[94\]](#cite_note-94)

### Passenger service units

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=26 "Edit section: Passenger service units")\
\]

Above the passenger seats are [Passenger Service Units](/wiki/Passenger_Service_Unit "Passenger Service Unit")
 (PSU). These typically contain reading lights, air vents, and a flight attendant call light. On most narrowbody aircraft (and some [Airbus A300s](/wiki/Airbus_A300 "Airbus A300")
 and [A310s](/wiki/Airbus_A310 "Airbus A310")
), the flight attendant call button and the buttons to control the reading lights are located directly on the PSU, while on most widebody aircraft, the flight attendant call button and the reading light control buttons are usually part of the [in-flight entertainment](/wiki/In-flight_entertainment "In-flight entertainment")
 system. The units frequently have small "Fasten Seat Belt" and "No Smoking" illuminated signage and may also contain a speaker for the cabin public address system. On some newer aircraft, a "Turn off electronic devices" sign is used instead of the "No Smoking" sign, as smoking isn't permitted on board the aircraft anyway.

The PSU will also normally contain the drop-down [oxygen masks](/wiki/Oxygen_mask "Oxygen mask")
 which are activated if there is a sudden drop in cabin pressure. These are supplied with oxygen by means of a [chemical oxygen generator](/wiki/Chemical_oxygen_generator "Chemical oxygen generator")
. By using a chemical reaction rather than a connection to an oxygen tank, these devices supply breathing oxygen for long enough for the airliner to descend to thicker, more breathable air. Oxygen generators do generate considerable heat in the process. Because of this, the oxygen generators are thermally shielded and are only allowed in commercial airliners when properly installed – they are not permitted to be loaded as freight on passenger-carrying flights. [ValuJet Flight 592](/wiki/ValuJet_Flight_592 "ValuJet Flight 592")
 crashed on May 11, 1996, as a result of improperly loaded chemical oxygen generators.

### Cabin pressurization

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=27 "Edit section: Cabin pressurization")\
\]

Main article: [Cabin pressurization](/wiki/Cabin_pressurization "Cabin pressurization")

Airliners developed since the 1940s have had pressurized cabins (or, more accurately, pressurized hulls including baggage holds) to enable them to carry passengers safely at high altitudes where low oxygen levels and air pressure would otherwise cause sickness or death. High altitude flight enabled airliners to fly above most weather systems that cause turbulent or dangerous flying conditions, and also to fly faster and further as there is less drag due to the lower air density. Pressurization is applied using compressed air, in most cases bled from the engines, and is managed by an [environmental control system](/wiki/Environmental_control_system "Environmental control system")
 which draws in clean air, and vents stale air out through a valve.

Pressurization presents design and construction challenges to maintain the structural integrity and sealing of the cabin and hull and to prevent [rapid decompression](/wiki/Rapid_decompression "Rapid decompression")
. Some of the consequences include small round windows, [doors that open inwards and are larger than the door hole](/wiki/Plug_door "Plug door")
, and an [emergency oxygen system](/wiki/Emergency_oxygen_system "Emergency oxygen system")
.

To maintain a pressure in the cabin equivalent to an altitude close to sea level would, at a cruising altitude around 10,000 m (33,000 ft), create a pressure difference between inside the aircraft and outside the aircraft that would require greater hull strength and weight. Most people do not suffer ill effects up to an altitude of 1,800–2,500 m (5,900–8,200 ft), and maintaining cabin pressure at this equivalent altitude significantly reduces the pressure difference and therefore the required hull strength and weight. A side effect is that passengers experience some discomfort as the cabin pressure changes during ascent and descent to the majority of airports, which are at low altitudes.

### Cabin climate control

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=28 "Edit section: Cabin climate control")\
\]

The air bled from the engines is hot and requires cooling by [air conditioning](/wiki/Air_conditioning "Air conditioning")
 units. It is also extremely dry at cruising altitude, and this causes sore eyes, dry skin and [mucosa](/wiki/Mucosa "Mucosa")
 on long flights. Although [humidification](/wiki/Humidifier "Humidifier")
 technology could raise its [relative humidity](/wiki/Relative_humidity "Relative humidity")
 to comfortable middle levels, this is not done since humidity promotes [corrosion](/wiki/Corrosion "Corrosion")
 to the inside of the hull and risks [condensation](/wiki/Condensation "Condensation")
 which could [short](/wiki/Short_circuit "Short circuit")
 electrical systems, so for safety reasons it is deliberately kept to a low value, around 10%. Another problem of the air coming from the ventilation (unto which the oil lubrication system of the engines is hooked up) is that fumes from components in the synthetic oils can sometimes travel along, causing passengers, pilots and crew to be intoxicated. The illness it causes is called [aerotoxic syndrome](/wiki/Aerotoxic_syndrome "Aerotoxic syndrome")
.

Baggage holds

 front lower compartment. Note the rollers for [ULDs](/wiki/Unit_Load_Device "Unit Load Device")
 on the floor and the partition labeled "Caution: Do Not Hit – Potable Water Tank Inside".

Airliners must have space on board to store "checked" baggage – that which will not safely fit in the passenger cabin.

Designed to hold baggage as well as freight, these compartments are called "cargo bins", "baggage holds", "luggage holds", or occasionally "pits". Occasionally baggage holds may be referred to as **cargo decks** on the largest of aircraft. These compartments can be accessed through doors on the outside of the aircraft.

Depending on the aircraft, baggage holds are normally inside the hull and are therefore pressurized just like the passenger cabin although they may not be heated. While lighting is normally installed for use by the loading crew, typically the compartment is unlit when the door is closed.

Baggage holds on modern airliners are equipped with fire detection equipment and larger aircraft have automated or remotely activated fire-fighting devices installed.

### Narrow-body airliners

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=30 "Edit section: Narrow-body airliners")\
\]

Most "[narrow-body](/wiki/Narrow-body_aircraft "Narrow-body aircraft")
" airliners with more than 100 seats have space below the cabin floor, while smaller aircraft often have a special compartment separate from the passenger area but on the same level.

Baggage is normally stacked within the bin by hand, sorted by destination category. Netting that fits across the width of the bin is secured to limit movement of the bags. Airliners often carry items of [freight](/wiki/Freight "Freight")
 and mail. These may be loaded separately from the baggage or mixed in if they are bound for the same destination. For securing bulky items "hold down" rings are provided to tie items into place.

### Wide-body airliners

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Airliner&action=edit&section=31 "Edit section: Wide-body airliners")\
\]

"[Wide-body](/wiki/Wide-body_aircraft "Wide-body aircraft")
" airliners frequently have a compartment like the ones described above, typically called a "bulk bin". It is normally used for late arriving luggage or bags which may have been checked at the gate.

However, most baggage and loose freight items are loaded into containers called [Unit Load Devices](/wiki/Unit_Load_Device "Unit Load Device")
 (ULDs), often referred to as "cans". ULDs come in a variety of sizes and shapes, but the most common model is the [LD3](/wiki/LD3 "LD3")
. This particular container has approximately the same height as the cargo compartment and fits across half of its width.

ULDs are loaded with baggage and are transported to the aircraft on [dolly carts](/wiki/Ground_support_equipment#Dollies "Ground support equipment")
 and loaded into the baggage hold by a loader designed for the task. By means of [belts](/wiki/Conveyor_belt "Conveyor belt")
 and [rollers](/w/index.php?title=Roller_(machine_part)&action=edit&redlink=1 "Roller (machine part) (page does not exist)")
 an operator can maneuver the ULD from the dolly cart, up to the aircraft baggage hold door, and into the aircraft. Inside the hold, the floor is also equipped with drive wheels and rollers that an operator inside can use to move the ULD properly into place. Locks in the floor are used to hold the ULD in place during flight.

For consolidated freight loads, like a pallet of boxes or an item too oddly shaped to fit into a container, flat metal pallets that resemble large baking sheets that are compatible with the loading equipment are used.

The Museum's collection holds a variety of different airplanes which help tell the story of flight. Our collection of commercial aircraft, such as the well-known Boeing 747, help tell the history of America by air. Learn more about some of these aircraft below. 

From the Wright Brothers to Today

The Airplane's Family Tree


------------------------------

Did you know that the parts of airplanes today can be traced directly back to the Wright Flyer and the work of Orville and Wilbur Wright? In this episode of STEM in 30, we trace the family tree of the airplane from that first flight on December 17, 1903, to today—all from inside a United Airlines 76.

Early Commercial Airliners
--------------------------

The story of commercial aviation starts with air mail. Commercial airlines initially struggled to get off the ground, but with help from the government, who awarded airlines contracts to deliver the mail, they soon began to flourish. As technology improved, aircraft evolved from World War I-style biplanes into sleek, high-performance modern airliners.

### Flying the Mail

![America by Air - Curtiss JN-4D Jenny](/sites/default/files/styles/callout_half/public/images/2007-13554h.jpg?h=ed802e08&itok=tWzV7mzM)

The Curtiss JN-4D Jenny


---------------------------

Early airlines were able to turn a profit through contracts with the federal government to fly the mail. Designed as a trainer for the U.S. Army Air Service, the Curtiss JN-4 first flew in 1916. Known popularly as the "Jenny," the JN-4 taught thousands of Allied pilots to fly during World War I. After the war, surplus Jennys were widely used for "barnstorming"—traveling air shows—and they opened the first scheduled air mail service. 

The JN-4D featured a 90-horsepower Curtiss OX-5 engine. The Army ordered Curtiss to convert six JN-4Ds for the U.S. Air Mail Service by installing a larger 150-horsepower Hispano-Suiza engine and a mail compartment. These airplanes were redesignated as JN-4Hs. The Smithsonian acquired this Jenny in 1918. 

[View Jenny record](https://airandspace.si.edu/collection-objects/curtiss-jn-4d-jenny/nasm_A19190006000)

### Who is Jenny?

The airplane's official name is the Curtiss JN-4. If you say the letters "JN" out loud, they sound like "Jay-En."  
That was shortened to "Jen," and it eventually was changed to "Jenny."

Of the more than 200 pilots hired by the Post Office from 1918 to 1926, 35 died flying the mail. Fatalities dropped after the first few years, but flying the mail remained a dangerous-and sometimes deadly-job.

[![View of red, U.S. Air Mail postage stamp that has an error of the Jenny biplane facing upside down.](/sites/default/files/styles/body_large/public/images/14102h.jpg?itok=MBm-nefV)](/multimedia-gallery/14102hjpg)

The Post Office created a series of air mail stamps featuring the Jenny when it began flying the mail. Post Office printers made a mistake when they first printed this stamp. Today very few of these rare "upside-down Jenny" stamps still exist. These famous stamps are worth a lot of money.

De Havilland DH-4


---------------------

By 1921 modified de Havilland DH-4 light bombers were being used as mail planes. They soon become the symbol of the U.S. Air Mail Service. 

The DH-4 in the Museum's collection was the prototype American-built DH-4, manufactured by the Dayton-Wright Airplane Company. This airplane was used in more than 2,600 experiments until its retirement in April 1919. On May 13, 1918, Orville Wright made his last flight as a pilot in a 1911 Wright Model B alongside this DH-4, flown by Howard Max Rinehart. He then made a flight as a passenger in the DH-4 with Rinehart.

### Flying Passengers

Many [early airlines](https://airandspace.si.edu/stories/editorial/early-airlines-you-might-not-have-heard)
 attempted to make a profitable business from transporting passengers, but every one of these efforts failed due to high operating costs. Even after the government gave private airlines contracts to fly the mail, it was still difficult for airlines to make passenger flight profitable—resulting in [further subsidies](https://airandspace.si.edu/stories/editorial/air-mail-and-birth-commercial-aviation)
 from the federal government to encourage airlines to carry more passengers.

[![Wooden biplane-airboat model with space for two people, a passenger and the pilot. Flaglets are placed on the front structure in between the wings.](/sites/default/files/styles/body_large/public/images/14081h.jpg?itok=Zl93ospv)](/multimedia-gallery/14081hjpg)

A model of the Benoist Model XIV. The Benoist was powered by a Roberts 75-horsepower, 6-cylinder, water-cooled engine. In 1914, the trip across the bay cost $5—more than $100 today. 

### Benoist Model XIV

Many early airlines utilized flying boats for passenger service. The St. Petersburg-Tampa Airboat Line began flying across Tampa Bay on January 1, 1914. The flight covered 29 kilometers (18 miles) and took 23 minutes—11 hours less than traveling between St. Petersburg and Tampa by rail. The airline purchased a Model XIV from St. Louis aircraft manufacturer Thomas Benoist. The airplane could carry one passenger, who sat next to the pilot in the open cockpit.

Ford Tri-Motor


------------------

Affectionately known as the “Tin Goose,” the Ford Tri-Motor was the largest civil aircraft in America when it first flew on August 2, 1926. Its all-metal, corrugated aluminum construction and the prestigious Ford name made it immediately popular with passengers and airline operators. Noisy but reliable, the Ford Tri-Motor played a major role in convincing the public that air travel was safe and practical.

### Curtiss Condor 

First flown in 1932, the Curtiss Condor could carry 14 passengers and had sleeping berths for night flight. Although comfortable and fast, it was expensive to operate. Eastern Air Transport and American Airways flew the Condor, but newer designs soon replaced it.

A model of the Boeing 40A.

### Boeing 40A

Powered by Pratt & Whitney's Wasp engine, the Boeing 40A could carry two passengers. Thanks to the biplane's large payload capacity and low operating costs, Boeing Air Transport won the coveted air mail route from Chicago to San Francisco in 1927 and operated the route at a profit.

Boeing developed a larger version of the aircraft, the Boeing 40B, which could carry 4,400 kilograms (2,000 pounds) of mail and four passengers. The pilot flew the airplane from an open cockpit behind the passenger compartment.

The First Modern Airliners
--------------------------

With help from the government via air mail contracts and other subsidies, commercial aviation in the United States began to take route. However, the mid-1930s were a difficult time for airlines. The federal government had broken up the large companies that had dominated the aviation industry and had cut its subsidies to airlines. Air transportation regulation was in a state of confusion. Improvements in aircraft and aviation technology played a key role in revitalizing the struggling airline industry.

To survive in these challenging times, airlines needed bigger, better, and faster airplanes that could profitably fly passengers as well as mail. New navigation and communications equipment was also required to enhance safety and efficiency. The aviation industry responded. By the late 1930s, the first modern, high-performance airliners were taking to the air.

![Image of the Boeing 247-D](/sites/default/files/styles/callout_half/public/images/image-albums/Boeing%20247-D.jpg?h=1dd3cf61&itok=wQeo249y)

Boeing 247


--------------

The government provided bonuses to airlines if their aircraft could fly at night or had multiple engines, two-way radios, and other equipment that promoted safety and speed. The first aircraft produced under these terms was the Boeing 247 in 1933, the world's first modern airliner. It could carry 10 passengers, fly 50 percent faster than the Ford Tri-Motor, and cross the country in less than 20 hours. The Boeing 247 revolutionized air transportation, featuring a sleek, low-wing, all-metal construction; retractable landing gear; and supercharged, air-cooled engines. Its innovative design launched a new generation of commercial airliners, notably the Douglas DC-2. The Boeing 247-D, the version in the Museum's collection, pioneered the use of controllable-pitch propellers and wing de-icer boots.

A model of the China Clipper. When the _China Clipper_ opened Pan Am's transpacific air mail route in 1935 and passenger service in 1936, it became one of the most famous airplanes in the world. Pan Am's other flying boats were known as the _Hawaii Clipper_ and the _Philippine Clipper_.

### China Clipper

The _China Clipper_ was the name of one of three Martin M-130 flying boats built for Pan American Airways, the United States' primary international airline during the 1930s. The Martin M-130 was the first airliner that could fly nonstop the 3,840-kilometer (2,400-mile) distance between San Francisco and Honolulu, Hawaii—the longest major route in the world without and emergency intermediate landing field. The _China Clipper_ and its sister ships demonstrated that there were no technological barriers to transoceanic travel.

Boeing 307 Stratoliner


--------------------------

The Boeing 307 Stratoliner was the world's first pressurized airliner. While other airliners flew no higher than about 3,000 meters (10,000 feet), the Stratoliner could cruise at 7,500 meters (25,000 feet). By ascending "above the weather," it could fly faster and more efficiently and provide its 33 passengers a smoother and quieter ride. Because of the onset of World War II and the development of improved designs, only 10 Stratoliners were built. The last one, Pan American's Clipper Flying Cloud, is housed in the Museum's collection.

### Four-Engine Propeller Planes

Aircraft manufacturers introduced a new generation of large, four-engine airliners after World War II that soon dominated U.S. and international air travel and helped lower fares. These new airliners were built with profitable transcontinental air routes in mind. They enabled airlines to carry far more people at greater speeds, while providing unprecedented comfort for passengers and unprecedented profits for airlines. As a result, competition increased and fares fell, thus opening up air travel to even more people.

[![Lockheed Super Constellation L-1049F](/sites/default/files/styles/body_large/public/images/4485h.jpg?itok=IR0qiF20 "Lockheed Super Constellation L-1049F")](/multimedia-gallery/4485hjpg)

The Museum's "Connie" was used by the military. It was retired in 1977 after 21½ years of military service, thousands of flying hours, and countless ocean crossings.

### Lockheed Constellation and Super Constellation

Sleek, powerful, and graceful, TWA's Lockheed Constellations introduced pressurized comfort and shortened transcontinental travel by an astounding five hours. Eastern began flying the "stretched" 71-seat Super Constellation in 1951. The L-1049C and strengthened L-1049G versions had greater range and capacity than the original "Connie." Northwest Orient and TWA also flew Super Constellations.

Douglas DC-7


----------------

The Douglas DC-7 was an advanced development of the DC-6B piston-engine airliner. It was introduced by American Airlines on its New York-Los Angeles route in November 1953 and was the first airliner to provide nonstop transcontinental service in both directions. 

The fastest transport aircraft in service, the DC-7 cruised at 580 kilometers (360 miles) per hour. A total of 338 DC-7s of all types were purchased by 18 different airlines. Like other piston-engine airliners, it was made obsolete by the introduction of turbine-engine Boeing 707s and Douglas DC-8s. Some DC-7s later served as cargo and charter planes. 

This nose section from the Museum's collection is from American Airlines' Flagship Vermont, which carried about 130,000 passengers in its nearly 13,500 hours aloft.

Jet Airliners
-------------

The jet engine revolutionized air travel. Powerful and durable, jets enabled aircraft manufacturers to build bigger, faster, and more productive airliners. Jet technology also enabled airlines to reduce their operating costs and their airfares. Jet passenger service began in the United States in the late 1950s with the introduction of Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8 airliners. 

Jet engines have far fewer moving parts than piston engines, so they are more reliable, safer, and less costly to operate. They burn kerosene, which is less expensive than gasoline, and produce tremendous thrust for their weight. As a result, jet aircraft can be made larger and can fly faster than piston-engine aircraft.

First introduced in 1948, the Rolls-Royce Dart turboprop combined the power of jet propulsion with the efficiency of propellers. It was widely used in the first generation of turboprop-powered aircraft, including the British Vickers Viscount and the Dutch Fokker F-27. The Dart enabled these and other new airliners to lower airline operating costs and bring greater speed and comfort to passengers traveling on short-to-medium length routes.

Boeing 707


--------------

On July 15, 1954, a graceful, swept-winged aircraft, bedecked in brown and yellow paint and powered by four revolutionary new engines first took to the sky above Seattle. Built by the Boeing Aircraft Company, the 367-80, better known as the Dash 80, would come to revolutionize commercial air transportation when its developed version entered service as the famous Boeing 707, America's first jet airliner.

Boeing's 707 was designed for transcontinental or one-stop transatlantic range. But modified with extra fuel tanks and more efficient turbofan engines, 707-300s could fly nonstop across the Atlantic. Boeing built 855 707s. 

_Pictured: The Museum's Boeing 367-80, or Dash 80, the prototype for the Boeing 707._

An operating, 1/4-scale model of a Pratt & Whitney JT3C (military designation J57) turbojet engine.

The Pratt & Whitney JT3 revolutionized air transportation when it entered service on the Boeing 707 in 1958. The new turbojet engine was a commercial version of the U.S. Air Force's J53, introduced in 1950. In the early 1960s, the JT3 was modified into a low-bypass turbofan-the JT3D. The first three compressor stages were replaced with two fan stages, which extended beyond the compressor casing to act like propellers. The resulting increase in airflow lowered fuel consumption, noise, and emissions. JT3Ds became widely used, especially on long-range Boeing 707-300s and Douglas DC-8s.

Boeing 747


--------------

Designed originally for Pan American to replace the 707, the giant Boeing 747 revolutionized long-distance air travel when it entered service in 1970. Carrying more than twice the passengers than the 189-seat 707, the 400-seat 747 offered dramatically lower seat-mile costs and therefore much greater efficiency. Propelled by four powerful and efficient high-bypass turbofan engines, the so-called "Jumbo Jet" spawned a new generation of wide-body airliners from Airbus, Lockheed, McDonnell Douglas, and later Boeing. 

The Boeing 747 generated great public interest because of its enormous size. Airlines offered spacious legroom, piano bars, and lounges aboard their 747s to encourage passengers to fly. These amenities quickly disappeared in the face of economic reality and were replaced by revenue-producing seats. 

First flown in 1970, the Museum's 747 was the first built for Northwest and the first 747 to open service across the Pacific. It was retired in 1999.

If the entire Boeing 747 were on display, its tail would extend all the way back to the far wall of the _Boeing Milestones of Flight Hall_. Note: configuration of the Museum's galleries are subject to change.

### Varying Versions

In response to market requirements, the design of the Boeing 747 has evolved through a series of models that have greater range or capacity. The 747-400 can fly 416 passengers a range of 13,450 kilometers (8,360 miles). It features an extended upper deck and winglets. The 747-8 adds about 5.6 meters (18 feet) of fuselage and has engines derived from the Boeing 787. It can carry about 467 people a distance of 14,800 kilometers (9,200 miles).

Concorde


------------

The future of commercial aviation appeared to be the supersonic transport (SST), an airliner that could fly faster than sound. U.S. advocates hoped to build a larger and faster SST to compete with the British and French Concorde and the Soviet Tupolev Tu-144.  

But concerns about huge development and operational costs, high fuel consumption, drastically high fares, and sonic booms and other environmental issues proved insurmountable. U.S. airlines placed no orders for Boeing's 2707 SST, Congress withdrew support, and the project died. 

Introduced in 1976, the Concorde was the first and only operational supersonic transport. It could carry 100 passengers across the Atlantic in less than four hours, but its airfares were extremely expensive. All 14 Concordes that went into service were purchased by the British and French governments for their national airlines. Concordes stopped flying in 2003.

A Supersonic Dead End? Not so Fast.


---------------------------------------

Fifty years after the Concorde first flew, a new era of innovation and entrepreneurial ideas seeks to make supersonic flight practical and sustainable. Flying passengers at twice the speed of sound, the Concorde captured the imagination of millions, but was retired in 2003 — so what's next for supersonic flight? From reducing the sonic boom to a quiet thump to the possible pathways for supersonic to return to commercial aviation, join us for a discussion on the supersonic airliner that started it all and where we’re headed next.

```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
CNN published an article on April 16, 2025, discussing the capture of Chinese nationals fighting on the Russian side in Ukraine (<image:i>), and The Guardian published an article on May 9, 2025, discussing the Victory Day parade in Moscow, where Chinese troops marched with Russian forces (<image:3184>, <image:3185>, <image:3188>). The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and the International Committee of the Red Cross published a report on the Red Cross Red Crescent Movement's response to the Russia-Ukraine international armed conflict, mentioning the Ukrainian Red Cross Society, the Russian Red Cross Society, and the Red Cross Society of China (<image:1>).


### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The reverse image search found the image in the following sources: Wikipedia's article on airliners ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airliner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airliner)) and the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum ([https://airandspace.si.edu/explore/stories/evolution-commercial-airliner](https://airandspace.si.edu/explore/stories/evolution-commercial-airliner)). The Merriam-Webster dictionary also contains the image ([https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/airliner](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/airliner)). <image:6>


# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that the image is of an airliner, as indicated by the reverse image search results from Wikipedia, the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum, and Merriam-Webster. The search results also show that Chinese troops marched with Russian forces in Moscow. The Red Cross Society of China is mentioned in a report about the Russia-Ukraine conflict. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that the image shows Chinese Red Cross troops setting off for the Russian-Ukrainian front.

_________________________



JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

The Merriam-Webster dictionary also contains the image ([https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/airliner](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/airliner)). <image:6>


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the image is of an airliner, as indicated by the reverse image search results from Wikipedia, the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum, and Merriam-Webster. The search results also show that Chinese troops marched with Russian forces in Moscow. The Red Cross Society of China is mentioned in a report about the Russia-Ukraine conflict. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that the image shows Chinese Red Cross troops setting off for the Russian-Ukrainian front.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is not supported by the evidence. The image is of an airliner, and there is no evidence to suggest that it depicts Chinese Red Cross troops. The search results mention Chinese troops marching with Russian forces and the Red Cross Society of China's involvement in the conflict, but they do not validate the specific claim made about the image. `false`

The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and the International Committee of the Red Cross published a report on the Red Cross Red Crescent Movement's response to the Russia-Ukraine international armed conflict, mentioning the Ukrainian Red Cross Society, the Russian Red Cross Society, and the Red Cross Society of China (<image:1>).


### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The reverse image search found the image in the following sources: Wikipedia's article on airliners ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airliner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airliner)) and the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum ([https://airandspace.si.edu/explore/stories/evolution-commercial-airliner](https://airandspace.si.edu/explore/stories/evolution-commercial-airliner)). The Merriam-Webster dictionary also contains the image ([https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/airliner](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/airliner)). <image:6>


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the image is of an airliner, as indicated by the reverse image search results from Wikipedia, the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum, and Merriam-Webster. The search results also show that Chinese troops marched with Russian forces in Moscow. The Red Cross Society of China is mentioned in a report about the Russia-Ukraine conflict. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that the image shows Chinese Red Cross troops setting off for the Russian-Ukrainian front.


## Final Judgement
The claim is not supported by the evidence. The image is of an airliner, and there is no evidence to suggest that it depicts Chinese Red Cross troops. The search results mention Chinese troops marching with Russian forces and the Red Cross Society of China's involvement in the conflict, but they do not validate the specific claim made about the image. `false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is false. While the search results show that Chinese troops marched with Russian forces and the Red Cross Society of China is involved in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the image in the claim is of an airliner, and there is no evidence to support the assertion that it depicts Chinese Red Cross troops.

**A network of Russia-based websites masquerading as local American newspapers is pumping out fake stories as part of an AI-powered operation that is increasingly targeting the US election, a BBC investigation can reveal.**

**A former Florida police officer who relocated to Moscow is one of the key figures behind it.**

The following would have been a bombshell report - if it were true.

Olena Zelenska, the first lady of Ukraine, allegedly bought a rare Bugatti Tourbillon sports car for 4.5m euros ($4.8m; £3.8m) while visiting Paris for D-Day commemorations in June. Bugatti issued a sharp denial, [calling it "fake news"](https://www.instagram.com/stories/bugatti_paris/3403151154050783240/)
, and its Paris dealership threatened legal action against the people behind the false story.

But before the truth could even get its shoes on, the lie had gone viral.

A Bugatti car, a first lady and the fake stories aimed at Americans

! <image:1733>!A fake version of an invoice from a Bugatti dealership, with a "FAKE" stamp on it <image:1736>

Several errors - including spelling mistakes, punctuation and the use of English - were noticed on this fake invoice. Some have been roundly ignored but others have been shared by influencers and members of the US Congress.

The story of the Bugatti hit many of the top themes of the operation – Ukrainian corruption, US aid spending, and the inner workings of French high society.

Another fake which went viral earlier this year was more directly aimed at American politics.

It was published on a website called The Houston Post – one of dozens of sites with American-sounding names which are in reality run from Moscow - and alleged that the FBI illegally wiretapped Donald Trump’s Florida resort.

It played neatly into Trump’s allegations that the legal system is unfairly stacked against him, that there is a conspiracy to thwart his campaign, and that his opponents are using dirty tricks to undermine him. On Tuesday, he denied any knowledge of the story about the Bugatti sports car.

But at other times he has bragged about his prowess in spreading fake news.

At one point he also implied that his activities are a form of revenge against American authorities.

“For me it’s a game," he said. <image:1733>!YouTube Screenshot of a YouTube video featuring false claims that Mr Zelensky bought a mansion from King Charles III <image:1748>YouTube

A YouTube video narrated by an AI-generated voice was planted as the source for the false story that Mr Zelensky bought a £20m mansion from King Charles III

Microsoft researchers also say the operation is attempting to spread stories about UK politics – with an eye on Thursday’s general election – and the Paris Olympics.

One fake story – which appeared on the website called the London Crier – claimed that Mr Zelensky bought a mansion owned by King Charles III at a bargain price.

It was seen by hundreds of thousands of users on X, and shared by an official Russian embassy account."

Content: "Car Lovers Group said the invoice is not theirs, and it contains errors that show it's fabricated, including the lack of required legal details and an incorrect price for the vehicle. 

Russian [disinformation networks](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-targets-americans-traveling-to-paris-olympics-with-fake-cia-video/)
 have spread similar false claims about Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his family in the past year, including a false claim that he bought two luxury yachts for millions of dollars, and a false claim that Zelenska bought over $1 million worth of jewelry at Cartier in New York City.

Clément Briens, a senior threat intelligence analyst for cybersecurity company Recorded Future, told CBS News that false stories about corruption are created to undermine Western support for Ukraine and "erode trust in the leaders, their institutions, and international alliances."

The falsehoods play into existing [concerns](https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2023/index/ukr)
 and documented reports about corruption in Ukraine, researchers say.

Darren Linvill, a Russian disinformation expert and professor at Clemson University in South Carolina, said the false claims are "framed for a very particular audience that wants to hear and is ready to hear that and repeat it."

Linvill said the narratives have managed to gain traction online, despite being debunked — likely because of the cost and status of the brand used by the network. Bugatti Paris — which is operated by Autofficina Parigi, a Car Lovers Group company — [said](https://www.instagram.com/p/C86tVZWKjLS/?hl=en&img_index=2)

 video that falsely claims the first lady of Ukraine, Olena Zelenska, purchased a $4.8 million Bugatti sports car has racked up millions of views on social media, CBS News has found. The video is part of a Russian disinformation campaign aimed at degrading Western support for Ukraine, researchers said. 

CBS News determined the video was [created using artificial intelligence](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-targets-americans-traveling-to-paris-olympics-with-fake-cia-video/)

Olena Zelenska, the wife of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in Kyiv on June 18, 2024.

Ukrinform/Cover Images/AP/File

London CNN  — 

A deepfake video that wrongly suggested the wife of [Ukrainian](https://www.cnn.com/world/europe/ukraine)
 President Volodymyr Zelensky purchased a luxury car during the couple’s visit to Paris last month is likely part of a Russian-linked disinformation network, according to CNN’s analysis and disinformation experts.

The AI-generated [video](https://x.com/aussiecossack/status/1807774973047758873)
 features a non-existent employee of the Bugatti dealership in Paris claiming Olena Zelenska purchased its new model, the Bugatti Tourbillon, for 4.5 million euros (around $4.8 million) on June 7.

The clip has several markings of a deep fake, from cuts in the video, to the strange accent and lip-and-mouth movements, according to Clément Briens, a researcher at cybersecurity company Recorded Future. Yet, it gathered some 18 million views in 24 hours on X, where it was reposted by pro-[Russian](https://www.cnn.com/world/europe/russia)
 influencers.

Bugatti said in a statement on Tuesday that its dealership in Paris, operated by Autofficina Parigi, a Car Lovers Group company, was victim of several criminal offenses and “firmly denounced this disinformation campaign.”

“A supposed salesman claiming to belong to the Car Lovers Group and its sports label Schumacher Group, published a video on social networks in which he indicated that the Bugatti Paris dealership sold a vehicle to the Ukrainian presidential couple,” it said, adding that the group “strongly denies both the existence of the transaction and, consequently, the existence of the invoice.”

“The mandatory legal details don’t appear on the invoice, the price of the vehicle is also wrong, the price of the options and their descriptions are inaccurate and inconsistent, the graphics are outdated, and the Car Lovers Group would never have allowed such a document to be issued,” the statement added.

The group also said it has taken legal action “by filing a criminal complaint for forgery, use of forgeries, usurpation of identity and defamation” – but did not specify against whom the complaint was filed.

Clarity, an AI cybersecurity startup that is fighting against deepfakes, told CNN that their review of the video indicated “a high certainty for AI manipulations, mostly around the middle of the face area.”

The video originates from a French-language website, Verite Cachee France (sic), whose content appears to be AI-generated by scraping French media.

A CNN analysis shows Verite Cachee was set up recently, on June 22, 2024, and some of its pages still have prompts with AI to create fake articles at the top of the piece. “Only minor change with this campaign is that the video doesn’t seem to be on YouTube.”

 [](https://tigerprints.clemson.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1002&context=mfh_reports)
from last December, Linvill and Patrick Warren, also a professor at Clemson, showed how the disinformation campaign was led by DC Weekly, a website that published a series of AI-generated Russian propaganda and fake stories, such as the debunked claim that Olena Zelenska bought $1.1 million jewellery at Cartier in New York last September.

A [report by Recorded Future](https://www.recordedfuture.com/russian-and-iranian-influence-networks-target-french-elections)
, a leading cybersecurity company, also identified Veritee Cachee as being part of the same disinformation network.

Given the size and resources of the network, it is likely some Russian support or financing is happening, Clément Briens, a senior threat intelligence analyst at the company, told CNN.

“They scrape articles automatically from a number of sources, using LLMs to introduce specifically political bias to attack Zelensky, Biden and NATO."

*   Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with leaders at the Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum, which takes place from 15–19 January in Davos, Switzerland.
*   In his special address and during a closed-door session, he called on business leaders to invest in Ukraine: “Because people need jobs.”
*   Amid the challenge of war, the country has been undertaking a host of business-friendly reforms and saw GDP grow by more than 5% in 2023.

When Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, there was an expectation that the country would quickly capitulate that was [echoed by many analysts](https://www.businessinsider.com/biggest-surprises-russia-putins-months-long-devastating-war-ukraine-2022-12?r=US&IR=T)
.

As Klaus Schwab, Founder and Executive Chairman of the World Economic Forum, reminded participants at the 2024 Annual Meeting in Davos, that is not how things played out. ![Volodymyr Zelenskyy, President of Ukraine, addresses participants at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2024.](https://assets.weforum.org/article/image/ID94BLyjYVb6YAygjEt_oWBYdsCbftJhLHvS9wOl1OA.jpg)

That’s largely, Schwab pointed out, because of the country’s resilience in the face of aggression. “Business investment is so necessary,” Zelenskyy said in a closed-door session that brought together over 70 global CEOs from among the Forum’s partner companies. And while Ukraine’s economy [fell by almost 30%](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraines-gdp-fell-291-2022-during-russias-invasion-2023-04-13/#:~:text=KYIV%2C%20April%2013%20(Reuters),Moscow's%20Feb.)
 in 2022, following Russia’s invasion, this past year it grew by over 5%, Zelenskyy told participants in his special address. It’s also because of the [billions it has received in aid from the US](https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-aid-has-us-sent-ukraine-here-are-six-charts)
 and [Europe](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/infographics/eu-solidarity-ukraine/)
.

Today, Zelenskyy called for a different kind of investment: from the private sector."

**What was claimed:** A photo shows President Volodymyr Zelenskyy recently wearing a suit to meet WEF founder Klaus Schwab because he is his “actual boss”, amid criticism Mr Zelenskyy received for not wearing one to meet President Trump.

**Our verdict:** This photo shows the two men in suits in 2020, before Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, after which President Zelenskyy stopped wearing suits publicly.

Advertisement The post suggests President Zelenskyy recently wore one to meet Mr Schwab, but not Mr Trump.

But this is missing important context. Mr Zelenskyy does not appear to have worn a suit in public since the day of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022—he [shared a video](https://t.me/V_Zelenskiy_official/725)
 that day in which he wore a suit—but the photo with Mr Schwab predates this.

The photo [circulating online](https://www.facebook.com/SteveLawsonOfficial/posts/pfbid034ZpTJjHyGodjv2q1sqKqvuxxNgBA8MT2yPjFJ1MpryoL5TMDaXKc9MMC7YVTNP1al)
 shows Mr Zelenskyy and Mr Schwab both in suits, and shaking hands in front of a backdrop featuring the WEF logo. Since the Russian invasion, [Mr Zelenskyy](https://openverse.org/image/ca159444-4cbe-4681-b9e5-68c79391bf29?q=zelenskyy+recently&p=7)

 more militaristic, dressed-down attire, including sweatshirts that often feature the [Ukrainian trident symbol](https://ukraine.ua/stories/trident-tryzub/)
.

In an [interview with the BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m001jv9l)
 in February 2023, [Mr Zelenskyy said](https://youtu.be/HSRjeluwkOY?si=Gdh1A8Aq--Kd9G-3&t=554)
 about his decision to stop wearing suits: “It was more comfortable and more understandable for people. And it's very strange when it’s a war and you’re in a suit.”.

In response to a question from a US journalist at the recent meeting in Washington, Mr Zelenskyy [said](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1d4r9yvqzpo#:~:text=%22I%20will%20wear%20costume%20after%20this%20war%20will%20finish%2C%22%20Zelensky%20replied.%20(The%20word%20%22suit%22%20can%20be%20translated%20into%20Ukrainian%20as%20%22kostyum%22.))
: “I will wear costume after this war will finish,” (a Ukrainian word for “suit” is “kostyum”).

It’s not exactly clear what the post means about Mr Schwab being Mr Zelenskyy’s “actual boss”, but we could find no evidence to support this. It has been captioned: “The only time Zelensky will wear a suit is when he meets his actual Boss!”

But this is not a recent photo."

During her four years at Fox News, Aubrie Spady helped [lead](https://www.foxnews.com/person/s/aubrie-spady)
 the conservative news outlet’s energy and environmental coverage, consistently elevating the voices of those pushing Trump’s “energy dominance” agenda and condemning President Joe Biden’s climate and conservation policies.

In January, Spady wrote [a story](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/burgum-grilled-environmental-issues-targeted-by-trump-drill-baby-drill)
 on Doug Burgum’s nomination to serve as President Donald Trump’s Interior Secretary, focusing on his pledge to “drill, baby, drill.” Once Burgum was confirmed to the powerful post in February, Spady shifted to friendly coverage of how the former North Dakota governor was “[taking aim](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/exciting-chapter-interior-sec-takes-aim-biden-oil-lease-ban-coercive-climate-policies-day-1-orders)
” at the Biden administration’s environmental and climate policies. Her father, David Spady, is a longtime conservative operative and media consultant who [maintains extraordinary access](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ryan-zinke-wildlife-conservation-montana-david-spady_n_5b153d81e4b010565aadf457)
 to Trump administration officials and GOP lawmakers, which he documents in detail on his public Instagram page.

During Trump’s first term, then-Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke tapped David Spady to serve on an advisory panel focused on hunting, shooting sports and big game conservation, as I [reported](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ryan-zinke-wildlife-conservation-montana-david-spady_n_5b153d81e4b010565aadf457)
 for HuffPost at the time.

Much of Aubrie Spady’s reporting at Fox appeared to dovetail with her father’s work, marked by the same animosity he has for government regulation and the environmental and climate movements.

She wrote about [California water use](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/smelt-test-trump-order-overrides-californias-fish-protecting-rules-maximize-water-supply)

 in January titled “Smelt test: Trump order overrides California's fish-protecting rules to maximize water supply.” In 2014, her father produced a documentary about California’s water shortage, which he blamed on “[radical environmentalists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAwS-bwniiM)
” and Washington bureaucrats who he said had prioritized protecting the delta smelt, an imperiled fish, over the needs of farmers.

In May of this year, a month or so after Spady was hired onto Burgum’s communications team, David Spady celebrated her new federal career, posting pictures of the two of them at Interior’s headquarters in Washington, DC.

“After four years with FOX News, Aubrie joined the Trump Administration. [#ProudDad](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/prouddad/)

I think those Department of Interior videos are godawful propaganda. And a few weeks into Burgum’s tenure, Spady landed [an “exclusive” stor](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/federal-department-cafeteria-empty-years-under-biden-source)
y about how the Interior Department cafeteria had remained shuttered during Biden’s presidency — a piece that cited “a source close to the situation” and included a statement from Burgum in which he bemoaned how few people were showing up to the office.

Burgum and his team seem to have liked what they saw from the young reporter. In 2013, her father produced a documentary, titled “[Wolves in Government Clothing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPZXevpiGBg)
,” in which he argued that wolves and people are “incompatible” and that the Endangered Species Act has empowered “predators” in government to “destroy people’s lives.”

At the time of both films, David Spady was California state director of Americans for Prosperity, a right-wing political advocacy group that fossil fuel tycoons David and Charles Koch founded in 2004.

Then there are her father’s friends and allies in the GOP, some of whom Spady seemingly had easy access to while working as a Fox News reporter. Spady [authored](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ryan-zinke-wins-re-election-montana-first-congressional-district)
 the Fox News story on Zinke’s victory.

Spady also landed [exclusive interviews](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kevin-mccarthy-blasts-biden-doj-trump-indictment-dark-day-america)
 with former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), [another close contact](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ryan-zinke-wildlife-conservation-montana-david-spady_n_5b153d81e4b010565aadf457)
 of her father’s, [and Daines](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/montana-senate-race-majority-intense-ground-game-operation-nrsc-chairman)
 while he was chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee.

When Trump was re-elected to the White House in November, David Spady was at the election-night watch party in West Palm Beach, Florida."

Content: "This time, they posted a fake about “the Ukrainian Center for Psychological and Information War received \[from USAID\] funds amounting to $140 million monthly.” Our fact-checking department debunked this news.

What happened? 
---------------

On Feb 12, the Telegram channel [Медведь](https://t.me/bear007/62493?single)
 (“Bear,” [archive](https://archive.ph/f2kqp)
), which regularly spreads Russian disinformation, published a post from American Fox News publication, “Psychological and Information Warfare Center of Ukraine \[PIWCU\] received $140,000,000 per month from USAID.”

!зображення до посту: Debunking Russian fakes. No, Fox News didn’t write about Ukraine&#8217;s center for information operations receiving $140M per month from the USAID  <image:1806>

We’ve checked the [official website](https://www.foxnews.com/)
 of Fox News and figured out that the article is absent from the list of [Aubrie Spady’s publications](https://www.foxnews.com/person/s/aubrie-spady?msockid=24fc82c6537363ae340d97415261625e)
. 

On Feb 10, the author didn’t publish anything mentioning the Ukrainian psychological and information operation center. The biggest amount of funds went to economic and humanitarian projects and to financing programs for encouraging democracy and protecting human rights, which is confirmed by the reports from the USA (the totals are shown per year). 

!The reports about funding from USAID to Ukraine in 2024 / Screenshot: foreignassistance.gov <image:1809>

The reports about funding from USAID to Ukraine in 2024 / Screenshot: foreignassistance.gov

In the end, we checked the information about the operations of centers of information-psychological operations in Ukraine, one of which is mentioned in the post of propagandists. 

The official website of Ukraine’s Ministry of Defence notes that information-psychological operations are the [area of responsibility](https://mod.gov.ua/pro-nas/sili-speczialnih-operaczij)
 of the Forces of Special Operations. No, Fox News didn’t write about Ukraine&#8217;s center for information operations receiving $140M per month from the USAID  <image:1805>

Analysis
--------

As evidence, Telegram authors added what seems to be an article by Fox News: its author is Aubrie Spady, and the date of the article’s publication is Feb 10, 2025.

His full quote is: "If Ukraine loses, Russia is going to enter Baltic states, NATO states, then the US will have to send their sons and daughters exactly in the same way as we are sending our sons and daughters to war."

Did USAID pay for pro-Ukrainian bots and fakes about Russia?
------------------------------------------------------------

**Claim:** Fox News reported that USAID pays $140 million per month to Ukraine's Psychological and Information Warfare Center to create pro-Ukrainian bots and fake news about Russia.

A manipulated screenshot of an alleged Fox News article dated February 10, 2025 has circulated on social media —including [X](https://archive.ph/sqt7Z "External link — X")
, [Reddit](https://archive.ph/ibFZR "External link — Reddit")
, [Telegram](https://archive.ph/f2kqp "External link — Telegram")
, and [Facebook](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/jhCqq "External link — Facebook")
. The altered image claims USAID funds Ukraine's "Psychological and Information Warfare Center" at a rate of $140 million per month. A 2024 [report (pages 24–27)](https://media.defense.gov/2025/Feb/14/2003647338/-1/-1/1/OAR_Q1_DEC2024_FINAL_508_2.PDF "External link — report (pages 24–27)")
 by the Special Inspector General to the US Congress, which monitored government activity related to Ukraine between 2022 and 2024, explained Congress appropriated $182.75 billion for Ukraine-related efforts. USAID's share was approximately $39.9 billion, with the bulk allocated to humanitarian aid, governance programs, and public service support.

There was no mention of a $140-million-per-month disbursement to a "Psychological and Information Warfare Center."

If USAID were spending $140 million per month (roughly $1.68 billion annually) on a single program, that amount would dwarf the agency's entire budget for operating expenses, inspection, and health programs combined during the same period.

According to [the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense](https://archive.ph/UkbYb "External link — the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense")
, the "psychological operations unit" is part of its Special Operations Forces (SOF). The timestamp in the screenshot matches [a different report](https://archive.ph/XKPDO "External link — a different report")
, indicating that the image was repurposed to spread the false claim.

Ukrainian President [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](/en/volodymyr-zelenskyy/t-65603134)
 has been a target of pro-Russian propaganda for years, but a fresh wave of accusations and defamation against him and his country is surging online.

This latest disinformation campaign was fueled by a [recent dispute in the Oval Office](/en/trump-zelenskyy-white-house-fight-ukrainian-reactions/a-71795975)
 between Zelenskyy, [US President Donald Trump](/en/donald-trump/t-19434433)
 and Vice-President [JD Vance](/en/jd-vance/t-70177094)
.

"NewsGuard has seen a significant increase in false claims about Ukraine on US social media in recent weeks, particularly since Donald Trump accused Volodymyr Zelensky of being ungrateful for US military support," Madeline Roache, managing editor at misinformation watchdog NewsGuard, told DW.

"We've seen an avalanche of different disinformation campaigns, influence campaigns, different means trying to portray President Zelenskyy personally as a bad leader, the person that should resign, the person that made everything wrong and that Ukraine is bad, corrupt and should stop the war. And that Ukraine wants to prolong the war rather than stop it," Roman Osadchuk, an open source and disinformation researcher at the National University of Kyiv, told DW.

Many of these claims [align with pro-Russian propaganda narratives](/en/fact-check-russian-fake-news-targets-ukraines-zelenskyy/a-68346906)
 about the [war in Ukraine](/en/russias-war-in-ukraine/t-60931789)
, often depicting Zelenskyy as corrupt and profiting from the conflict. A January 2025 [US Department of State fact sheet](https://archive.ph/FGy87 "External link — US Department of State fact sheet")
 on US military aid to Ukraine stated that SOF received a total of $42 million, which was allocated for training and other services to develop SOF and Ukraine's National Guard, conventional forces, non-commissioned officer corps, and combat medical care since 2014.

Did Ukraine stage war scenes to get more money from the US?
-----------------------------------------------------------

**Claim:** "Ukraine 'soldiers' have resorted to faking combat in order to appear 'war torn' so the slush fund from the US keeps churning money their way!"  [claimed](https://archive.ph/Mhho8 "External link — claimed")
an X user, posting a video showing a woman in combat uniform receiving professional makeup and asking in Ukrainian whether she should tighten her helmet.

The post went viral, garnering 8.1 million views. Instead, it was filmed during the production of the music video for the song "Brothers" by Ukrainian artists Misha Skorpion and Vitsyk. 

The old narrative of Ukraine staging Russia's war has resurfaced in a new claimImage: x/DW

The video, displaying the username "@vitsikkk2", was initially [posted](https://www.tiktok.com/@vitsikkkk2/video/7476000137416871174 "External link — posted")
on the TikTok account of the artist Vitsyk, who is also a paramedic serving in the Ukrainian army. She can be clearly identified in [the music video](https://youtu.be/NwzqTYEpk8Y?si=Uyu1mIpeFu_5vF7R&t=101 "External link — the music video")
, which appeared on YouTube just a week before this article was published.

Similar claims have been common in past Russian propaganda, often accusing Ukraine of faking atrocities. From February 18 to February 24, 2025, NewsGuard identified about 27,600 social media posts and articles mentioning "Zelenskyy" alongside terms like "villa," "yacht," "winery," or "mansion" — a 2,524% increase from the previous six-day period, which saw just 1,050 such mentions.

[DW Fact check](/en/fact-check/t-56584214)
 investigated some of the viral claims.

Did Zelenskyy swear at Trump on camera in London? 
--------------------------------------------------

**Claim:** "Zelensky burning a very big bridge," [claimed](https://archive.ph/F7L06 "External link — claimed")
an X user in a post that garnered 4 million views. The post features a video allegedly showing Zelenskyy swearing at Trump while arriving to meet UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, the day after their argument in the Oval Office."

On December 2, anonymous Russian-language accounts on Facebook and Instagram ([1](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=541571908871528&set=a.101819279513462)
, [2](https://www.instagram.com/vizovvremenivv/p/DDE_2QJt2iJ/)
) spread information claiming that Volodymyr Zelensky purchased a hotel in Courchevel, France, for 88 million. Reports about the hotel sale have been spread by a questionable French-language media outlet, registered on November 25 of this year, while the link, which according to the report leads to the hotel’s website, is fraudulent and was created on November 22.**

Several fact-checking organizations ( [Dpa](https://dpa-factchecking.com/belgium/241203-99-214531/?fbclid=IwY2xjawG88MtleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHbkKjc7q2HviTLlnsH5KzjC2JQPi3w2sNcgRkQEHVvvYgS8-qSYNs4frmw_aem_cnqG1ln1AEcVYLnwDOBbxQ)

) have published articles on this topic. Therefore, the newly registered site under the same name is fraudulent.

[![morigi dezinphormatsia thithqos volodimir zelenskim dzviradghirebuli sastumro sheidzina3 | mythdetector.com](https://mythdetector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/morigi-dezinphormatsia-thithqos-volodimir-zelenskim-dzviradghirebuli-sastumro-sheidzina3.png "morigi dezinphormatsia thithqos volodimir zelenskim dzviradghirebuli sastumro sheidzina3 | mythdetector.com")](https://mythdetector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/morigi-dezinphormatsia-thithqos-volodimir-zelenskim-dzviradghirebuli-sastumro-sheidzina3.png)

The archived version of the fake website states that the hotel is owned by Film Heritage Inc., an offshore company that was reportedly managed by Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his wife, Olena Zelenska, until 2019. This fact has been reported by [various media outlets](https://lobservateurdemonaco.com/enquetes/hotel-de-luxe-courchevel-sbm/)
, but nowhere does it state that the hotel was resold and purchased by the Zelenskyy family.

It is worth noting that the claim that the Zelenskyy family spends Western money on personal luxuries has long been circulating and used as a Russian method to discredit Zelenskyy. *   [About Us](https://mythdetector.com/en/about-us/)

**The information claiming that Volodymyr Zelenskyy purchased an expensive villa in France is false. [Ukraine’s Center for Countering Disinformation](https://t.me/CenterCounteringDisinformation/12442)
 has also addressed the issue.

The claim about Zelensky purchasing a villa in France appeared on a French-language website, [Les Echos de la France](https://lesechosdelafrance.fr/la-societe-de-zelensky-a-achete-un-hotel-dans-la-station-de-ski-de-courchevel/)
, which presents itself as a media outlet, on November 28. However, using relevant keywords to search online, we found no such information in any reputable media sources.

The [Les Echos de la France](https://lesechosdelafrance.fr/la-societe-de-zelensky-a-achete-un-hotel-dans-la-station-de-ski-de-courchevel/)
 article includes a hyperlink to the hotel’s website, which is currently [inaccessible](https://hotelpalacedesneiges.com/)
. However, the official website of [Palace des Neiges](https://www.montecarlosbm.com/en/hotel-courchevel/monte-carlo-one-courchevel)

Propagandists fabricated a video purportedly produced by an American TV channel and created a cloned hotel website

Russian propaganda continues to fabricate stories targeting Western audiences, alleging illicit enrichment of senior Ukrainian officials and their families. <image:5669>

Secondly, for this fake, Russian propaganda created a [cloned website](https://archive.is/d0hf5)
 for the Palace des Neiges hotel, falsely claiming that it was owned by Film Heritage Inc. This fictional company, allegedly based in Basel, Switzerland, was previously linked by propagandists to Zelensky's "property" in a fabricated story about him purchasing the [Vuni Palace casino](https://www.newsweek.com/fact-check-did-volodymyr-zelensky-buy-cyprus-casino-1909176)
, the largest in Europe. <image:5671>

It is worth noting that the [original website](https://www.palacedesneiges.com/)
, unlike the fabricated version, does not include any information about the hotel's ownership. Although the fake website is [no longer active](https://www.hotelpalacedesneiges.com/)

Content: "And speaking of which, why is Elon Musk in the Oval Office wearing a baseball hat and a T-shirt all the time?"

In an interview with French newspaper Le Figaro earlier on Monday, Nate Vance said his cousin was a "good guy, intelligent" but that the meeting with Zelensky was "an ambush of absolute bad faith".

He later told the PM programme that he had been a "Republican my whole life so this is an odd stance for me to be taking but I'm pretty passionate about it and it's one issue where I think we're doing wrong".

He said it was unlikely his cousin would want to speak to him following his comments.

Asked about other Americans' view of the encounter, he said 20% would be "disheartened" and that "all of this alienation is isolating us and the last time we decided to take an isolationist path we ended up with World War One and World War Two".

Zelensky subsequently said the angry exchange had been "regrettable" and it was "time to make things right".

The US is attempting to mediate with both Russia and Ukraine in hopes of ending the war.

Last week, Trump said that he was ["doing very well with Russia" and that it was "more difficult, frankly, to deal with Ukraine"](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/crknjxj3n4zo)

Vice-President JD Vance said President Zelensky should be more grateful for US support during the heated White House exchange

US Vice-President JD Vance's cousin has criticised him and President Donald Trump for "belittling" Volodymyr Zelensky during the three men's Oval Office showdown in February.

"There's a certain level of decorum that I expect from political leaders, especially in front of cameras," Nate Vance - who spent three years volunteering with the Ukrainian military after Russia's full-scale invasion - told the BBC.

It follows his earlier comment that Trump and Vance were acting like "useful idiots" for President Vladimir Putin in their handling of the conflict.

Last month US and Russian officials held direct talks on ending the war. US and Ukrainian officials are currently in Saudi Arabia for talks.

Nate Vance told the BBC's PM programme on Monday that he was "not happy" with the way in which the White House meeting had been handled by his cousin and Trump.

"I'm kind of attached to the Ukrainian issue but, looking at that, if it were some other completely neutral issue and I saw White House officials and hack journalists that are political belittling a foreign leader, I'd be like 'what the hell is going on?'" he told the BBC.

The [televised Oval Office meeting](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/c625ex282zzt)
 between the leaders quickly turned heated, with Trump threatening to withdraw support from Ukraine if a deal was not made and accusing the Ukrainian President of "gambling with World War Three".

[Vance called Zelensky "disrespectful" for "litigating" the dispute in front of the media](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c9dejydynngo)
 and accused him of not expressing gratitude for America's support during the war.

Nate Vance said that he did not agree that Zelensky had failed to show appreciation.

JD Vance's cousin criticises him for 'belittling' Zelensky

! "Zelensky does a daily or nightly address and thanks everyone who supports Ukraine on a daily basis," he said.

He said that perhaps the Ukrainian leader had not shown "enough deference to Donald Trump" but that it would be "odd for my cousin and Donald Trump to ask for deference because they've been actively working against his initiatives for the past three years".

Zelensky was eventually asked to leave the White House and a planned news conference was cancelled.

Following the meeting, the Trump administration [halted military aid](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce8yz5dk82wo)

 to Kyiv.

[Vance took the lead attacking Zelensky. Since the start of the war, Zelensky has eschewed suits for military-style dress in what he says is solidarity with soldiers.

"Everyone knows that's why he does that and it's kind of a symbolic thing," Nate Vance said."

Pandora Papers reporting
------------------------

In 2021, following the release of the [Pandora Papers](https://www.icij.org/investigations/pandora-papers/global-investigation-tax-havens-offshore/)
, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, a global network of investigative journalists, [reported](https://www.occrp.org/en/project/the-pandora-papers/pandora-papers-reveal-offshore-holdings-of-ukrainian-president-and-his-inner-circle)
 that Zelenskyy and several business partners had owned a "network of offshore companies."

Zelenskyy largely removed himself from the network in connection with becoming president in 2019, according to the [report](https://www.occrp.org/en/project/the-pandora-papers/pandora-papers-reveal-offshore-holdings-of-ukrainian-president-and-his-inner-circle#:~:text=The%20documents%20also%20show%20that%20just,that%20now%20belongs%20to%20his%20wife.)
, gifting shares in offshore companies to his wife or business partners.

It was unclear from the report how much money was held in the offshore companies.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the President of Ukraine, faced criticism from Donald Trump and JD Vance during a tense White House meeting. While Brian Glenn, Chief White House Correspondent at Real America’s Voice, donning a blue suit himself, tried to ‘embarrass’ Zelenskyy by asking him whether he owned a suit or not, the Ukranian president gave it back to him by saying, "I will wear a (suit) costume after this war finishes, yes. 

Who is Volodymyr Zelenskyy? 

------------------------------

  
Volodymyr Oleksandrovych Zelenskyy is a Ukrainian politician and former entertainer who has served as the sixth and current president of Ukraine since 2019, most notably during the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, which has been ongoing since February 2022. 
As per Forbes’ estimate, Zelensky’s entire real estate portfolio is worth $4 million, including two more wholly owned apartments, two that he co-owned, a single commercial property, and five parking spaces. 'Fight On Your Own...'

  
Meanwhile, on Monday, President Donald Trump ordered a 'pause' on US military aid to Ukraine after a tense Oval Office meeting, aiming to push Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy into peace negotiations with Russia. Zelenskyy, known for his calm demeanor despite the confrontation, ultimately left without securing a crucial minerals deal. The Ukrainian president was at the White House for a meeting with US President [Donald Trump](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/donald-trump)
, which ended in an ‘unprecedented disaster’ after Trump, along with his VP, JD Vance, engaged in a ‘shouting match’ all the while ‘berating’ Zelenskyy. 
First, it was about Zelenskyy’s outfit (he wore a black sweater – the same color and cut he has donned every time he’s appeared in droopy military fatigues) that was questioned by an American reporter."

[The Pandora Papers](https://www.occrp.org/en/project/the-pandora-papers)

Investigation

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky rode to power on pledges to clean up the Eastern European country, but the Pandora Papers reveal he and his close circle were the beneficiaries of a network of offshore companies, including some that owned expensive London property.

Key Findings

*   Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his partners in comedy production owned a network of offshore companies related to their business based in the British Virgin Islands, Cyprus, and Belize.
*   Zelensky’s current chief aide, Serhiy Shefir, as well as the head of the country’s Security Service, were part of the offshore network.
*   Offshore companies were used by Shefir and another business partner to buy pricey London real estate.
*   Around the time of his 2019 election, Zelensky handed his shares in a key offshore company over to Shefir, but the two appear to have made an arrangement for Zelensky’s family to continue receiving money from the offshore.

Leaked documents from the Pandora Papers reveal that Sri Lankan-Irish businessman Anura Perera, named by the Kenyan Anti-Corruption Commission as a suspect in the Anglo Leasing procurement scandal, was the owner, director or signatory of at least six offshore firms implicated in the case. In general offshore companies are bad, whether they’re owned by a president or not,” Ryaboshapka said.

He called moving money offshore “an old tradition” in Ukraine, because the country was perceived as a dangerous place with “no rule of law.” But still, the use of such companies today raises red flags of “tax evasion or the legalization of dirty money,” he said.

“That’s the essence of offshore companies.”

Actor Volodymyr Zelensky stormed to the Ukrainian presidency in 2019 on a wave of public anger against the country’s political class, including previous leaders who used secret companies to stash their wealth overseas.

Now, leaked documents prove that Zelensky and his inner circle have had their own network of offshore companies. The show starred Zelensky as a humble history teacher whose anti-corruption rant in class is filmed by a student, goes viral online, and wins him national office.

In a case of life imitating art, Zelensky ended up winning the real-world Ukrainian presidency just three-and-a-half years after the show’s launch, with more than 73 percent of the vote.

Zelensky capitalized on widespread public anger at corruption, but his 2019 campaign was dogged by doubts over his anti-graft bona fides, given that his campaign was boosted by media belonging to Kolomoisky — who is [accused of stealing US$5.5 billion](https://www.occrp.org/en/investigations/oligarchs-weaponized-cyprus-eranch-of-ukraines-largest-bank-to-send-5-billion-abroad)
 from his own bank and funneling it offshore in concert with his partner, Hennadiy Boholiubov.

In the heat of the campaign, a political ally of incumbent President Petro Poroshenko published a chart on Facebook purporting to show that Zelensky and his television production partners were beneficiaries of a web of offshore firms that allegedly received $41 million in funds from Kolomoisky’s Privatbank.

That ally, Volodymyr Ariev, didn’t provide evidence, and his accusations have never been proven. But the Pandora Papers show that at least some of the details in this alleged scheme correspond to reality. / Alamy Stock Photo\

Serhiy Shefir (right) and Volodymyr Zelensky (left) at Zelensky’s presidential campaign headquarters in 2019.

Serhiy Shefir’s brother Borys, who is a part-owner of Maltex Multicapital Corp, said he may indeed be an owner, but was unaware of the details of the offshore arrangement, which was largely the work of Ukraine’s now-Security Service chief, Bakanov.

“Bakanov was our financial director, he set up the financial schemes of our company. Zelensky has not mentioned Maltex in any of his public asset declarations, including one filed for 2018, when he still owned 25 percent of the company.

In such an arrangement, “the real owner has placed another person to act as his or her proxy to pretend to be the shareholder,” Woods said.

“The person making the transfer wants to retain the shares and the benefit of the shares, but doesn’t want other people to know that that is the situation."

In response to questions sent by Pandora Papers reporters, Fidelity confirmed it was the registered agent for Maltex Multicapital Corp, but it said that Zelensky was not currently an owner or beneficiary of any company under its administration.

“The present Ukrainian president is not our client, nor does he have any ownership or any other position in any entity under our administration,” Fidelity said.

The company also argued that there would have been nothing wrong to have worked for Zelensky prior to his ascent to political office in 2019. The chart showed money flowing from the bank via a series of apparent shell entities to companies alleged to have been owned by Zelensky and associates.

Ariev has not provided documentation to back up his claims.

However, the Pandora Papers documents do provide the first corroboration for elements of his allegation: that 10 of the companies that allegedly received the money really did belong to Zelensky and his partners. The financial flows that are visible from the documents appear to be connected to their television production business, of which Kolomoisky was a client.

The leaked documents show the offshore network was set up by individuals behind Kvartal 95 in 2012, the same year in which local media reported that Kvartal 95 entered into a production deal with Kolomoisky’s 1+1 Group.

The Pandora Papers show that SVT Films Ltd, a company that was as of May 2013 half-owned by the BVI holding company Maltex, was to be paid $1.2 million in licensing fees by January 2013 by an offshore company linked to Kolomoisky’s 1+1 network for the television program “Make a Comedian Laugh.”

In 2015, a company called Gimentiano Holdings Ltd, which was ultimately owned by Zelensky’s friend Andriy Iakovlev, also received $750,000 into its account at the Cyprus branch of Kolomoisky’s Privatbank."

# Your Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The OCCRP published an article on October 3, 2021, revealing that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his inner circle were beneficiaries of a network of offshore companies. The Pandora Papers show that Zelensky and his partners in comedy production owned a network of offshore companies related to their business based in the British Virgin Islands, Cyprus, and Belize. Zelensky handed his shares in a key offshore company over to Serhiy Shefir around the time of his 2019 election, but the two appear to have made an arrangement for Zelensky’s family to continue receiving money from the offshore. <image:k>

On February 20, during the broadcast of “New Paradigm,” host Tengo Omanadze spoke about the increase in President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s wealth during the Russia-Ukraine war \[[52:40](https://www.facebook.com/100064835944683/videos/1031699295465330)\
\]. According to Zelenskyy’s financial declarations, his income decreased after the war began, and his family’s financial situation was affected by the temporary suspension of rental income from real estate. Moreover, according to Forbes and Bloomberg, Ivanishvili’s wealth has increased compared to the beginning of the war.**

*   #### **Did Zelenskyy’s Income Increase or Decrease After the War Began?**
    

Before entering politics, Volodymyr Zelenskyy was a successful actor and producer, accumulating his wealth while working in the entertainment industry before becoming president. Thus, the increase in Zelenskyy’s family income compared to the previous year was linked to the resumption of rental payments.

Regarding savings, financial declarations show that the family’s cash reserves have gradually decreased. By the end of 2022, their savings had dropped by approximately 1.8 million hryvnias, and by the end of 2023, they had [decreased](https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-publishes-declaration-unveiling-more-than-317-000-of-income-for-his-family-in-2023/)
 by another 2.8 million hryvnias (about $71,000).

It is notable that Zelenskyy’s financial situation has not changed significantly since becoming president. According to the latest available Forbes data from 2022, his net worth is [less](https://www.logicallyfacts.com/en/fact-check/false-ukraine-president-volodymyr-zelenskyy-s-net-worth-is-over-500-million?u)
 than $30 million. While this is a substantial amount, it is not surprising in the case of Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as he was a successful actor and producer.

The real estate owned by Zelenskyy and his family has remained practically unchanged during his presidency. Myth Detector has published multiple reports debunking such claims:

*   #### **How Did Ivanishvili’s Wealth Change During the Russia-Ukraine War?**
    

[According](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/profiles/bidzina-ivanishvili/)
 to Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index, Bidzina Ivanishvili’s wealth is estimated at $7.60 billion \[March 5, 2025\], ranking him 406th on the list."

“I need ammunition, not a ride,” he famously said.

As the war in Ukraine rages on, rumors abound online regarding Zelenskyy’s net worth, including assets such as homes and vehicles. The site says that the president’s financial disclosure from 2018 listed total assets worth 37 million hryvnias, Ukrainian currency. He graduated from Kryvyi Rih Institute of Economics with a law degree, but never practiced, according to ClutchPoints.

Thanks for signing up.

Thank you for signing up. Some news sources speculate that tweets declaring the former comedian’s net worth at $1.5 billion were efforts to undermine support for Zelenskyy and Ukraine.

### So how much is Zelenskyy really worth?

According to Celebrity Net Worth, Zelenskyy is worth roughly $1.5 million — not $1.5 billion. At the time, that gave him a net worth of $1.5 million USD, although, due to foreign exchange rates, the amount fluctuates.

Zelenskyy earned most of his money as a Ukrainian entertainer, starring in Russian-language films including “Love in the Big City,” “Office Romance,” and “8 First Dates.” The tri-lingual president, who is fluent in Russian, Ukrainian, and English, also dubbed the Ukrainian voiceovers for “Paddington”and “Paddington 2.”

From 2015 to 2019, he starred in a political satire comedy series, “Servant of the People.” The oddly prophetic show, which aired for 51 episodes, chronicled the adventures of a high school teacher turned president of Ukraine. In 2019, Zelenskyy ran for office and was elected as president.

Although this marked Zelenskyy’s first foray into politics, he does have the education to back up his recent career change."

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Myth Detector article discusses claims about Volodymyr Zelenskyy's wealth, stating that his income decreased after the war began and that his family's financial situation was affected by the temporary suspension of rental income from real estate. It also mentions that Forbes estimates Zelenskyy's net worth to be less than $30 million and includes links to reports debunking claims about his real estate holdings. The article was published on March 6, 2025. <image:1930>

An AOL article from April 24, 2022, states that Zelenskyy's 2018 financial disclosure listed total assets worth 37 million hryvnias. According to Celebrity Net Worth, Zelenskyy is worth roughly $1.5 million, not $1.5 billion, and his monthly income is $930. <image:1936>

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is demonstrably false. Multiple sources, including Snopes ([https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-facts-behind-resurfaced-231800640.html](https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-facts-behind-resurfaced-231800640.html)), debunk the assertion that Zelenskyy owns 15 homes, a home in Florida, private planes, and has a monthly income of $11 million.

Evidence indicates Zelenskyy declared fewer than 15 properties, none in the U.S., and no planes. His overseas bank account holds approximately $377,000, and his annual income is around $300,000, which is about $25,000 per month. Other sources state his real estate portfolio is worth $4 million and that his net worth is roughly $1.5 million, with a monthly income of $930.

Furthermore, the evidence suggests that Zelenskyy's financial situation has been affected by the war, with a decrease in income and the temporary suspension of rental income from real estate.

WATCH: Harris meets with Ukraine’s Zelenskyy as Russia makes nuclear warning
============================================================================

[World](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world)
 Sep 26, 2024 6:51 PM EDT

WASHINGTON (AP) — With American support for Ukraine at a partisan crossroads, Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday slammed suggestions that Kyiv should cede territory for the sake of peace with Moscow as “dangerous and unacceptable.”

The Democratic presidential nominee spoke alongside Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as she unleashed the veiled criticism of Republican candidate Donald Trump’s push for Ukraine to quickly cut a deal to end the war.

**Watch Harris and Zelenskyy’s remarks in the player above.**

“They are not proposals for peace,” Harris said. “Where Trump goes off course, and where Biden and Harris have a much stronger argument, is that we get to that point not by throwing Ukraine under the bus but by giving them sufficient support so they can block further Russian aggression.”

_Associated Press writers Aamer Madhani and Michelle Price in New York and Ellen Knickmeyer, Lisa Mascaro, Mary Clare Jalonick, Kevin Freking, Steven Groves and Amelia Thomson-Deveaux in Washington contributed to this report._

 [Chris Megerian, Associated Press](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/author/chris-megerian-associated-press) assistance for Ukraine, praised Russian President Vladimir Putin and faulted Zelenskyy for the ongoing bloodshed.

[**WATCH:** Trump suggests Ukraine should have made concessions to Putin before Russian invasion during N.C. He rejected Harris’ criticisms and insisted that he only wants to stop the “horror show that’s gone on.”

Asked if Ukraine should give up territory, Trump said “we’ll see what happens” and “we need peace.”

Before announcing the meeting with Zelenskyy, Trump posted on social media a purported message from the Ukrainian leader asking to see him. The message, which was not confirmed by Ukrainian officials, said “we have to strive to understand each other.”

The decision to publicly disclose what appeared to be private communications, however benign their contents, was a reminder of the tension that’s been brewing between Trump and Zelenskyy.

It was a far different impression than Harris delivered on Thursday as she embraced Ukraine’s defense and outlined a broader foreign policy vision rooted in “international order, rules and norms.” Harris rejected calls for the U.S. to walk away from its global role and warned that potential aggressors could be emboldened if Putin emerges victorious.

“The United States supports Ukraine not out of charity, but because it’s in our strategic interest,” Harris said.

Zelenskyy was in Washington to present the White House and Congress with his plans for reaching an endgame in the war by improving Ukraine’s chances on the battlefield and its eventual leverage at the negotiating table. has a responsibility to help Ukraine, compared with one third of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, according to a Pew Research Center poll conducted in July.

Americans are also split on which presidential candidate would do a better job handling the war. [An AP-NORC poll from August](https://apnorc.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AP-NORC-August-2024-President-Topline.pdf)
 found that about one-third of Americans said they trusted Harris more, while a similar share said the same about Trump.

On Thursday, Zelenskyy found some bipartisan support as he visited Capitol Hill, where he was greeted by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.

Sen. Jim Himes, another Connecticut Democrat and the ranking member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said Zelenskyy wanted “more, faster.”

“He was politely frustrated,” Himes said, and specifically requested more Patriot missile defenses as Russia escalates strikes on Ukraine’s cities and energy grid before the winter.

Zelenskyy faces a much more tense situation with Trump. However, he said, Trump risks undermining Ukraine by enabling Putin to make more gains on the battlefield.

“Neither Ukraine nor Russia is going to win this war, and the sooner that the parties try to end this, the better,” Kupchan said. He’s pushing to lift restrictions on using long-range Western weapons to strike targets deeper in Russian territory.

No movement on this issue was evident during Zelenskyy’s visit."

His plan is similar to that of Putin, who also calls for Ukraine to cede the territory now occupied by Russia and agree never to join NATO.

**What would a Harris administration do on Russia and Ukraine?**
----------------------------------------------------------------

Harris, who has been associated with the Biden administration’s policies, [promised](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/watch-kamala-harris-full-speech-at-the-2024-dnc)
 at the Democratic convention in August that she “will stand strong with Ukraine and our NATO allies.”

Harris first met with Zelenskyy at the Munich Security Conference in 2022 a few days before the Russian invasion, warning the Ukrainian leader of the Kremlin’s impending attack and sharing American intelligence that suggested the invasion was imminent as Russian troops were poised to invade.

Ukraine and its war with Russia have become a central and controversial topic in the 2024 U.S. During the presidential debate with Harris in September, Trump declined to reveal whether he wanted Ukraine to win its war with Russia when he was asked, instead responding, “I want the war to stop,” and urging the two countries to negotiate a deal.

“What I’ll do is I’ll speak to one, I’ll speak to the other, I’ll get them together,” Trump [said](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/harris-trump-russia-ukraine-2024/)
. Trump and Zelenskyy had a phone call in July, which the former president described as a “very good phone call.” He [wrote](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-he-had-very-good-call-with-ukraines-zelenskiy-friday-2024-07-19/)
 in a social media post after that call that when he is president, Ukraine and Russia “will be able to come together and negotiate a deal that ends the violence and paves a path forward to prosperity.” He has suggested that lifting the sanctions against Russia will be part of this deal.

Trump has criticized the Biden administration for sending billions of dollars in aid to Ukraine. A Harris administration might well continue Biden’s policy of providing Ukraine with enough support so that it does not lose, but not with the wherewithal to win and eject Russia from Ukrainian territory.

**What is the outlook?**
------------------------

On the face of it, it appears that a future Harris administration’s policy toward Russia and Ukraine would represent continuity with that of the Biden administration. The brutal conflict, in which a [million people](https://www.wsj.com/world/one-million-are-now-dead-or-injured-in-the-russia-ukraine-war-b09d04e5)
 have been killed or severely injured, shows no signs of ending. President Joe Biden has said that [Ukraine must prevail](https://www.reuters.com/world/biden-says-putin-will-not-prevail-war-with-ukraine-2024-09-13/)
 in this war and that Russia will not win. Donald Trump, who claims the war would not have broken out had he been president in 2022, says he [could end it 24 hours](https://apnews.com/article/trump-russia-ukraine-war-un-election-a78ecb843af452b8dda1d52d137ca893)
 after being elected, before his inauguration.

The issue for the American voter is whether the United States should continue to support Ukraine for as long as it takes (as the White House now says) or whether it should pressure Ukraine to negotiate with Russia and end the war without having regained its full territorial integrity. national interest to pour so much money into supporting Ukraine and favor a rapid end to the conflict.

**Trump’s policies toward Russia and Ukraine during his presidency**

Both Russia and Ukraine featured prominently during Trump’s first presidency, as I have [written](https://cup.columbia.edu/book/chaos-reconsidered/9780231556262)
 elsewhere."

2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

**Rumor – Vladimir Putin allegedly demanded the extradition of Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci for crimes related to the pandemic as a condition to end the conflict in Ukraine.**

Analysis

Denialist and conspiratorial content involving public figures such as Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci continues to circulate on conspiracy websites.

These publications often reinforce theories of the so-called “new world order,” deny the severity of the Covid-19 pandemic, and portray authoritarian leaders as “saviors” in a battle against global elites. Another example is the false claim that [he was arrested for child trafficking](https://www.boatos.org/mundo/bill-gates-preso-exercito-americano-trafico-de-criancas-outros-crimes.html)
, which was also completely fabricated.

Conclusion

It is false that Vladimir Putin demanded the extradition of Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci as a condition to end the war with Ukraine. Given this, let’s answer the following questions: 1) Did Putin request the extradition of Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci to end the war in Ukraine? 3) Are Gates and Fauci facing any legal actions in Russia?

Did Putin request the extradition of Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci to end the war in Ukraine?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

No. A post claims that Putin demanded the extradition of Bill Gates and Fauci to be tried in Russia for bioterrorism and crimes against humanity.

According to the story, this would be the condition imposed by the Russian president to end the war in Ukraine. There is no official record — whether from the Russian government, credible media, or diplomatic sources — that Vladimir Putin ever made any extradition request involving Bill Gates or Anthony Fauci. These demands have been detailed in reports by [Veja](https://veja.abril.com.br/mundo/as-condicoes-que-putin-pode-impor-ao-acordo-de-cessar-fogo-com-ucrania/)
, [G1](https://g1.globo.com/jornal-nacional/noticia/2025/03/13/vladimir-putin-condiciona-cessar-fogo-com-a-ucrania-a-uma-serie-de-exigencias-como-manter-definitivamente-territorios-que-invadiu.ghtml)

"In one of the shots, the model is only wearing her underwear, lying on a blue carpet with the United States seal, as though the editors of the men's magazine knew something in advance about the future of their model," he added with a smirk.

Beside him, Skabeeva can be seen visibly trying to suppress laughter.

Since Russian President Vladimir Putin suppressed freedom of speech in the country in the early 2000s and placed a tight grip on all mainstream TV networks, with little has been allowed to be aired in Russia without the government's permission.

His criticism stems from a September 2024 visit to a munitions plant in Scranton, Pennsylvania, a battleground state that narrowly backed Trump in November.

"I began my visit to the United States by expressing my gratitude to all the employees at the plant and by reaching agreements to expand cooperation between Pennsylvania and our Zaporizhzhia," Zelensky wrote in a post to X at the time.

By [Alex Seitz-Wald](https://www.nbcnews.com/author/alex-seitz-wald-ncpn385646)

Vice President Kamala Harris is meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a trip to the U.S., while former President Donald Trump isn’t, highlighting the growing partisan division over a key foreign policy issue.

Harris is scheduled to meet Thursday with Zelenskyy at the White House. Democratic criticism of Trump's position on Ukraine has frequently nodded to years of suggestions that he was indebted to Putin and unwilling to cross him.

“That’s not who we are as Americans,” she said before she invoked, in a nod to the electoral stakes, the votes of 800,000 Polish Americans in Pennsylvania, a number roughly 10 times the margin by which Biden won in 2020 and 20 times Trump’s margin of victory in 2016. 

Poland is one of Russia’s strongest opponents, and pro-Harris forces have [run ads](https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-polish-american-voters-trump-4a0bb4126ab2ded70cf78bb76501d7d9)
 specifically targeting Polish Americans. NBC News had reported that Trump and Polish President Andrzej Duda were to visit a Catholic shrine together last Sunday, but the trip was scrapped for logistical reasons, according to a campaign source familiar with the planning. 

But Harris hasn’t detailed many specifics about how she would oversee the war effort as president, especially if Republicans in Congress lose appetite for approving more funds for the country.

Some outside the administration argue that despite the heated rhetoric of the campaign, Harris might also look for ways to help wind down the war amid the stark political realities a future Harris administration would face.

“I think they recognize that having a war without end on NATO’s eastern flank is not in the enduring interests of the alliance or, frankly, the American interest, either,” said Smith, of Stand Together.

Sept. Since the possibility of Trump’s returning to power became more realistic, Zelenskyy has [appeared to tread carefully](https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/10/europe/ukraine-volodymyr-zelensky-delphi-economic-forum-intl/index.html)
 at times when he discusses Trump or responds to his criticism.

Ukraine has mostly enjoyed bipartisan support in Congress since Russia invaded it in 2022. support, it might be difficult for Ukraine to keep up the fight against Russia.

The partisan divide appeared to grow this week after Zelenskyy visited a munitions factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Biden's hometown, which Trump and other Republicans viewed as a signal of which way he wants the November election to go. 

Republicans also took issue with recent comments Zelenskyy made to [The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-new-yorker-interview/volodymyr-zelensky-has-a-plan-for-ukraines-victory)
 in which he called Trump’s running mate, Sen. over the Pennsylvania trip.

“The facility was in a politically contested battleground state, was led by a top political surrogate for Kamala Harris, and failed to include a single Republican because — on purpose — no Republicans were invited,” Johnson wrote. We cannot look away, and we will not let up on our support for Ukraine,” he said. 

Harris has echoed that message, [telling Zelenskyy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/02/17/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-and-president-zelenskyy-of-ukraine-in-joint-press-conference-munich-germany/)
 in February that “we will be with you for as long as it takes.”

Trump has a long history of praising Putin, and he has vowed to end the war on his first day back in the White House, though he has refused to say how or whether he wants Kyiv to win. 

“I want the war to stop,” Trump when he was pressed during his only debate with Harris. 26, 2024, 5:00 AM EDT / Updated Sept. Trump won't meet with him while he's in the country this week for the United Nations General Assembly, and he has grown increasingly critical of Zelenskyy, accusing him of having a favorite in the coming election.

“The president of Ukraine is in our country, and he’s making little nasty aspersions toward your favorite president, me,” Trump said Wednesday in North Carolina. Any deal, even the worst deal, would have been better than what we have right now.”

Zelenskyy had implied that he was going to meet with Trump this week, but Trump's campaign said there had been no formal agreement for a meeting.

Trump has been saying for months, and he has repeated more frequently at rallies this week, that he would immediately end the war in Ukraine — even if it was on terms favorable to Moscow — and he dismissed Zelenskyy as a “great salesman” for securing money for his country who “so badly” wants Democrats to win to keep the money flowing.

“Every time Zelenskyy comes to the United States, he walks away with $100 billion,” Trump said Tuesday in Georgia."

She took aim at those who've floated Ukraine ceding territory to Russia.

By[Alexandra Hutzler](https://abcnews.go.com/author/alexandra_hutzler)

September 26, 2024, 6:13 PM

Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday pledged to continue support to Ukraine as she met with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to discuss his so-called "victory plan" to bring an end to war with Russia.

Harris cast the conflict as a fight for fundamental principles of "freedom and independence."

"We also know that other would-be aggressors around the world are watching to see what happens in Ukraine," Harris said. Instead, they are proposals for surrender, which is dangerous and unacceptable," she added.

"I believe I will be able to make a deal between President Putin and President Zelenskyy quite quickly," Trump said. We need to stop the death and destruction."

Zelenskyy has called Vance "too radical," taking issue with his [statements](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/09/12/vance-trump-ukraine-russia-war-plan/)
 that a Trump-Vance administration's approach to the war would likely include Ukraine ceding territory to Russia and the current line of demarcation becoming a demilitarized zone. Johnson told reporters he would not be in town, but if he had sat down with Zelenskyy, would have aired grievances about his tour of an American munitions manufacturing plant in Pennsylvania.

Zelenskyy made the case to lawmakers for permission to strike deeper into Russia at military targets using U.S.-supplied weapons. Several senators on both sides of the aisle expressed a desire for Biden to give Zelenskyy authorization to do so.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that JD Vance accused Volodymyr Zelenskyy of campaigning for Kamala Harris. News reports mention Zelenskyy's visit to a munitions plant in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and meetings with U.S. lawmakers. Some Republicans viewed the visit as a signal of his preference in the election. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Zelenskyy campaigned for Harris.

The claim is partially supported by the evidence, as Zelenskyy's actions were perceived by some as potentially favoring Harris. However, the evidence does not confirm direct campaigning.

To fully verify the claim, information is missing regarding the specifics of Zelenskyy's actions during his visit to Pennsylvania and his meetings with U.S. lawmakers. Specifically, what did he say or do that could be interpreted as campaigning for Harris?

**Did Zelenskyy Campaign For Harris?**

Zelenskyy visited the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant in Scranton, Pennsylvania in September last year. Truth Behind Trump's Claim
====================================================================================

Authored by: [Aradhana Brahma](https://www.timesnownews.com/author/aradhana-brahma-479267048)

Updated Mar 1, 2025, 01:50 IST

President Donald Trump, during his meeting at the Oval Office on Friday, accused Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy, of being disrespectful towards the United States. No Republicans were invited to the event.

During the visit, Zelenskyy thanked the workers and emphasized the importance of US support, but he did not explicitly endorse Harris or any candidate by name in public statements tied to the visit itself.

**The Oval Office Meeting**

The meeting on Friday, which was supposed to be a civil conversation on the crisis in Ukraine and US backing, devolved into a tirade between Vice President JD Vance and Ukrainian President Trump. The Ukrainian president was then joined by Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, a prominent Democrat, as well as Senator Bob Casey. Reporters inside the Oval Office stated that Trump and Vance said the Ukrainian president has not been "thankful" enough and accused him of "gambling with World War Three."

After the furious dispute at the White House, President Trump said on Truth Social that Zelenskyy "is not ready for peace."

The White House canceled the joint press conference with Ukraine following the presidents' arguments."

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that JD Vance accused Volodymyr Zelenskyy of campaigning for Kamala Harris. News reports mention Zelenskyy's visit to a munitions plant in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and meetings with U.S. lawmakers. Some Republicans viewed the visit as a signal of his preference in the election. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Zelenskyy campaigned for Harris.

The claim is partially supported by the evidence, as Zelenskyy's actions were perceived by some as potentially favoring Harris. However, the evidence does not confirm direct campaigning.

To fully verify the claim, information is missing regarding the specifics of Zelenskyy's actions during his visit to Pennsylvania and his meetings with U.S. lawmakers. Specifically, what did he say or do that could be interpreted as campaigning for Harris?

Other House Republicans have echoed Johnson’s call, with nine signing on to a letter requesting a Department of Justice investigation. 

Neither Harris nor the election were mentioned in video and press materials released by Shapiro after the Scranton visit, which was conducted under tight security. 

In a separate letter, House Oversight and Accountability Committee Chair James Comer (R-Ky) announced an investigation into ”whether the Biden-Harris administration attempted to use a foreign leader to benefit Vice President Harris’s presidential campaign and, if so, necessarily committed an abuse of power.”

Other Democrats are pushing back as well.

“The Scranton Army Ammunition Plant is playing a critical role bolstering Ukraine’s forces, and I was honored to join President Zelenskyy to thank Pennsylvania workers for helping defend democracy,” Casey said in a social media post. (Photo by Commonwealth Media Services)

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s trip to a Scranton ammunition plant on Sunday has led to outrage, calls for a Ukrainian ambassador to be fired, and an investigation into whether the visit amounted to “misuse of government resources” by House Republicans. <image:9566>\

Gov. Josh Shapiro welcomes Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sept. They need to drop this.”

It all started Sunday when Zelenskyy visited the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant, accompanied by Gov. to be fired.

“The facility was in a politically contested battleground state, was led by a top political surrogate for Kamala Harris, and failed to include a single Republican because – on purpose – no Republicans were invited,” Johnson wrote in the letter. “The tour was clearly a partisan campaign event designed to help Democrats and is clearly election interference.”

But Jean-Pierre said that the Sunday visit to the ammo plant was requested by Ukraine, and not the Harris campaign or White House. presidential campaign, with the two candidates espousing sharply opposing views.

Harris has called for the United States to continue supporting Ukraine with military aid."

However, the article clarifies that Zelenskyy did not explicitly endorse Harris or any candidate during the visit, and includes a photo of Zelenskyy with Kamala Harris (<image:118637029>). Penn Capital-Star reports on the controversy surrounding Zelenskyy's Scranton visit, which led to accusations of election interference from Republicans. The White House and Pentagon defended the visit, stating it was requested by Ukraine, and that neither Harris nor the election were mentioned in the released materials (<image:9566>, <image:9561>).

The articles can be found at the following URLs: [https://www.timesnownews.com/world/us/us-news/did-volodymyr-zelenskyy-campaign-for-kamala-harris-in-pennsylvania-truth-behind-trumps-claim-article-118635844](https://www.timesnownews.com/world/us/us-news/did-volodymyr-zelenskyy-campaign-for-kamala-harris-in-pennsylvania-truth-behind-trumps-claim-article-118635844) and [https://penncapital-star.com/election-2024/white-house-pentagon-push-back-on-republican-criticism-of-zelenskyys-scranton-visit/](https://penncapital-star.com/election-2024/white-house-pentagon-push-back-on-republican-criticism-of-zelenskyys-scranton-visit/).


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that while JD Vance claimed Zelenskyy campaigned for Kamala Harris in Pennsylvania, the visit to Scranton did not include an explicit endorsement of Harris or any candidate. The White House and Pentagon defended the visit, stating that neither Harris nor the election were mentioned in released materials.

The claim is therefore **false**.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that while there were accusations of Zelenskyy campaigning for Kamala Harris in Pennsylvania, the evidence indicates that he did not explicitly endorse Harris or any candidate during his visit to Scranton. The White House and Pentagon also stated that neither Harris nor the election were mentioned in released materials. Therefore, the claim is not factually accurate. `false`

## Summary

, his draft law "On amendments to some laws of Ukraine in connection with the change of the electoral system for the election of people's deputies" proposed to hold the election with closed lists because the 60-day term to the snap election did not "leave any chances for the introduction of this system."[\[115\]](#cite_note-UPclosedlistsrejected-119)

Zelenskyy opposed targeting the Russian language in Ukraine and banning artists for their political opinions (such as those viewed by the Government as [anti-Ukrainian](/wiki/Anti-Ukrainian_sentiment "Anti-Ukrainian sentiment")
).[\[350\]](#cite_note-354)
[\[351\]](#cite_note-355)
 In April 2019, he stated that he was not against a [Ukrainian language](/wiki/Ukrainian_language "Ukrainian language")
 quota ([on radio and TV](/wiki/Ukrainization#Mass_media "Ukrainization")
), although he noted they could be tweaked.[\[352\]](#cite_note-/7212672/_Zelensky-356)
 He also said that Russian artists "who have turned into (anti-Ukrainian) politicians" should remain banned from entering Ukraine.[\[339\]](#cite_note-3daysbUpeZi-343)

In response to a petition demanding equal rights for same-sex couples, Zelenskyy affirmed that democracies were measured by how they ensure equal rights for all citizens, that "all people are free and equal in their dignity and rights",[\[353\]](#cite_note-LGBTNYT-357)
 and that the family "consists of persons who live together, are connected by common life, have mutual rights and obligations";[\[354\]](#cite_note-lgbtcnn-358)

 to review [civil partnerships](/wiki/Civil_union "Civil union")
 for same-sex couples and called this "part of the work on establishing and ensuring human rights and freedoms".[\[354\]](#cite_note-lgbtcnn-358)
 However, he said that [same-sex marriage](/wiki/Same-sex_marriage "Same-sex marriage")
 could not be introduced during wartime as this would require amending the Constitution of Ukraine, which defines marriage as "based on the free consent of a woman and a man", and the Constitution cannot be changed during martial law.[\[353\]](#cite_note-LGBTNYT-357)
[\[355\]](#cite_note-359)

 though [Holos](/wiki/Holos_(political_party) "Holos (political party)")
 MP [Inna Sovsun](/wiki/Inna_Sovsun "Inna Sovsun")
 criticised the lack of details about legal proposals for civil partnerships.[\[353\]](#cite_note-LGBTNYT-357)

On 2 December 2022, Zelenskyy said his administration would enter a bill in the Verkhovna Rada that would ban "religious organizations affiliated with centers of influence in the Russian Federation", referring to the [Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate)](/wiki/Ukrainian_Orthodox_Church_(Moscow_Patriarchate) "Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate)")
 (UOC-MP), from operating in Ukraine.[\[357\]](#cite_note-361)
 The bill was passed by parliament and signed by Zelenskyy in August 2024,[\[358\]](#cite_note-uocmp-362)
 after opposition parties protested the bill's delay.[\[359\]](#cite_note-uocmpdelay-363)
 The law treats each parish individually and gives it nine months to cut ties with the UOC-MP, following which a special commission will inspect individual parishes and file lawsuits against non-compliant ones; the court can then decide on a ban in each case.[\[360\]](#cite_note-uocmpexplain-364)

Extensive fighting in the border region since the war began in 2022 has intensified since Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk region last year.

The Ukrainian leader said he and Trump were joined by European leaders on the phone call.

"Our joint position with our partners is absolutely clear - the war must end. Thank you for the Kursk operation and for very brave steps," Zelenskyy told troops on the visit.

Rubio says US to decide on Russia sanctions soon

Marco Rubio said he is hopeful of making announcements later today on whether potential sanctions against Russia would still proceed this week. 

The US secretary of state said he had spoken to special envoy Steve Witkoff, who is on his way back from a trip to Russia, and would have more discussions throughout the day. 

He told reporters there would hopefully be some announcements soon: "Maybe positive, maybe not." 

The Kremlin said Witkoff held "useful and constructive" talks with Vladimir Putin today, two days before the expiry of a deadline set by Donald Trump for Russia to agree to peace in Ukraine or face new sanctions.

India: US tariffs 'unfair, unjustified and unreasonable'

Tariffs placed on India by the US over its imports of Russian oil are "unfair, unjustified and unreasonable", New Delhi's foreign ministry says.

Donald Trump earlier issued an executive order imposing an additional 25% tariff on India over its continued imports of Russian (see 15.10 post).

The US president said he believed declining global energy prices could pressure Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine.

In a statement, the Indian government labelled Trump's decision as "unfortunate", adding it will take "all actions necessary" to protect its national interests.

It says the country's imports are "based on market factors" and done with the objective of "ensuring the energy security of 1.4 billion people".

Ukraine war latest: Trump gives update on US-Putin talks - after doubling India tariffs in oil row
==================================================================================================

Donald Trump has hit India with new tariffs for buying Russian oil, while his envoy has held talks with Vladimir Putin in Moscow, two days before the US president's deadline for a ceasefire in the Ukraine war. Russia must end the war that it itself started. Thank you to everyone who stands with Ukraine."

'Russia isn't serious about Trump's deadline'

As we've mentioned, it appears the US will impose secondary sanctions on Russia on Friday - but is Moscow taking Washington seriously on its threats?

America's former ambassador to Ukraine says he's seen nothing from Trump in his seven months in office that would suggest he'd actually apply any serious sanctions on Moscow.

"The problem is that Trump set in the spring, maybe three times, deadlines of two weeks," Steven Pifer told [chief presenter Mark Austin](https://news.sky.com/author/mark-austin-983)
.

"Each time, the Russians did nothing to meet the deadline and Trump did nothing in terms of punitive measures against Moscow, so I'm not sure how serious they're treating this Friday deadline."

Pifer says that Vladimir Putin has consistently tried to portray himself as being prepared to engage with peace talks "without making any real compromise".

"I think what Putin is trying to do is string Trump along while he continues to let the Russian military do its thing against the Ukrainians on the ground."

Instead of placing tariffs on countries like India who still purchase Russian oil, Pifer says the best course of action to hurt Moscow would be to seize the nearly $300bn in frozen Russian assets and make those funds available for Ukraine. 

"That would signal to Putin that Ukraine will have the funding to continue this war for five, six, seven years."

President Donald Trump has traded barbs with Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy since the US-Russia talks in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on February 19, 2025 \[Nathan Howard/Reuters\]

By Claire Cranford and Louis Jacobson | PolitiFact

Published On 20 Feb 202520 Feb 2025

As the third anniversary of [Russia’s Ukraine invasion](/news/2022/2/24/putin-orders-military-operations-in-eastern-ukraine-as-un-meets)
 nears, United States President Donald Trump has offered a false version of history.

US and Russian representatives held [talks in Saudi Arabia](/news/2025/2/19/us-russia-talks-five-takeaways-from-rubio-lavrov-meeting-on-ukraine-war)
 this week that included a discussion on how to end the war in Ukraine. You should have ended it three years – you should have never started it, you could have made a deal.”

This clashes with the evidence that Russia sent a large invasion force into Ukraine in February 2022.

The notion that Kyiv “started it” – that it is to blame for an invasion that has killed an estimated 46,000 Ukrainian soldiers and at least 12,000 civilians – led to outrage in Ukraine and from its allies.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy responded that Trump “lives in this disinformation space”.

Trump’s deputy in his first term, Mike Pence, posted on February 19 on X, “Mr President, Ukraine did not ‘start’ this war. Zelenskyy has promised elections once martial law is lifted.

We asked the White House for evidence that Ukraine had started the war and received no response.

Russia’s attempt to blame Ukraine is part of a longstanding argument that does not stand up to scrutiny.

What happened in February 2022
------------------------------

As people were sleeping, Russian troops and tanks rolled into Ukraine and missiles poured down in what US military analysts called the [largest military operation](/news/2025/1/8/russia-gained-4000sq-km-of-ukraine-in-2024-how-many-soldiers-did-it-lose)
 in Europe since World War II. In Putin’s telling, “poor Russia was forced to rush to the persecuted Ukrainians’ defense and forestall NATO-inspired Ukrainian aggression”, Motyl said.

In 2023, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev echoed Putin’s stance, saying Ukraine is a part of Russia, but “we live in different apartments”.

Soon after the war started, more than 140 scholars signed a letter denouncing Putin’s narrative as “factually wrong, morally repugnant and deeply offensive to the memory of millions of victims of Nazism and those who courageously fought against it, including Russian and Ukrainian soldiers of the Red Army”.

As for Trump’s recent remark, it is a “distillation of these Russian talking points”, Herron said.

Our ruling
----------

Trump said Zelenskyy “started” the war in Ukraine with Russia.

On February 24, 2022, Russian forces launched an invasion of Ukraine, a country that the night before was at peace. Later, Trump dismissed complaints that Ukrainian officials were not invited to participate.

, answering reporters’ questions on February 18 at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Families packed belongings, swarmed ATMs and filling stations, and tried to flee the Russian invasion in cars, trains, planes and on foot.

How did the false talking point that Ukraine started the war begin?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

To set the stage for the invasion, Putin had long denied Ukraine was even a country, falsely characterising its history and culture, arguing the Ukrainians were simply Russians who needed to be brought back into the fold.

PolitiFact recognised Putin’s lies justifying the Ukraine war as “our 2022 Lie of the Year”.

In 1990, Ukraine’s parliament declared its independence from the Soviet Union, a call it repeated in August 1991. Since then, Putin has asserted that there is no such thing as a Ukrainian people separate from Russia.

“These claims were designed to deny the existence and agency of the Ukrainian nation,” Erik Herron, a West Virginia University political scientist and author of the book Elections and Democracy after Communism, told PolitiFact in 2022.

Yet, the history of Ukraine has involved several empires or states, some of which were entirely separate from Russia, Eugene Finkel, an associate professor with Johns Hopkins University’s School of Advanced International Studies, told PolitiFact on the eve of the war.

Putin set the table for the 2022 invasion with a 5,000-word essay in July 2021. The Road to Peace must be built on the Truth.”

After Zelenskyy’s comments, Trump piled on [more attacks](/news/2025/2/19/dictator-trump-feuds-with-zelenskyy-amid-negotiations-over-ukraine-war)
 on Truth Social, claiming the Ukrainian president “is very low in Ukrainian Polls” and is “a Dictator without Elections”.

In a Kyiv International Institute of Sociology poll conducted between February 4 and 9, Zelenskyy had a 57 percent trust rating among Ukrainians surveyed. That is down from 90 percent in May 2022, shortly after Russia’s invasion, but up from 52 percent in December 2024. [Russian President Vladimir Putin](/news/2025/2/19/putin-rates-us-talks-highly-says-russia-ready-to-negotiate-over-ukraine)
 announced it as a “special military operation” at 6am Moscow time (03:00 GMT) on February 24, 2022.

“The purpose of this operation is to protect people who, for eight years now, have been facing humiliation and genocide perpetrated by the Kyiv regime,” Putin said in a televised address."

Top Questions

### 

When did the Russia-Ukraine War begin?

The full-scale invasion of Ukraine by Russia on February 24, 2022, was the expansion of a war between the two countries that had begun in February 2014, when disguised Russian troops [covertly invaded and took control](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Ukraine-crisis#ref323583)
 of the Ukrainian autonomous republic of [Crimea](https://www.britannica.com/place/Crimea)
. It also estimated Ukrainian military casualties since 2022 to be 400,000, including an estimated 60,000–100,000 soldiers killed.

### 

Why did Vladimir Putin invade Ukraine in 2022?

[Vladimir Putin](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Vladimir-Putin)
’s invasion followed years of tension between [Russia](https://www.britannica.com/place/Russia)
 and [Ukraine](https://www.britannica.com/place/Ukraine)
 as Ukraine moved toward closer ties with the West, which Putin viewed as a threat to Russia’s influence. The overwhelming majority of these casualties, which were verified by UN personnel, occurred in Ukraine.

### 

How has Russia’s war against Ukraine affected Ukraine’s population?

More than eight million people fled Ukraine after Russia’s 2022 invasion, and a similar number were internally displaced. In March 2023 the International Criminal Court concluded that Russia’s mass kidnapping campaign constituted a war crime.

Russia’s [destruction of Kakhovka Dam](https://www.britannica.com/event/2022-Russian-invasion-of-Ukraine/The-Ukrainian-counterattack#ref374607)
 on the Dnipro River in June 2023 is also an example of how Russian forces have attacked Ukrainian infrastructure to inflict suffering on Ukraine’s population: some 240 square miles (620 square km) of territory were flooded, scores of people died, and dozens of towns were inundated, with up to 1 million people left without drinking water.

### 

How has the war in Ukraine impacted Russia’s military capabilities?

Russia’s visually confirmed losses as of early 2024 totaled more than 8,000 armored vehicles, including some 2,700 tanks. In recognition of Russia’s continued hybrid warfare campaign against Ukraine, the framework called for mediated talks between the two governments rather than any attempts at bilateral engagement.

Content: "Putin responded by invading Ukraine on February 24th, 2022.

Second, the Biden administration has reacted to the outbreak of the war by doubling down against Russia. In response, Russia seized Crimea from Ukraine and helped fuel a civil war that broke out in the Donbass between pro-Russian separatists and the Ukrainian government.

One often hears the argument that in the eight years between when the crisis broke out in February 2014 and when the war began in February 2022, the United States and its allies paid little attention to bringing Ukraine into NATO. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov made the point succinctly at a press conference on January 14th, 2022, when he said, “the key to everything is the guarantee that NATO will not expand eastward.”

Nevertheless, the efforts of Lavrov and Putin to get the United States and its allies to abandon their efforts to make Ukraine a Western bulwark on Russia’s border failed completely. The Causes and Consequences of the Ukraine War
==============================================

_**! We live in perilous times.

Let me now lay out my argument in greater detail, starting with a description of the conventional wisdom about the causes of the conflict.

The Conventional Wisdom

It is widely and firmly believed in the West that Putin is solely responsible for causing the Ukraine crisis and certainly the ongoing war. In his July 12th, 2021, article about Russian-Ukrainian relations, which proponents of the conventional wisdom often point to as evidence of his imperial ambitions, he tells the Ukrainian people, “You want to establish a state of your own: you are welcome!” Regarding how Russia should treat Ukraine, he writes, “There is only one answer: with respect.” He concludes that lengthy article with the following words: “And what Ukraine will be—it is up to its citizens to decide.” It is hard to reconcile these statements with the claim that he wants to incorporate Ukraine within a greater Russia.

In that same July 12th, 2021 article and again in an important speech he gave on February 21st, 2022, Putin emphasized that Russia accepts “the new geopolitical reality that took shape after the dissolution of the USSR.” He reiterated that same point for a third time on February 24th, 2022, when he announced that Russia would invade Ukraine. In short, Russia did not have the capability to subdue all of Ukraine, much less conquer other countries in Eastern Europe.

To take this argument a step further, Putin and other Russian leaders surely understand from the Cold War that occupying counties in the age of nationalism is invariably a prescription for never-ending trouble. Let me now turn to the real cause of the Ukraine crisis.

The Real Cause of the Crisis

The taproot of the crisis is the American-led effort to make Ukraine a Western bulwark on Russia’s borders. From his perspective, that would be a declaration of war.”

The Bush administration, which was pushing such a decision for NATO however, cared little about Moscow’s “brightest of red lines” and pressured the French and German leaders to agree to issuing a public pronouncement that said unequivocally that Ukraine and Georgia would eventually join the alliance.

Unsurprisingly, the American-led effort to integrate Georgia into NATO resulted in a war between Georgia and Russia in August 2008—just four months after the Bucharest summit. He made a series of moves—like shutting down pro-Russian TV stations and arresting an especially close friend of Putin and charging him with treason—that were sure to anger Moscow.

President Biden, who moved into the White House in January 2021, had long been committed to bringing Ukraine into NATO and was also super-hawkish towards Russia."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that the 2022 war began with a Russian invasion on February 24, 2022. While the claim suggests Zelenskyy started the war, the provided sources indicate that Russia initiated the full-scale invasion. The Britannica article states that the war between the two countries began in 2014, and the cirsd.org article mentions that the US and its allies' efforts to bring Ukraine into NATO were seen as a threat by Russia. An Al Jazeera article mentions that Donald Trump claimed Zelenskyy "started" the war.

The evidence does not support the claim that Zelenskyy started the war. The provided sources point to Russia's actions as the start of the 2022 escalation.

([https://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-war-latest-russia-rape-putin-zelenskyy-12541713](https://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-war-latest-russia-rape-putin-zelenskyy-12541713))

An Al Jazeera article from February 20, 2025, discusses the claim that Ukraine started the war with Russia, mentioning Donald Trump's statement that Zelenskyy "started" the war. The article states that Russian forces launched an invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022. <image:1> ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/20/fact-check-did-ukraine-start-its-war-with-russia-as-trump-claims](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/20/fact-check-did-ukraine-start-its-war-with-russia-as-trump-claims))


### Evidence from `web_search`
The Britannica article ([https://www.britannica.com/event/2022-Russian-invasion-of-Ukraine](https://www.britannica.com/event/2022-Russian-invasion-of-Ukraine)) states that the full-scale invasion began on February 24, 2022, but the war between the two countries began in February 2014. The article mentions that Russia began a massive buildup of troops along its border with Ukraine between October and November 2021. On February 21, 2022, Putin recognized the independence of the self-proclaimed people’s republics of Donetsk and Luhansk. The article includes images of the war <image:9153>, <image:9179>.

The article from cirsd.org ([https://www.cirsd.org/en/horizons/horizons-summer-2022-issue-no.21/the-causes-and-consequences-of-the-ukraine-war](https://www.cirsd.org/en/horizons/horizons-summer-2022-issue-no.21/the-causes-and-consequences-of-the-ukraine-war)) discusses the causes of the 2022 war in Ukraine, mentioning that Putin invaded Ukraine on February 24th, 2022. It also mentions the US and its allies' efforts to bring Ukraine into NATO, which Russia saw as a threat. The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine)) states that the Russian invasion of Ukraine began on February 24, 2022, escalating a conflict that started in 2014. The invasion followed Russia's build-up of troops near Ukraine's borders and demands to the West, including a ban on Ukraine joining NATO. The article also mentions the annexation of Crimea in 2014 <image:i>.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the 2022 war began with a Russian invasion on February 24, 2022. While the claim suggests Zelenskyy started the war, the provided sources indicate that Russia initiated the full-scale invasion. The Britannica article states that the war between the two countries began in 2014, and the cirsd.org article mentions that the US and its allies' efforts to bring Ukraine into NATO were seen as a threat by Russia. An Al Jazeera article mentions that Donald Trump claimed Zelenskyy "started" the war.

The evidence does not support the claim that Zelenskyy started the war. The provided sources point to Russia's actions as the start of the 2022 escalation.


# Your Judgement

“They may have their own relations, but talking about Ukraine without us — it is dangerous for everyone,” Zelenskyy said.

He said his team has been in contact with the Trump administration, but those discussions are at a “general level,” and he believes in-person meetings will take place soon to develop more detailed agreements.

“We need to work more on this,” he said, adding that Trump understandably appeared to be focused on domestic issues in the first weeks after his inauguration.

The nearly three-year war in Ukraine is at a crossroads. But a planned visit by [Trump’s Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg](https://apnews.com/article/trump-transition-ukraine-russia-war-kellogg-68b413ecde625f6643aebe5759a752e7)
, was postponed “for legal reasons” Zelenskyy said. [Membership in the NATO alliance](https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-nato-membership-summit-4156df4062e69e0da38e7c18bf657285)
, a longstanding wish for Kyiv that Moscow has categorically rejected, is still Zelenskyy’s top choice.

NATO membership is the “cheapest” option for Ukraine’s allies, and it would also strengthen Trump geopolitically, Zelenskyy argued.

“I really believe that these are the cheapest security guarantees that Ukraine can get, the cheapest for everyone,” he said.

“It will be a signal that it is not for Russia to decide who should be in NATO and who should not, but for the United States of America to decide."

When the office of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called AP’s senior producer in Kyiv, Volodymyr Yurchuk, to request a sit-down, on-camera interview within 24 hours, it marked a significant milestone. Their work has reinforced AP’s influence as a go-to news outlet for Zelenskyy’s most critical interviews.

For their tenacity, ingenuity, and hustle, the AP Kyiv team earns this week’s Best of AP — Second Winner.

AP Interview: Zelenskyy says excluding Ukraine from U.S.-Russia talks about war is ‘very dangerous’

[! While the Kyiv team has tirelessly lobbied the Ukrainian government for access and interviews throughout the country’s nearly three-year conflict with Russia—and secured previous sit-downs with Zelenskyy—this was the first time his office approached AP to propose an interview.

With just hours to prepare, the entire team sprang into action. Reporter Illia Novikov provided live, simultaneous translation, longtime photographer Efrem Lukatsky captured images, and Yurchuk produced the video.

The result: an hourlong interview in which Zelenskyy warned that excluding Ukraine from U.S.-Russia war talks is “very dangerous,” called for Kyiv and Washington to develop a ceasefire plan, and outlined his latest thinking on security guarantees needed for a peace deal and NATO membership.

The judges were impressed by the team’s ability to move quickly and deliver such a polished and impactful interview under intense time constraints. 29, 2025\

**Q1: What did President Zelensky say that started this controversy?**

:

When I hear that America gave Ukraine hundreds of billions \[of dollars\], 177, to be more precise . He speaks about supporting the “army” where aid helped all elements of the Ukrainian armed forces, and he appears to include only weapons as aid “received.”

**Q2: How was that interpreted?**

**A2:** Many people asked where the “missing” $100 billion went and seized on the statement, “I don’t know where all the money is.”

Comment sections of media reports [flamed with accusations of corruption and malfeasance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWcsdMUDDjc)

Critical Questions by [Mark F. surge forces in Europe, and intelligence support for both NATO and Ukraine.

As [CSIS has reported before](https://breakingdefense.com/2023/10/most-aid-to-ukraine-is-spent-in-the-us-a-total-shutdown-would-be-irresponsible/)
, “aid to Ukraine” is a misnomer because 90 percent of military aid is spent in the United States. We are talking about specific things, because we got it, not with money but with weapons. I don’t know where all the money is.

The statement is a bit confusing since he was speaking off the cuff in a video interview. Agency for International Development (USAID) payments to celebrities to visit Ukraine. [Members of Congress](https://x.com/NancyMace/status/1886175308086161522)
 and Elon Musk, who leads DOGE, [amplified](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1886132832495378684)
 posts questioning the misuse of aids.

General Keith Kellogg, the Trump administration’s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, denied these interpretations. In private conversations, Republican congressional staff members say that the confusion and hint of corruption have poisoned the possibility of further aid, at least in the near term.

**Q3: So, what happened to the “missing” $100 billion?**

**A3:** The short answer is that it is not missing."

US President [Donald Trump](/en/donald-trump/t-19434433)
 has hurled insults and personal attacks at the Ukrainian President [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](/en/volodymyr-zelenskyy/t-65603134)
 and has since doubled down in a [post on X](https://archive.is/4NhOr "External link — post on X")
, heading for 100 million views at the time this article was published.

Trump called Zelenskyy a "dictator without elections" who had lost the support of the Ukrainian people, telling him he "better move fast" to negotiate an end to [Russia's invasion of Ukraine](/en/russias-war-in-ukraine/t-60931789)
 or he might not have a country left, among other things.

On Thursday, the US requested a [joint press conference be canceled](/en/ukraine-zelenskyy-wants-strong-ties-to-united-states/live-71678356)
 after talks between Zelenskyy and Trump's Ukraine envoy in Kyiv.

DW's [Fact Check team](/en/fact-check/t-56584214)
 takes an in-depth look at Trump's claims.

Is Zelenskyy a dictator who is refusing to hold elections?    
--------------------------------------------------------------

**Claim:** Trump said Zelenskyy was a "dictator without elections."

**DW Fact check:** False.

Zelenskyy was elected to a five-year term in April 2019, winning 74.96% of the vote in a second-round run-off with incumbent Petro Poroshenko.

According to the [Ukrainian constitution](https://perma.cc/VBX9-NHRY "External link — Ukrainian constitution")
, the next presidential election ought to have taken place on the final Sunday of March 2024, but it was postponed due to the imposition of martial law.

[Article 19 of the Ukrainian law "On the Legal Regime of Martial Law"](https://archive.ph/1sxGv "External link — Article 19 of the Ukrainian law "On the Legal Regime of Martial Law"")
 explicitly prohibits the holding of national and local elections during a state of war. According to the report, about 57% of Ukrainians said they trusted Zelenskyy. An earlier poll published by the [International Republican Institute](https://www.iri.org/resources/national-survey-of-ukraine-sept-oct-2024/ "External link — International Republican Institute")
 last fall said that 69% of Ukrainians approved of his actions and 42% even strongly opposed elections for a new President.

Trump has not given a source for his single-digit claim.

In response, Zelenskyy said these false figures were part of Russia's disinformation campaign and the US President ["unfortunately lives in this disinformation space."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qoq3IqIT90I "External link — "unfortunately lives in this disinformation space."")

According to recent polls, the majority of Ukrainians are satisfied with Zelenskyy as presidentImage: President of Ukraine/ZUMA Press/IMAGO

Has the US spent $350 billion on Ukraine?
-----------------------------------------

**Claim**: "Zelenskyy talked the United States of America into spending $350 billion."

**DW Factcheck**: Unproven. 

Trump didn't provide any sources for these amounts and the sum differs greatly from figures published elsewhere.

According to the US government's [Ukraine oversight working group](https://archive.ph/YMO0u "External link — Ukraine oversight working group")
, the US contribution to Ukraine aid totals $203 billion: "Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Congress has appropriated or otherwise made available nearly $183 billion for Operation Atlantic Resolve and the broader Ukraine response. Article 71 of the Ukrainian constitution stipulates that elections are to be "free and take place on the basis of universal, equal and direct suffrage by secret ballot."

But with millions of Ukrainians serving in the armed forces, having fled the country, or living in areas occupied by the Russian army, it would be impossible to ensure the entire electorate is given an equal chance to vote by the required standards.

Is Zelenskyy running low in the polls?
--------------------------------------

**Claim:** Trump has claimed that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's approval ratings have plummeted, saying he was "very low in Ukrainian polls" with a ["4% approval rating."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VneqUgovNVI "External link — "4% approval rating."")

**DW Fact check:** False.

Zelenskyy "retains a fairly high level of public trust," a poll conducted by the [Kyiv International Institute of Sociology](https://www.kiis.com.ua/?lang=eng&cat=reports&id=1496&page=1 "External link — Kyiv International Institute of Sociology")
 found in early February 2025. Additionally, the United States provided $20 billion in loans as part of the G7 nations extraordinary revenue acceleration loans initiative."

However, in reporting about Ukraine aid, the media often cite data collected by the [Ukraine Support Tracker (UST)](https://www.ifw-kiel.de/topics/war-against-ukraine/ukraine-support-tracker/ "External link — Ukraine Support Tracker (UST)")
, a project by the German think tank, the Kiel Institute for the World Economy. Which is significantly less than the official US figures.

When asked about the gap between these figures and Trump's $350 billion claim, UST project leader Taro Nishikawa told DW: "This figure appears to be based on a different calculation and definition of aid. It may also include categories that we do not track in our dataset."

Can Ukraine-attached spending explain the gap?
----------------------------------------------

The UST's [dataset documentation](https://www.ifw-kiel.de/fileadmin/Dateiverwaltung/Subject_Dossiers_Topics/Ukraine/Ukraine_Support_Tracker/Dataset_Documentation.pdf "External link — dataset documentation")
 shows how difficult it is to define Ukraine aid.

For example, UST calculations do not include activities such as the training of Ukrainian soldiers, aid from NGOs that may be co-financed by governments or incentives for companies to donate to Ukraine. There are also multi-billion military and intelligence expenses by the US Department of Defense and the United States European Command which are dedicated to the region, but not exclusively to Ukraine.

At the same time, some analysts say that a large share of Ukraine's aid remains in the US economy.

[According to the US publication _Lawfare_](https://archive.ph/0meEI "External link — According to the US publication Lawfare")
: "Only a small percentage of the overall aid package takes the form of cash transfers to Kyiv." A significant part of the aid, the author writes, consists in paying US soldiers to train Ukrainian troops, or in sending weapons, ammunition and other military equipment from US stocks dedicated to rapid military aid under the [Foreign Assistance Act](https://perma.cc/J9ZN-8L37 "External link — Foreign Assistance Act")
. These stocks are then refilled by the US military industry.  While the US was subsidizing their economy the US government is still donating weaponry to Ukraine.

Even if you were to factor in all the funding somehow related to the war in Ukraine the UST had excluded from the grand total (see "Summary of US Acts" table), that would bring the overall US aid commitment for Ukraine up to $213 billion as of April 24, 2024 – a sum that surpasses the official figure, but still falls short of Trump's $350 billion claim.

Who has spent more on Ukraine: the USA or Europe?
-------------------------------------------------

**Claim**: "The United States has spent $200 billion more than Europe."

The claim fits Trump's talking point of everybody taking advantage of the US. With what Trump refers to as "Europe" giving shelter to more than 70%, and the US receiving less than 5% of them, his claim does not appear any more reasonable.

Content: "2 interview with The Associated Press, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that Ukraine received a total of $76 billion in military assistance from the U.S as opposed to the reported $177 billion.

Russia’s ex-president, now deputy chairman of the Security Council of Russia, Dmitry Medvedev seized on Zelenskyy’s interview to claim in a Telegram post that the Ukrainian president “confessed” to being involved in the theft of $100 billion allocated by the United States to support Ukraine.

Medvedev used the name of a [controversial WWII figure Stepan Bandera](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2021/03/19/in-ukraine-stepan-bandera-s-legacy-becomes-a-political-football-again)
, one the prominent leaders of the Ukrainian Anti-Soviet rebellion, who joined the German Nazi regime for a promise of independence.

“In the heat of candor, the leader of the Bandera regime admitted that he and his comrades had embezzled $100 billion,” [Medvedev wrote](https://t.me/medvedev_telegram/563)

This claim is false.

Since the full-scale Russian military invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the U.S. Of that, $106 billion is designated for direct support to Ukraine, comprising some $69.8 billion in military aid, $33.3 billion for budget support, and $2.8 billion in humanitarian assistance, as tracked by the Washington, D.C.-based [Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-us-aid-going-ukraine)
.

The remaining funds support U.S. aid to countries affected by Russia’s war in Ukraine. military aid to Ukraine, reporting that most of it is spent in the U.S., used to build new weapons or replenish U.S. Nearly 90% of the $68 billion in military assistance benefits American workers, with 117 production lines across 31 states and 71 cities producing weapons for Ukraine.

_The Post_’s findings corroborated [earlier estimates](https://breakingdefense.com/2023/10/most-aid-to-ukraine-is-spent-in-the-us-a-total-shutdown-would-be-irresponsible/)

Kellogg also confirmed that part of the allocated funds has been used to produce weapons in the U.S. weapons stockpiles.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
Zelenskyy stated in an interview with the Associated Press that Ukraine received $76 billion out of $177 billion in U.S. aid. The U.S. has provided $175 billion in aid to Ukraine. The claim that Zelenskyy's statement confirms the U.S. aid is a money laundering operation is not directly supported by the evidence. The evidence does show that a portion of the aid has not been received, which has led to questions about where the remaining funds have gone. However, the evidence does not provide enough information to confirm the claim.

## Elaboration
Zelenskyy stated in an interview with the Associated Press that Ukraine received $76 billion out of $177 billion in U.S. aid. The U.S. has provided $175 billion in aid to Ukraine. The claim that Zelenskyy's statement confirms the U.S. aid is a money laundering operation is not directly supported by the evidence. The evidence does show that a portion of the aid has not been received, which has led to questions about where the remaining funds have gone. However, the evidence does not provide enough information to confirm the claim.

 would be “very dangerous" and asked for more discussions between Kyiv and Washington to develop a plan for a ceasefire.

Speaking in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press, Zelenskyy said Russia does not want to engage in ceasefire talks or to discuss any kind of concessions, which the Kremlin interprets as losing at a time when its troops have [the upper hand on the battlefield](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-donetsk-pokrovsk-8461cfeef0cf7850c292b4a8ff24c88f)

He said U.S. President Donald Trump could bring Russian President Vladimir Putin to the table with the threat of sanctions targeting Russia’s energy and banking system, as well as continued support of the Ukrainian military.

“I think these are the closest and most important steps,” he said in the interview in the Ukrainian capital that lasted for more than an hour.

Zelenskyy's remarks followed comments Friday by Trump, who said American and Russian officials were [“already talking”](https://apnews.com/article/trump-putin-russia-ukraine-6c5a098488e64cd7643a89f4aaacd249)

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says that excluding his country from talks between the U\_S\_ and Russia about the war in Ukraine would be “very dangerous.”

By Associated Press

|

Feb. (AP Photo/Efrem Lukatsky)

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Saturday that excluding his country from talks between the U.S. [Trump](https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump)
 said his administration has had “very serious” discussions with Russia, but he did not elaborate.

“They may have their own relations, but talking about Ukraine without us — it is dangerous for everyone,” Zelenskyy said.

He said his team has been in contact with the Trump administration, but those discussions are at a “general level,” and he believes in-person meetings will take place soon to develop more detailed agreements.

“We need to work more on this,” he said, adding that Trump understandably appeared to be focused on domestic issues in the first weeks after his inauguration.

The nearly three-year war in Ukraine is at a crossroads. In those areas, Moscow-appointed authorities are swiftly erasing any hint of Ukrainian identity.

With Trump back in the White House, Ukraine’s relationship with the U.S., its largest and most important ally, is also at a tipping point.

In an initial phone call with Trump during the presidential campaign, Zelenskyy said, they agreed that if Trump won, they would meet to discuss the steps needed to end the war. But how will it turn out I don’t know.”

Zelenskyy cautioned against allowing Putin to take “control" over the war, an apparent reference to to Russia's repeated threats of escalation during President Joe Biden's administration.

Without security guarantees from Ukraine’s allies, Zelenskyy said, any deal struck with Russia would only serve as a precursor to future aggression."

## Claim
Claim: "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's statement in an AP news interview from February 1, 2025 that his country's military has received only a portion of the more than 175 billion in U.S. aid confirms that the US aid is a money laundering operation."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
An AP News article from an interview with Volodymyr Zelenskyy on February 1, 2025, discusses the war in Ukraine and the exclusion of Ukraine from talks between the U.S. and Russia. Zelenskyy stated that excluding Ukraine from these talks would be "very dangerous" (<image:9598>). The interview was conducted in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Saturday, February 1, 2025. The article also mentions Zelenskyy's view that NATO membership is the "cheapest" option for Ukraine's allies.

The U.S. News & World Report also published an article on February 1, 2025, discussing the AP interview with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (<image:0>). The article mentions Zelenskyy's statements about talks between Moscow and Washington, which should not exclude Ukraine.

### **CLAIM**

Posts claimed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed artillery shells destined to be dropped on Gaza during a visit to a Pennsylvania munitions factory.

* * *

### **BACKGROUND**

A video and still images shared online were described as showing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing artillery shells destined for use in Gaza by Israel.

One [version](https://x.com/firasshams1/status/1896565304148574479)
 of video was circulated online at the beginning of March with the caption: “For those feeling sorry for Volodymyr Zelensky, here’s the Ukrainian President signing bombs to be dropped on innocent Gazans”. Zelensky signing bombs that killed Palestinian women and children”.

* * *

### **METHOD**

The video of Zelenskyy and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro signing artillery shells began to circulate online following an eventful meeting at the White House between Zelenskyy, President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance on February 28 which turned into a near-shouting match. [![Eurovision News | Spotlight](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!u-Oh!,w_80,h_80,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82236b8f-82a2-4d9e-bc4b-1a00add2558a_1280x1280.png)](/)

 \[Accessed 13 Mar. During the meeting, Trump told Zelenskyy to make a deal with Russia to end the war in Ukraine. He also told Zelenskyy he was “[gambling with World War III](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/28/trump-vance-zelenskyy-oval-office-exchange-00206727)
”.

A reverse Google Image search of a screen shot from the video however revealed that it was published several months before the fateful White House meeting.

Governor Josh Shapiro shared the video on September 23, 2024, with a caption referencing Ukraine’s war with Russia. This version allowed us to see that Zelenskyy wrote “Glory to Ukraine” on one shell and “Thanks for Support” on another, both referencing Ukraine’s war with Russia and not Israel’s war in Gaza.

[Information](https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/prezident-vidvidav-skrentonskij-armijskij-boyepripasnij-zavo-93389)
 about Zelenskyy’s visit to the ammunition factory, as well as details on its operations, was provided on Ukraine’s official government website.

“The plant’s capacity is fully dedicated to meeting Ukraine’s needs, particularly for the production of 155mm shells, which has significantly increased over the past year,” the statement read.

A statement regarding the visit was also released on the U.S. Army [website](https://www.army.mil/article/279911/ukrainian_president_zelenskyy_tours_scranton_army_ammunition_plant)
 which confirmed the factory was being used to bolster Ukraine’s ammunition stockpile.

* * *

### **RATING**

The video shows Zelenskyy visiting a munitions factory that produces armaments for the Ukrainian Security and Defense Forces, not Israel. It was published five months before the February 2025 meeting and a longer version of the video reveals that Zelenskyy’s handwritten messages do not reference Ukraine’s war with Russia or Israel’s war in Gaza. Available at: [For those feeling sorry for Volodymyr Zelensky](https://x.com/firasshams1/status/1896565304148574479)

# Your Summary

The search result from Eurovision News | Spotlight states that the claim that Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed artillery shells destined to be dropped on Gaza is false.

"He called Trump and Vance ‘radical’. – locked in a tight re-election race with businessman David McCormick – was seen shaking hands with Zelenskyy as Shapiro wrote a message on the missile.

Other critics pointed out that chaos was erupting elsewhere in the commonwealth while Shapiro, Zelenskyy and Casey were touring the ordnance plant.

Pennsylvania Gov. (Charles Creitz)

In an official statement, Shapiro said Pennsylvania is the "birthplace of American freedom" and Pennsylvanians therefore stand with Ukrainians in their fight against "naked aggression."

He also noted Pennsylvania will sign an agreement with the Ukrainian state of Zaporizhizhia that will "foster collaboration for years to come."

In regard to the agreement, Pennsylvania Secretary of Community & Economic Development Rick Siger [told WHTM](https://www.abc27.com/pennsylvania/shapiro-zelenskyy-sign-agreement-establishing-partnership-between-pennsylvania-ukrainian-province/)
 that the pact will "help support the future economic revitalization of Ukraine, while boosting our economy and creating jobs for Pennsylvanians."

Fox News Digital reached out to Shapiro and Casey for further comment but did not receive a response at press time.

While at the plant, Zelenskyy inscribed messages of gratitude on US bombs, including the phrase “Glory to Ukraine.” Democratic Governor Josh Shapiro, who was present during the signing, appeared supportive of the gesture. “Because you’re signing bombs that could potentially kill innocent people.

!loading <image:3679> There’s innocent on both sides.”

The backlash against Zelenskyy’s visit was further amplified by political commentators and Republican leaders. Reports indicate that Zelenskyy’s remarks about the Republican candidate for US vice president, whom he labeled as radical, only fueled this perception.

Senator Lindsey Graham, a prominent Republican figure, also condemned Zelenskyy's presence at the military plant, asserting that such actions could jeopardize Ukraine’s long-term objectives in its fight against Russia. “We need to ensure that incidents like this do not detract from the long-term goals of ensuring success for Ukraine,” Graham remarked.

Republican anger clouds Zelensky-Biden 'victory plan' meeting

Volodymyr Zelensky (left) and Joe Biden said they would focus on Ukraine's "victory plan" at their White House talks

Volodymyr Zelensky is meeting Joe Biden and Kamala Harris at the White House to discuss his "victory plan", which the Ukrainian president hopes will pressure Russia into agreeing a diplomatic end to the war.

Details have been kept secret, but Zelensky is likely to ask the US president and vice-president for continuing military and financial support, as well as security guarantees.

It comes amid a row with Donald Trump and the Republican party ahead of November's US presidential election.

They were angered by Zelensky's visit to an arms factory in Biden's hometown of Scranton with top Democrats. Zelensky will meet Trump on Friday despite earlier reports that the meeting had been cancelled.

Zelensky's visit to the ammunition factory in the key swing state of Pennsylvania was labelled by leading Republicans as a partisan campaign event.

In a public letter, speaker of the US House Mike Johnson said the visit was "designed to help Democrats" and claimed it amounted to "election interference".

He also demanded that Ukraine fire its ambassador to Washington who helped arrange the visit.

The Republican-led House Oversight Committee has also announced it would investigate whether Zelensky's trip was an attempt to use a foreign leader to benefit Harris's campaign.

Her Republican rival for the presidency, Donald Trump, mocked Zelensky at a campaign event as the "greatest salesman on Earth" and accused him of refusing to "make a deal" with Moscow.

Earlier this week, Trump also praised Russia's military capabilities, saying: "They beat Hitler, they beat Napoleon - that’s what they do, they fight."

The two men have long had a fractious relationship. In 2019, Trump was impeached by the US House over accusations that he pressured Ukraine's leader to dig up damaging information on a political rival.

The row clouded a week in which Zelensky has twice addressed the United Nations, ramping up efforts to persuade the US and other allies to boost support more than two and a half years into Russia's full-scale invasion.

At the White House meetings, Zelensky is expected to push again for US backing to fire Western-made long-range missiles deep into Russian territory, which Biden has so far blocked.

Before the meeting, Biden said: "Let me be clear, Russia will not prevail in war... Ukraine will prevail".

He also pledged to support Kyiv "in its path to membership to both the EU and Nato".

Meanwhile, Zelensky thanked the US for its "unwavering bipartisan support".

He later met Harris, with the vice-president reiterating her support for Ukraine and arguing the US must continue its role of global leadership.

With Russian troops advancing in the east of Ukraine, the outcome of Zelensky's meeting with Biden and Harris is seen by many experts as a key moment in his attempt to shore up US support before the November election.

On Wednesday, Russia's Vladimir Putin announced a plan to revise Moscow's nuclear doctrine, to enable Russia to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states if they are supported by nuclear states.

Putin's spokesperson later clarified that it was meant as a "specific signal" to the West.

Hours before his meeting with Zelensky, Biden announced a $7.9bn (£5.9bn) package of military assistance to Ukraine.

The aid, part of a $61bn package that passed Congress in April, will be approved through presidential drawdown authority and will pull from existing Pentagon supplies to deliver the arms more quickly.

Congressional Republicans blocked the package for months earlier this year, before ultimately relenting and passing the legislation. The delay caused arms supplies to Ukraine to dry up for several months.

Zelensky thanked the US - Ukraine's largest foreign donor.

At the same time, he also reportedly expressed frustration at the delay in delivering weapons that were already promised when he met US congressmen on Thursday morning.

What was [Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky](https://nypost.com/2024/09/25/us-news/house-gop-accuses-kamala-harris-of-using-zelensky-as-campaign-surrogate-launches-foreign-interference-inquiry/)
 doing at what sure _looked_ like a partisan US political event this week?

And how did the White House let this happen?

Zelensky got flown into battleground Pennsylvania aboard a USAF C-17 plane on Tuesday; he then toured the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant accompanied by Gov. Josh Shapiro, Sen. Bob Casey, Rep. Matt Cartwright — the last two being active Democratic candidates.

And it looks like no GOP candidates got invited — trapping a foreign head of state into apparently taking sides in US domestic politics.

Yet Zelensky was guarded by Secret Service agents and driven around in Secret Service vehicles, adding more reek of impropriety: Who covered those expenses?

Someone in the Biden administration pulled a fast one: Pennsylvania has a fair number of anti-Russian Polish-Americans and others of Eastern European heritage who might be swayed by Zelensky’s seeming preference.

Legalities aside, this is terrible for Zelensky: Ukraine desperately needs support from Republicans as well as Democrats in Congress, and will no matter who holds the White House next year.

House Speaker Mike Johnson is calling on Zelensky to fire his US ambassador for letting this disgrace happen, a move that could mend _Ukraine’s_ fences here.

But Congress will need answers on the American side, too: After all, Democrats impeached President Donald Trump over _his_ supposed abuses linked to Ukraine; now we have the misuse of a foreign guest’s visit to influence US politics.

We absolutely endorse US support of Kyiv against Moscow’s brutal invasion: Vladimir Putin must not succeed.

And Democratic candidates have every right to slam those Republicans who want to hang Ukraine out to dry.

But dragging any foreign leader, _especially_ one who’s seeking now new support for his nation from the White House, into US politics is morally criminal — at least.

Whether at the White House or the State Department, _American_ heads need to roll over this."

Misleading claims targeting the German chancellor have been spreading online days before German voters head to the polls to elect a new government.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](https://static.euronews.com/website/images/logos/logo-euronews-stacked-outlined-72x72-grey-9.svg) ADVERTISEMENT

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has not ordered a state of emergency in Germany over the US’s bilateral peace negotiations with Russia, despite the claim spreading widely across social platforms.

Users on X, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok falsely accused Scholz of urging parliament to impose a state of emergency — known as "Notstand" in German — that would severely curtail citizens’ rights.

But a closer look at Scholz’s speech reveals he was referring to "Notlage", an entirely different concept in the German Basic Law that refers to an urgent situation, but which is not synonymous with a government-imposed state of emergency.

Speaking over the weekend as the Trump administration geared for talks with Russian officials in the Saudi Arabian capital, Riyadh, Scholz said: “The Bundestag should pass a resolution as soon as possible according to which the war in Ukraine and its serious consequences for the security of Germany and Europe are classified as an emergency (Notlage) within the meaning of Article 115 paragraph two of the Basic Law.”

The article referenced by Scholz states that natural disasters or “exceptional emergency situations” can justify changes to the country’s so-called debt brake, allowing the government to borrow beyond the credit limit.

**What is the debt brake and how could it be used to finance defence spending?**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Germany has strict limits on government borrowing, known as a debt brake. It’s aimed at restricting the budget deficit to less than 0.35% of the country’s annual gross domestic product (GDP).

The debt brake became legally binding for the government in 2016 and for the federal states in 2020.

In recent months, both Scholz’ Social Democrats (SPD) and the Greens have advocated for suspending the debt brake in response to the war in Ukraine and the ensuing energy crisis.

Scholz’s other coalition partners, the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP), fiercely opposed the move, contributing to a breakdown in trust that collapsed the three-way coalition government last November.

Scholz has said he expects the next government, which will be elected on Sunday, to trigger this article to ramp up its spending on defence and security.

The Christian Democrats’ Friedrich Merz, who is tipped to become the next German chancellor, has also expressed [**openness**](https://www.euronews.com/business/2025/02/10/chancellor-hopeful-merz-open-to-reform-of-germanys-debt-brake)
 to loosening the debt brake once other options have been exhausted.

This is despite a broad camp of his CDU party opposing any changes to Germany's strict borrowing limits.

**Misleading claims spread days before crunch vote**
----------------------------------------------------

The misleading claims targeting Scholz come days before German voters head to the ballot boxes to elect a new government.

The Conservative Christian Democrats (CDU/CSU) are poised to emerge as the biggest party and form a government, but could be forced to rely on the support of Scholz's Social Democratic Party to do so.

The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party is currently polling in second place.

There is concern that coordinated misinformation campaigns, including those engineered by the Kremlin, could put the integrity of the vote at risk.

A German non-profit has detected Russia's well-known "Doppelgänger" campaign resurfacing, cloning the websites of renowned media outlets by purchasing similar-looking domains to spread falsified news articles.

The European Commission has attempted to minimise risks by engaging with social media platforms, including in a roundtable in Berlin and a recent [**stress test**](https://www.euronews.com/next/2025/01/24/online-platforms-participate-in-stress-test-ahead-of-german-election)
 of their of their risk mitigation measures.

Scholz proposes declaring state of emergency in Germany due to war in Ukraine
=============================================================================

!Scholz proposes declaring state of emergency in Germany due to war in Ukraine <image:9654> German Chancellor Olaf Scholz (photo: Getty Images)

Author: [Kateryna Serohina](https://newsukraine.rbc.ua/author/kateryna-serohina.html)

The Bundestag should recognize the war in Ukraine as a state of emergency in terms of its consequences for Germany and Europe. Given the recent statements from representatives of the Trump administration, this issue can no longer be postponed, according to a [statement](https://x.com/Bundeskanzler/status/1890119800556339565)
 from the head of the government for the press.

According to Chancellor Olaf Scholz, the Bundestag must urgently pass a resolution classifying the war in Ukraine and its serious consequences for the security of Germany and Europe as a state of emergency under Article 115, paragraph 2 of the Constitution.

"As a result, our support for Ukraine, which is more crucial than ever, will no longer come at the expense of other tasks that our state must carry out for its citizens," the chancellor emphasized.

Scholz stressed that this is about the peace and security of our country. German Defense Minister Boris [Pistorius described these statements as concessions to Russia before negotiations even begin.](https://newsukraine.rbc.ua/news/german-defense-minister-warns-us-against-1739441277.html)

**Collective defense and security**
-----------------------------------

Chancellor Scholz also intends to advance the discussion within the EU on methods of investing in collective defense and building a powerful European defense industry.

He reminded that, at one point, he made serious decisions to decisively respond to the turning point marked by the start of Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine.

"Today, we find ourselves in a similar situation. I will not allow that to happen at this critical time for our country," the German leader promised.

**Controversial US plan to end the war in Ukraine**
---------------------------------------------------

US President Donald Trump held a telephone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 12.

Following the call, the White House stated that there was a good opportunity to end the war.

Subsequently, several Trump administration officials asserted that [Ukraine is unable to regain control of the territories occupied by Russia since 2014](https://newsukraine.rbc.ua/news/pentagon-chief-doubts-ukraine-can-return-1739370284.html)
. Today, we must confront the reality of what the actions and statements from the US administration mean for Ukraine, Europe, and the world. Failure to act will mean a threat to the security of our country and our continent. US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegset also acknowledged that Ukraine’s NATO membership should not be part of peace negotiations, while Trump rejected the idea of Ukraine joining the Alliance, stating that Russia will not allow it.

Many Western media outlets speculate that the direct conversation between Trump and Putin could indicate that the U.S."

BERLIN, Feb 13 (Reuters) - There must be no imposed peace in Ukraine and any solution to the conflict must involve the United States, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in an interview with Politico released on Thursday but conducted a day earlier.

"It is very clear to me that there must be no solution that does not also involve the U.S.," Scholz said.

As President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin prepare to [meet in Alaska](https://www.npr.org/2025/08/08/nx-s1-5347716/trump-putin-meeting)
 later this week, European leaders have stressed that Ukraine must be included in any talks with Russia over ending the war in Ukraine.

Leaders including French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said they welcome Trump's work to "stop the killing in Ukraine," but that the "path to peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without Ukraine."

"We are convinced that only an approach that combines active diplomacy, support to Ukraine and pressure on the Russian Federation to end their illegal war can succeed," the leaders wrote in a [joint statement](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/joint-leaders-statement-on-peace-for-ukraine)
 issued on Saturday.

The European leaders also stressed in their joint statement a need for "robust and credible security guarantees" that allow Ukraine to defend its territory.

Their statement follows a meeting that Vice President JD Vance and U.K. Vance said in an interview recorded before his overseas meeting that the meeting between Trump and Putin represents a "major breakthrough for American diplomacy."

"We're going to try to find some negotiated settlement that the Ukrainians and the Russians can live with where they can live in relative peace, where the killing stops," Vance told Maria Bartiromo in [an interview](https://www.foxnews.com/video/6376764434112)
 on Fox News' _Sunday Morning Futures._

"It's not going to make anybody super happy. "We're at a point now … we're now trying to figure out, frankly, scheduling and things like that, around when these three leaders could sit down and discuss an end to this conflict," he said, speaking about Trump, Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Zelenskyy has said he supports Trump's efforts to leverage a peace deal, but it is still unclear whether he will attend the meeting. Zelenskyy has maintained that Ukraine will not give up any land, and said it is up to Putin to end the war.

"The Ukrainian people deserve peace. Foreign Secretary David Lammy held with Ukrainian and European officials over the weekend in London.

Trump is set to meet with Putin on Friday in Alaska to discuss an end to the war. But all partners must understand what a dignified peace is. "Ukrainians will not gift their land to the occupier."

And that ends their press conference.

Separately, chancellor **Merz** also **pushed back against US president Donald Trump’s questioning the EU’s digital regulations**, stressing it was an expression of the bloc’s sovereignty.

“We are doing this in our own interest and solely for our own interest, and **we will certainly not be guided by statements that perhaps consider completely different**, perhaps even no, **regulation** **necessary** and important,” he said.

Germany’s **Merz** **warned in turn that the war could go on for “many months”** as he questioned Vladimir Putin’s commitments to progress the peace talks.

He pointed out that **the original discussion focused on hosting a bilateral summit between Putin and Zelenskyy within two weeks**, and yet **the Russian president remained “clearly unwilling” to follow through on this plan.**

“Frankly, **this doesn’t surprise me, because it’s part of the Russian president’s strategy to proceed in the same way,”** he said.

Instead, he stressed **the importance of working together within the Coalition of the Willing** and putting even more pressure on Russia to come to the table.

During the press conference, **Macron** also reiterated that **a just and lasting peace is only possible if [Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine)
 gets strong security guarantees.**

He added that **they both hoped that Russia’s Putin would move ahead with the bi- or trilateral meeting on ending the war**, as committed to in conversations with president Trump.

But **Macron warned that if Putin was to miss the Monday deadline, it would have been another example of him trying to “play” Trump**, which he said could not go unanswered, and should prompt further sanctions.

He indicated that both him and Merz could speak with Trump over the weekend.

Speaking at a joint press conference just now, **Emmanuel Macron** also **stressed the need for the two countries to work together on industrial and digital policies**, saying they would improve their digital sovereignty and competitiveness in “cutting-edge technologies.”

The president also said they were **determined to preserve the EU’s legislation on digital,** which can be seen as an indirect response to US president Donald Trump’s repeated comments expressing his frustration with the bloc’s rulebooks, which he sees as discriminating American technology.

He also signalled **France and Germany would work together more closely on other issues,** including the future of the automotive industry, steel, climate policies, and migration.

We are also getting first news lines from **Toulon**, where French president **Emmanuel Macron** and German chancellor **Friedrich Merz** attended the **25th Franco-German Council of Ministers**.

A joint statement from the meeting includes a **commitment to start what is called as “strategic dialogue” over nuclear deterrence and more broadly linking the two countries’ security policies,** agencies reported.

Importantly for Kyiv, it is also reported to **include a pledge to provide more air defence systems to [Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine)
,** adding that “despite intensive international diplomatic efforts, Russia shows no intention to end its war of aggression against Ukraine”.

EU spokesperson for foreign affairs **Anitta Hipper** said:

> _“The European External Action Service under the leadership of the HR/VP **has summoned the Chargé d’Affaires of the Russian mission** to the European Union, **Karen Malayan** yesterday._
> 
> _**Clear messages have been passed.**_
> 
> _Firstly, **Russian reckless attacks** resulted in the death of at least 23 people, including 4 children._
> 
> _Secondly, on the fact that **the damages to the EU Delegations are serious and constitute a violation of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.** Inviolability of diplomatic premises and personnel is to be respected in all cases._
> 
> _And thirdly, **the EU will not stop to support Ukraine.**_
> 
> _**Russia must stop killing and negotiate.”**_

Meanwhile, **Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s top aide, Andriy Yermak, met with US peace envoy Steve Witkoff in New York.**

Yermak said the meeting, which he attended together with Ukraine’s first deputy minister of foreign affairs **Serhii Kyslytsia**, was intended to **“push for real diplomacy and the implementation of all agreements of the Washington summit.”**

He said that the Ukrainian delegation **told Witkoff about “all the war crimes that [Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia)
 commits daily against our cities and communities,”** including Thursday’s attack on Kyiv, which killed 23 people.

“Unfortunately**, Russia is not doing anything necessary to end the war and is obviously prolonging the hostilities,”** he warned.

He told Witkoff that **Ukraine is “open to direct talks at the leadership level,”** ramping up further pressure on making the bi- or trilateral summit with Zelenskyy, Putin and potentially Trump happen in near future.

Yermak also said **he invited Witkoff to visit Ukraine “in the near future.”**

Given the domestic political context in France, with **François Bayrou’s** government widely expected to collapse next month, **Macron’s comments that he intends to serve out the rest of his term** are also making headlines.

The president told reporters that **he had a long discussion with Bayrou about his plan**, and appeared to back his plan for a crunch vote in parliament, saying the situation required a principled discussion about key issues.

Asked about his future, he insisted that “**the mandate which has been given to me** by the French people, and by no-one else, is a mandate that **will be carried out through to the end of its term.”**

**Colm McGivern**, the director of **the British Council in Ukraine**, said a security guard had been injured and **the cultural organisation’s headquarters had been “rendered unusable” by damage from Thursday’s Russian air strikes on Kyiv.**

**No evidence has emerged to suggest the council was deliberately targeted by Moscow,** though McGivern said “what I do know is that **Russia has targeted educational and cultural infrastructure in Ukraine repeatedly”**.

A neighbouring building in the city centure was struck at 5.40am and **the ensuing blast wave from the explosion blew out the British Council’s windows**, destroyed its ceilings and left its computers non functional, the director said.

Such was the damage that a security guard, on night watch was injured and hospitalised. No other employees were on the site at the time.

McGivern said that t**he 120 staff of the unit, 119 of whom are Ukrainian, had resolved to continue with the British Council’s cultural activities despite the loss of the premises for the foreseeable future**, including supporting the Kyiv International Short Film Festival next week.

“It was another night where Ukraine has been subject to a barbaric attack,” McGivern said. **“There is a palpable level of anger and colleagues are more determined than ever to do all they can,** to act on the things they can control, which is strengthen the relationship with the UK”.

_in Brussels_

Our Brussels correspondent **Jennifer Rankin** has asked the European Commission for more details about its summoning of the Russian charges d’affaires yesterday, after a Russian strike in Kyiv hit the EU delegation building and the British Council offices, among others.

 the Republican senators both to weaken the bill’s provisions and to delay its introduction. They are still heeding his request, but impatience is growing, as evidenced by a June 12 [statement](https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=511A8563-0D4C-4513-9131-467AAC383A3B)
 from US Senator Lindsay Graham (R-SC), the bill’s original sponsor. Trump’s posturing—floating the idea of sanctions even while he refrains from imposing them—helps the White House manage this pressure, but this can continue indefinitely.

Trump’s public musings on Russia also betray his unwillingness to take the strong steps that might persuade Putin to seriously negotiate. Last week, Trump characterized Russia and Ukraine as two brawling boys, rather than as aggressor and victim. This week, he [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG_JHaPMiZI)
 that he thought it strange that many American observers have a positive view of Japan and Germany, whom the United States fought in World War II, and a negative view of Russia, a US ally in that war—with no reference to Russia’s savage aggression in Ukraine or to the fact that Moscow considers the United States its principal adversary. 

As the latest two-week deadline passed this week with the Kremlin still firmly opposed to US peace proposals, Trump [commented](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/11/politics/trump-unresolved-foreign-conflicts)
 that Putin does not care about the human costs of war, but added that he was frustrated by both Russia and Ukraine.

While the president postures inconsistently, his administration is making decisions that disadvantage Ukraine. A case in point is the Defense Department’s decision to [divert](https://www.twz.com/news-features/counter-drone-weapons-diverted-from-ukraine-to-middle-east-amid-rising-tensions-hegseth-confirms)
 US counter-drone weapons from Ukraine to the Middle East. This decision was likely not taken with the goal of weakening Ukraine, but that was certainly the result. Such a decision can only be taken because the administration is not operating on the common-sense understanding that if it wants a durable peace in Ukraine, it must make it much harder for Putin to seize more of the country.

The Trump administration’s position in the preparation for the Group of Seven (G7) Summit in the coming days also highlights its peculiar interest in accommodating the Kremlin. The G7’s members have decided [not to release](https://www.npr.org/2025/06/12/nx-s1-5407560/trump-g7-canada)
 a joint communiqué, unlike last year, in part, I suspect, because previous G7 statements have included sharp criticism of Kremlin aggression. Herbst <image:9678>](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/trumps-russia-policy-must-be-rooted-in-realism/)

!Trump promised peace through strength. Taken together, these rhetorical and policy choices only encourage Russian President Vladimir Putin to continue his war of conquest and make it harder for Trump to reach his stated goal of establishing a durable peace in Ukraine.   

The painful reality is that the Kremlin does not want peace in Ukraine. The proof, of course, is that Russia has rejected multiple Trump peace proposals that Ukraine has accepted. Confronted by this, as early as April 24, Trump has acknowledged that Putin might be stalling and [said then](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/29/with-putin-trumps-decision-is-often-two-weeks-away-00374940)
, and again on April 27, that he would know in “two weeks” if that were so and, if so, he would put some form of pressure on Russia. 

Trump has been talking about a two-week deadline for nearly two months and has said on several occasions over this period that he might have to impose sanctions. The White House, meanwhile, has avoided language critical of the Kremlin since February in the G7, NATO, and the United Nations. 

Trump’s concessions to Russia on this language, his efforts to obscure the perception that Russia alone is blocking his peace initiative, and the decision to take weapons away from Ukraine have not made the Kremlin more reasonable. These measures only encourage Putin to expect that the United States will detach itself from Ukraine and that a Russian victory awaits. The Biden administration’s weakness in Afghanistan invited Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Trump promised peace through strength. When will he start to deliver?

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is not accurate. Evidence indicates that Olaf Scholz did not declare a state of emergency ("Notstand") in February 2025 due to Donald Trump's peace plan. Instead, Scholz referred to an urgent situation ("Notlage") and proposed declaring a state of emergency due to the war in Ukraine.

Furthermore, the evidence suggests that in August 2025, Friedrich Merz was the German Chancellor, not Olaf Scholz.

Five Minute News has episodes related to Donald Trump from August 2024, but none mention an interview with Theo Von or Keir Starmer ([https://fiveminute.news/cheer/episodes](https://fiveminute.news/cheer/episodes)). <image:5130>, <image:5131>


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the claim is false. A video of Trump criticizing Keir Starmer is circulating, but the audio is AI-generated and overlaid onto a video interview Trump did with Theo Von on August 21, 2024 ([https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/news/2025/hany-farid-discusses-circulating-trump-video-criticizing-keir-starmer](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/news/2025/hany-farid-discusses-circulating-trump-video-criticizing-keir-starmer)). The original interview did not discuss the UK or Ukraine.


## Final Judgement
The claim is demonstrably false. While Donald Trump did have an interview with Theo Von in August 2024, the audio criticizing Keir Starmer was AI-generated and overlaid onto the original interview. The original interview did not discuss the UK or Ukraine.

`false`


## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is false. An AI-generated audio clip of Donald Trump criticizing Keir Starmer was overlaid onto a real interview Trump did with Theo Von in August 2024, which did not discuss the UK or Ukraine, according to the University of California, Berkeley ([https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/news/2025/hany-farid-discusses-circulating-trump-video-criticizing-keir-starmer](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/news/2025/hany-farid-discusses-circulating-trump-video-criticizing-keir-starmer)).

"It is the latest in a long string of assertions by Russian officials, media, and the pro-Kremlin online ecosystem that Ukrainian officials are corrupt and use foreign aid money to enrich themselves." Léa Ronzaud, a senior investigator at research firm Graphika, told NPR in an email.

"It's just so typical of what we see from Russia, \[to\] take advantage of an ongoing crisis for their own ends," said Darren Linvill, a communications professor and co-director of Clemson University's Media Forensics Hub.

The Ukrainian general story first emerged on a pro-Russian Telegram channel four days after the fires started in Los Angeles. Some of the posts amplifying the baseless claim falsely credited it to United24 Media, a website affiliated with the Ukrainian government.

The Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council's Center for Countering Disinformation issued a [statement](https://x.com/CforCD/status/1878381491056501245)
 describing the claim as "Russian propaganda." It said it had verified with United24 Media that it did not create or share the story.

NPR has not obtained evidence that any Ukrainian generals owned homes in Los Angeles that were destroyed by the fires. Both @OlgaBazova and Patterson's posts received user-generated community notes on X citing the Greek fact check.

The unverified claim about the alleged Ukrainian-owned mansions also appeared on other social media platforms including Tik Tok, TruthSocial and the Russian site VK, but did not gain much traction.

The story is the latest example of Russia's shift away from using fake social media profiles impersonating real people, as it did during the 2016 and 2020 U.S. Accounts tied to previous China influence operations spread false claims about the fire's origins.

While the story about Ukrainian officials got more traction than the other narratives about the fires originating from Russia-allied channels, Linvill said, it has not yet spread as widely as previous narratives linked to Russia."

!Briefing Of The Commander-In-Chief Of The Armed Forces Of Ukraine Valerii Zaluzhnyi <image:2342>

General Valerii Zaluzhnyi was among those reported to have a home in Los Angeles, even though he lives in London now as Ukraine's ambassador to the UK. The Russian propaganda effort is thus to encourage support for the war at home while making those in the West question any aid that has been sent to Kyiv.

"People predisposed to believing narratives like this will take it to be another 'false' datapoint of corruption and largesse in the Ukrainian military, and at the same time, a sweet act of karma that these imaginary mansions are burning to the ground," said Schmidt. The total value of these properties amounts to $90 million and was allegedly purchased with funds provided by the West as part of economic aid to Kyiv after the war began."

Subsequent posts [named Valerii Zaluzhnyi](https://t.me/naspravdiinfo/104501 "https://t.me/naspravdiinfo/104501")
, former Ukrainian four-star general and current ambassador of Ukraine to the United Kingdom, as being among those who have lost their homes.

Satire, But Really Disinformation
---------------------------------

The initial post on Telegram did indeed include the hashtag "сатира" (Russian for satire), but subsequent reposts lacked any mention that it was made in jest. Yet, even as "satire," it isn't clear where the humor lies in the original post, except possibly to Russian audiences who might find joy that any Ukrainian would see their home burns down in the devastating California fires.

MORE FOR YOU

"There is zero evidence that any Ukrainian generals own any property in L.A., much less mansions," said Dr. It's not just about the misinformation – it's about how quickly it crosses platforms and gains traction."

Disinformation Fits An Existing Narrative
-----------------------------------------

All of these disinformation campaigns have a common thread – they're based on the unsubstantiated belief that Ukrainian officials are getting rich while the war continues. Matthew Schmidt, professor of national security and political science at the University of New Haven.

Humor likely wasn't even the point, and instead, the channels posting the claims likely wanted it to be believed as fact – much like the news last summer that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spent $15 million to [buy a Mercedes 770 automobile](https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2024/10/09/despite-online-claims-ukraines-zelensky-didnt-buy-hitlers-car/ "https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2024/10/09/despite-online-claims-ukraines-zelensky-didnt-buy-hitlers-car/")
 that was previously owned by Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler, or that Zelensky's wife purchased a [Bugatti sports car](https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2024/07/02/social-media-posts-claim-zelenskys-wife-spent-millions-on-bugatti-sportscar/ "https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2024/07/02/social-media-posts-claim-zelenskys-wife-spent-millions-on-bugatti-sportscar/")

The claim is part of a disinformation campaign based on the unsubstantiated belief that Ukrainian officials are getting rich while the war continues. NPR has not obtained evidence that any Ukrainian generals owned homes in Los Angeles that were destroyed by the fires.

A post [shared on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=3936628693283593&id=100008095036730)
 claims billionaire Elon Musk posted a “last dollar” for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

**Verdict: False**

There is no evidence that Musk posted this.

**Fact Check:**

Musk joined President-elect Donald Trump on his phone call with Zelenskyy, according to [The Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-ukraine-elon-musk-zelenskyy-starlink-f6ab0c5e1c5de1262ae2a1747247819c)
. Musk has become a part of Trump’s inner circle, the outlet reported.

Social media users are claiming that Musk posted that Zelenskyy had received his “last dollar.” These claims show an image of a purported tweet from Musk, which states, “The last dollar for Zelenskiy” and is accompanied by a dollar with Trump in the middle.

These claims are false. If he had done so, media outlets would have covered it, yet [none have](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=14c9acc35e76766d&q=musk+last+dollar+for+zelenskyy&tbm=nws&source=lnms&fbs=AEQNm0Aa4sjWe7Rqy32pFwRj0UkWtG_mNb-HwafvV8cKK_h1a5eSkyfXNgRC6a9SKsMT7FKel2oEVH7CAeL9GJLZ9zSE1b0VTwOacLkI4XgtHWeWNmKPMmJVT-fsL2j8HgVBOedFE0rcv3l9ce7iX7VQHiBT41qOitP2uFNPJwqo3Nj1J21-Gh5tg3bNyqf1kLEJ7mR0Orp4LTigYJIGRfW985SFZs7PWg&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjKqs7Mt9eJAxU8GFkFHTF9LuMQ0pQJegQIEhAB&biw=1440&bih=812&dpr=2)

From [Source](https://www.politico.eu/article/billionaire-elon-musk-mocks-ukraine-president-zelenskyy-asking-aid-with-meme/): 
Content: "[Skip to main content](#main)

Billionaire entrepreneur [Elon Musk mocked Ukraine’s war-time leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1708629197617336398)
 on Monday, using a meme to scoff at the president’s calls for Western aid.

“When it’s been 5 min and you haven’t asked for a billion dollars in aid,” read Musk’s message, which accompanied Zelenskyy’s head attached to a famous photo of an agitated schoolboy, who — according to the [meme’s etymology](https://medium.com/@tazreen.noman/the-origin-of-michael-mcgee-vein-popping-guy-ad41c63190f0)
 — was in a classroom and desperately trying to hold in flatulence.

Musk has had a troubled relationship with Ukrainians and the country’s administration since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion in February 2022, but now they’ve had just about enough of the SpaceX chief and owner of X (formerly Twitter).

“So you have bought social media to bully people who are dying because \[they\] love freedom,” Ukrainian stand-up comedian Anton Tymoshenko [wrote](https://twitter.com/_Tymoshenko/status/1708716338196214196)
 in response to Musk’s post.

“Elon, did you write this meme during a friendly conversation with Putin on the phone?” another Ukrainian comic and volunteer, Vasyl Baydak, [wrote](https://twitter.com/by_by_duck/status/1708711638268878922)
 — alluding to a [New Yorker report](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/08/28/elon-musks-shadow-rule)
 that Musk and the Russian president spoke directly.

Even Ukrainian media organizations joined the anti-Musk revolt, with top publication Ukrainska Pravda [posting](https://twitter.com/pravda_eng/status/1708732658182701406?s=20)
 the same meme, but with Musk’s face photoshopped in, saying: “When’s it’s been 5 minutes and you haven’t spread Russian propaganda.”

Zelenskyy has not yet reacted to Musk’s post. But that narrative flipped after he began spreading what Ukraine said was [pro-Russian propaganda](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/03/ukrainian-officials-and-allies-rail-against-elon-musk-tweet-00060085)
 via his social media.

According to a new biography of the tech boss, Musk also secretly ordered his engineers to [disable Starlink satellite](https://www.politico.eu/article/elon-musk-ukraine-starlink-russia-crimea-war-drone-submarine-attack-sabotage/)
 communications near the coast of Russian-occupied Crimea last year to sabotage a planned Ukrainian drone strike.

Last week, the [European Commission slammed Musk’s X](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_NCu44_Xc0)
 as the social media platform which is the biggest source of disinformation. President Joe Biden [signed](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/09/30/biden-administration-congress-government-shutdown-deal-ukraine-aid-00119296)
 a temporary budget bill featuring no Ukraine aid to avert the American government’s shutdown.

Shortly after Putin’s assault on Kyiv began last year, Musk was hailed in Ukraine thanks to his early decision to provide Starlink satellite internet for the country. But one of his office advisers, Serhiy Leshchenko, hit back [in a tweet](https://twitter.com/Leshchenkos/status/1708720295681421701)
 accusing Musk of “trolling.”

Musk’s meme comes shortly after U.S."

On October 2, 2023, more than a year before Donald Trump’s re-election, Elon Musk shared a meme on his social media platform X that mocked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, depicting him as a petulant teen. 

“When it’s been 5 minutes and you haven’t asked for a billion dollars in aid,” reads the text on the image, showing Zelensky looking sulky. 

The caricature is meant to mock Ukraine’s requests for financial assistance from the United States to help with the war in Ukraine, requests which Musk believes are too frequent and too demanding. 

 ![Légende: Above is a caricature of Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky created by a Russian propaganda agency. The image was [produced by](https://www.france.tv/france-2/complement-d-enquete/7065050-guerres-de-propagande-la-france-en-premiere-ligne.html)
 the Social Design Agency (SDA), a Russian agency that the Russian government pays to create influence operations and cause unrest, according to an investigation by [Complément d’Enquête](https://x.com/tristanwaleckx/status/1912803601694568795)
, a show on French television channel France 2. 

While there is no indication that SDA directed Musk to retweet the image, the fact that he did massively amplified the meme’s reach: it garnered more than 95 million views on his X account.  

To study Musk’s messaging on X, teams from the FRANCE 24 Observers, French media outlet France Info, and Belgian media outlet RTBF analysed around 15,000 posts shared by Elon Musk between November 4, 2024, and April 4, 2025, as part of a project through the Public French-speaking Media association ([Médias Francophones Publics](https://www.lesmediasfrancophones.org/)
).  

In order to analyse all of these tweets, we created a computer program based on ChatGPT’s artificial intelligence (see the sidebar at the end of the article). 

This enabled us to identify the hundreds of tweets that make up Elon Musk's anti-Ukraine rhetoric. Shortly after, Russian President Vladimir Putin threatened to use nuclear weapons if Ukraine hit Russia with long-range missiles

For his part, Musk expressed himself on X on [November 19](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1858873944327020864)
 ([archive](https://archive.ph/15B8C)
), approving the reactions of American political figures who were criticising the supply of missiles, such as those of Republican Ohio Senator Bernie Moreno who said that “Biden dramatically escalated the war” and Donald Trump Junior who wrote that “the American people want peace, not endless war!” In the days around November 17, Musk published 27 posts supporting Russia or criticising Ukraine. 

 ![This graph shows Musk’s tweets that are either pro-Russia or hostile to Ukraine that he posted between November 2024 and April 2025.](https://s.france24.com/media/display/c6b274e0-2515-11f0-987e-005056bfb2b6/w:980/graph-1-EN.png)

This graph shows Musk’s tweets that are either pro-Russia or hostile to Ukraine that he posted between November 2024 and April 2025. The meeting ended in a clash, with the Americans claiming that Zelensky wasn’t showing enough gratitude for the US aid provided to Ukraine.  

Musk published 138 posts related to this turbulent visit, sharing the highlights (or in this case lowlights) of the clash along with commentary, including when Zelensky’s [choice of clothing](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1895524314797220118)
 ([archive](https://archive.ph/jc3DQ)
) was criticised, when [Trump](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1895532321450967266)
 ([archive](https://archive.ph/xFtOW)
) claimed Zelensky was “gambling with World War III”, when Vance told Zelensky he was being disrespectful and when Republican Senator [Lindsay Graham](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1895582702923067837)
 ([archive](https://archive.ph/qMzxc)
) called for Zelensky to step down after the visit. © X / @elonmusk, FRANCE 24 Observers, MFP

Many of Musk’s posts directly criticise Zelensky.

”Elon Musk is picking up Putin’s narrative against the Ukrainian president,” says Jérôme Viala-Gaudefroy, who has a doctorate in American civilisation and wrote the book “Trump’s words” ("Les mots de Trump" published by Dalloz.). Sack joined the Trump administration last December to work on issues relating to artificial intelligence and crypto money. 

Musk is also in contact with figures reputed to have close connections with Russia like Mario Nawfal, a Lebanese-Australian influencer who is known for having interviewed Belarusian President [Alexander Lukachenko](https://x.com/AmbassadeBLR/status/1897202102830518722/)
, a close Putin ally, and Ian Miles Cheong, a Malaysian influencer who used to write for [Russia Today](https://time.com/6694681/ian-miles-cheong-malaysia-execution-internet-trending-israel/)
.

“Elon Musk doesn’t explicitly boost pro-Kremlin accounts,” Jessica Yarin Robinson explains. Thank you, [@KGawkowski](https://x.com/KGawkowski)
 \[Editor’s note: Krzysztof Gawkowski, the Polish minister of digital affairs\] and Poland,” Musk tweeted, clearly pleased to have patched things up with his clients. 

_To study Musk’s messaging on X, teams from the France 24 Observers and Belgian broadcaster RTBF analysed and categorised more than 15,000 tweets and retweets shared by his account (@elonmusk) between November 4, 2024 and April 4, 2025._ 

_In order to analyse all of these tweets, we used a method created by researchers in cognitive science at the French higher education institute l__'É__cole Normale supérieure (for more on the method click_ [_here_](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/artificial-intelligence/articles/10.3389/frai.2024.1365508/full)
_), which allowed us to catagorise text using the ChatGPT language model._

_We asked ChatGPT’s API to categorise each tweet, which enabled us to identify all of the tweets that Musk shared that were either hostile to Ukraine or favorable to Russia, as well as those that criticised Europe and those that showed support for the European far right._ 

_We verified the results by manually analysing each post._  

_We examined Musk’s original posts, as well as the posts he shared (such as his retweets or quote tweets). We also included the transcripts of videos that he posted directly or shared from other accounts._

_You can find our complete methodology [here](https://cryptpad.fr/pad/#/2/pad/view/71nytWI873B7tpZUsmuLEuMJoC7XfSqWhhaF9Z8Bezg/embed/)

In order to find evidence that helps your fact-check, you just ran a web search which yielded a Search Result. **Your task right now is to summarize the Search Result.** What to include:
* information that might be useful for the fact-check (see Record)
* relevant images (refer to images by inserting their reference <image:k>)
* if available: the release date as well as the author or the publisher (e.g. the media company) of the search result.

Do NOT include:
* advertisements
* any other information not related to the Record or the Claim

Additional rules:
* Do not add any additional information besides the information in the Search Result.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

US President Donald Trump is focused on peace and has made unprecedented progress in the negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, US Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard told NDTV in an exclusive conversation today.

Here are the top 10 quotes by Tulsi Gabbard:
--------------------------------------------

1. "Trump remains very committed to combating and defeating the threat of Islamist terrorism. "Trump is also taking action where the previous administration failed. So, President Trump has taken a decisive action for our own safety, security, and prosperity."
    

8. "President Trump is seeing this ongoing conflict with very clear eyes. "Under the previous administration, there was no effort at all towards peace or direct dialogue with Putin to bring an end to this war. So, in a very short period of time, Trump has made much more progress towards peace than any other previous effort. The talks are just beginning between Trump's incoming cabinet and the Bangladesh government, but this continues to remain a central focus area of concern."

CNN  — 

Vice President JD Vance warned on Thursday that the United States could hit Russia with economic and military “tools of leverage” if Russian leader Vladimir Putin doesn’t negotiate a peace deal with Ukraine in good faith.

Speaking to the Wall Street Journal on Thursday, Vance said the option of sending US troops to Ukraine was “on the table,” as well as economic punishment if a peace deal doesn’t guarantee Kyiv’s long-term independence.

“There are economic tools of leverage, there are of course military tools of leverage,” Vance told the newspaper.

His comments strike a different tone from other recent statements from the White House – including from US President Donald Trump who [suggested this week](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/11/europe/ukraine-russia-trump-zelensky-intl/index.html)
 that Ukraine “may be Russian someday,” shortly before announcing that peace negotiations would begin immediately after holding a phone call with Putin.

Vance’s statement also contrasts with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who has said the US would no longer prioritize European and Ukrainian security. (AP Photo/Alex Babenko)\

The Wall Street Journal interview was published before Vance was set to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the high-level Munich Security Conference in Germany.

On arrival in Munich Vance said NATO remains an important alliance for the United States.

“Europe is of course a very important ally to the United States, NATO is a very important military alliance … but we want to make sure NATO is actually built for the future, and part of that is ensuring that NATO does a little bit more burden-sharing in Europe so the United States can focus on some of our challenges in East Asia,” Vance said, speaking to reporters beside NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte.

An air of uncertainty and anxiety that has enveloped Europe in the past week, after Trump’s announcement [sparked fears that a “dirty deal”](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/13/europe/europe-dirty-deal-trump-putin-ukraine-deal-intl/index.html)
 may be struck with Putin to end the war on terms favorable to Moscow without Kyiv’s involvement.

Many in Europe were shocked Trump appeared to make key concessions to Moscow before even agreeing to peace talks. [](#maincontent)

Volodymyr Zelenskyy, president of Ukraine speaks to the press during a media briefing on the territory of Khmelnytskyi Nuclear Power Plant, Ukraine, Thursday, Feb. This week, he told NATO allies that European and non-European troops – but not Americans – would have to police any agreement between Ukraine and Russia.

CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.

[![Volodymyr Zelenskyy, president of Ukraine speaks to the press during a media briefing on the territory of Khmelnytskyi Nuclear Power Plant, Ukraine, Thursday, Feb. His and Hegseth’s comments also threw into question the future of NATO’s future unity, resources and funding, a cornerstone of European security since the Second World War.

There was also surprise that Trump spoke to Putin before speaking to Zelensky, with European leaders on Thursday scrambling to make clear any peace deal would have to involve Ukraine at the heart of negotiations.

After Trump’s announcement of the peace deal negotiations, French President Emmanuel Macron also described his return to the White House as an “electroshock” for Europe in an interview with the Financial Times.

Macron underlined the need for Europe to strengthen its economy and defenses, agreeing with Trump’s stance that Ukraine’s security was a European responsibility. 13, 2025. 13, 2025. But he also emphasized that only Ukraine could negotiate for itself, and that any peace that was a “capitulation” would be bad news for everyone.

U.S. Vice President JD Vance visits Dachau Concentration Camp Memorial Site in Dachau, Germany February 13, 2025. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told [Ukraine's military allies](/world/europe/us-defense-chief-hegseth-says-return-ukraines-pre-2014-borders-not-realistic-2025-02-12/)

Vance also agreed that Trump might change his mind depending on how the negotiations unfold.

“President Trump could say, look, we don’t want this thing, we might not like this thing, but we’re willing to put it back on the table if the Russians aren’t being good negotiating partners, or there are things that are very important to Ukrainians that we might want to take off the table,” he said.

Feb 13 (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President JD Vance said the U.S. does not see NATO membership for Kyiv as part of a solution.

Ukrainians on Thursday worried that Trump was preparing to sell out their country following his phone call Putin.

Earlier in the day, Trump said that Ukraine would be involved in [peace talks with Russia](/world/eu-warns-against-dirty-deal-ukraine-after-trump-putin-phone-call-2025-02-13/)
. He told reporters at the White House that Ukraine would have a seat at the table during any peace negotiations with Russia over ending the war.

Kyiv said it would be premature to speak with Moscow at a security conference on Friday.

“I think there is a deal that is going to come out of this that’s going to shock a lot of people,” the newspaper quoted Vance as saying.

"The president is not going to go in this with blinders on,” Vance said."

### TEHRAN (Tasnim) - Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova commented on reports that hundreds of prisoners have been mobilized to extinguish fires in the US state of California, pointing to the hypocrisy of the US.

[\- Other Media news -](/en/service/1200/other-media)

Earlier, The Washington Post, citing the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, reported that the state authorities had sent 395 prisoners to fight forest fires. The diplomat noted that in 2023, Washington restricted imports of products from several Chinese companies in an attempt to exclude goods allegedly produced with the help of Uygur forced labor from the US supply chain.

"This raises a logical question: will Congress draft a bill imposing sanctions on California authorities, private companies, and ordinary Americans for using prison labor to put out fires?" she wondered. "We are so sick of this hypocrisy!" Zakharova added.

Wildfires began to spread across Los Angeles County on January 7."

Did Russia offer sanctuary to California residents who lost their homes in the Los Angeles fires? A viral X [post](https://x.com/jacksonhinklle/status/1879042008465183185)
 by Jackson Hinkle—a [regular purveyor](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/11/business/media/jackson-hinkle-israel-gaza-misinformation.html)
 of Russia-related misinformation—claims so.

“BREAKING: RUSSIA has offered shelter & sanctuary to Californians whose livelihoods were DESTROYED in the LA wildfires,” reads the post, which had more than 500,000 views on X as of January 15.

Assessing Claims That Russia Offered Sanctuary to California Fire Victims
=========================================================================

One Russian governor did make an offer, but there are some caveats.

! A single Russian governor said that he would welcome California fire victims to the region of occupied Ukraine he oversees, but only if they don’t support the government in Kyiv.

On Monday, Vladimir Saldo, the governor of the Russian-occupied Kherson oblast region of Ukraine, [told](https://tass.ru/obschestvo/22867057)
 _TASS_—a Russian state-controlled media outlet—that the region would accept any Americans who lost their homes in this month’s California fires. “Despite the ongoing, blatantly anti-Russian policy of the United States, we fully understand that natural disasters don’t care who you are or what you do,” Saldo said, [according to](https://www.rt.com/russia/610836-california-fires-sanctuary-kherson/)
 Russia Today, a Russian state-controlled network that translated the statement into English. Therefore, our region is ready to welcome any American citizen who has lost their home and livelihood.”

That offer comes with a caveat, applying only to Californians who haven’t supported Ukraine since Russia invaded its borders in February 2022. Sutton")

Other Russian Telegram channels are also spreading false or unverified narratives about the southern California fires and the government's response, as well as amplifying critiques from Americans including the president-elect's son, Donald Trump, Jr., Andy Carvin of the Atlantic Council's DFRLab told NPR in an email. The Russian news site [Pravda](https://web.archive.org/web/20250115205032/https://news-pravda.com/world/2025/01/08/963104.html)
, which has been associated with prior Russian information operations, then translates and distributes the Telegram posts.

"Over the last week, Pravda has published at least 350 stories of this type \[based on Telegram messages about the fires\], based on our initial content analysis of the site," Carvin said.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that Russia commented on the California wildfires in January 2025. Maria Zakharova made comments, and Vladimir Saldo offered sanctuary to fire victims. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Russia offered assistance for the wildfires. The NPR article mentions that pro-Kremlin social media accounts spread a false narrative about the wildfires.

Therefore, the claim is not directly supported by the evidence. The evidence suggests that Russia was involved in the discussion and offered sanctuary, but not assistance.

To verify the claim, information about any specific offers of assistance from Russia is missing.

Last week, devastating wildfires ignited across Los Angeles County in what is one of the most destructive natural disasters in US history. But as firefighters continue to battle the flames, false and misleading information about the disaster [has spread](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/10/rightwing-misinformation-los-angeles-fire)
 just as quickly on social media. While much of the false information seemingly originated from users in the United States, Russian state-affiliated accounts also leveraged the California wildfires and narratives reverberating among certain segments of the US public to sow division, undermine trust in relief efforts, and reduce public support for Ukraine.  

**Diverting Resources to Ukraine** 

Amid the destructive wildfires in Los Angeles, Russian government officials and state-affiliated media have propagated narratives critical of the Biden administration and other Democratic leaders to aggravate political division, particularly on Ukraine, and to denigrate the United States. Russian-state controlled outlet Sputnik further [mocked](https://x.com/Sputnik_India/status/1879127371049001320)
 Biden’s emergency relief payments to victims of the wildfires, claiming that they receive less daily per capita than people in Ukraine and Israel.  

Russian state-controlled media outlets further [honed in](https://sputnikglobe.com/20250109/california-wildfires-unexpected-links-to-us-green-lobby-and-ukraine-1121391704.html)
 [on reports](https://x.com/SputnikInt/status/1877282105815597399)
 that the Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) donated surplus equipment to Ukraine in 2022 [to suggest](https://x.com/SputnikInt/status/1877345987468882396)
 that those donations [created a lack of](https://x.com/RT_com/status/1877126472915128820)
 resources to fight fires. Additionally, Russian state media seized on the fires to fuel divides on other partisan policy issues, linking the fires to the “[green lobby](https://sputnikglobe.com/20250109/california-wildfires-unexpected-links-to-us-green-lobby-and-ukraine-1121391704.html)
” and [blaming](https://x.com/RT_com/status/1877151147703562608)
 the firefighter shortage on COVID-19 vaccine mandates.

**Amplifying** **AI-Generated Content**

In at least one case, Russian state media amplified a misleading image generated by artificial intelligence (AI). Other Russian-language media outlets subsequently spread the image. 

**Conclusion** 

Kremlin-affiliated accounts have leveraged the California wildfires to further advance Russia’s geopolitical agenda. In a press conference on January 14, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov [claimed](https://x.com/SputnikInt/status/1879100711361016212)
 the estimated $250 billion worth of damage sustained from the California fires is comparable to the amount Washington “pumped into Ukraine”. Russia’s messaging on the wildfires further underlines a trend of autocratic states [exploiting natural disasters](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/investigations/russia-china-cuba-amplified-falsehoods-recent-hurricanes-us-official-s-rcna177672)
 to advance their geopolitical goals. This approach keeps with Russia’s now [longstanding strategy](https://securingdemocracy.gmfus.org/a-year-of-disinformation-russia-and-chinas-influence-campaigns-during-the-war-in-ukraine/)
 to dent US support for Ukraine by playing to pocketbook issues and perceptions that domestic issues have received less attention than foreign ones. 

![](/sites/default/files/inline-images/rt%201.png)

**Blaming DEI**

Accounts affiliated with Russia echoed narratives prominent among American audiences that claim diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives hindered wildfire recovery efforts. Russian state-controlled media outlet RT [accused](https://x.com/RT_com/status/1876870822637248582)
 LAFD Chief Kristen Crowly—the first woman and openly gay person to serve in the role—of prioritizing DEI initiatives at the expense of preventing fires. Sputnik also [posted](https://x.com/SputnikInt/status/1877278684240859332)
 a local news clip of a California resident who claimed that “gay people” were the cause of the fires."

MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:

And now to California, where firefighters in Los Angeles are making progress getting those massive wildfires under control. Now, NPR has learned that Russia is using the fires to advance anti-Ukraine propaganda as part of its war against that country. So far, there's no evidence that it happened, and the Ukrainian government has denied it to NPR, but researchers say that it is part of a bigger narrative that Russia has pushed for years. Pro-Russian accounts regularly claim that various Ukrainian officials own luxury goods overseas, like yachts, villas and, in one case, a sports car. The underlying idea is that Ukrainian government is corrupt and does not deserve foreign aid, which it is currently receiving for its war with Russia. How did it spread?

HUO: So fact-checkers traced this narrative to pro-Russian Telegram channels. A lot of these accounts and websites have a history of either being a part of or echoing known Russian-influenced operations. Darren Linvill is a professor at Clemson University and codirects its media forensics lab.

DARREN LINVILL: It's just so typical of what we see from Russia and so despicable to take advantage of an ongoing crisis for their own ends.

HUO: You know, aside from undermining Ukraine, Russia also wants to sow internal discord in the United States. We see this both in this disaster and in the Maui fires in 2023.

KELLY: Yeah.

HUO: Russian state media amplified American - often conservative - voices criticizing the government's disaster response. This didn't get much traction, though.

KELLY: And this specific false claim - has it gotten much traction - traveled very far?

HUO: So it's gotten a million views on X with help from one pro-Russian influencer and then an American influencer."

Jan. "It's just so typical of what we see from Russia, \[to\] take advantage of an ongoing crisis for their own ends," said Darren Linvill, a communications professor and co-director of Clemson University's Media Forensics Hub.

The story that initially circulated was debunked by professional fact checkers from [Greece](https://www.factchecker.gr/2025/01/12/russian-propaganda-8-mansions-of-high-ranking-ukrainian-military-officials-did-not-burn-down-in-los-angeles/)
 and the [United States](https://www.snopes.com/news/2025/01/13/wildfires-ukraine-mansions/)
. The influencers have said they did not know the company paying them was linked to Russia.

Other Russian Telegram channels are also spreading false or unverified narratives about the southern California fires and the government’s response, as well as amplifying critiques from Americans including the president-elect’s son, Donald Trump, Jr., Andy Carvin of the Atlantic Council’s DFRLab told NPR in an email. Pro-Kremlin social media accounts have spread baseless claims that Ukrainian military officials owned mansions that were destroyed in the fires that swept the Los Angeles region.

Pro-Kremlin social media accounts and outlets have been spreading a [baseless narrative](https://www.snopes.com/news/2025/01/13/wildfires-ukraine-mansions/)
 that mansions belonging to Ukrainian military officers burned down [in the Los Angeles wildfires](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/15/nx-s1-5260939/fires-los-angeles-palisades-eaton-wildfires-winds)
. Researchers who study Russian influence operations say it is part of the Kremlin’s larger campaign to discredit the Ukrainian government and [undermine U.S. support for Ukraine](https://www.npr.org/2024/06/06/g-s1-2965/russia-propaganda-deepfakes-sham-websites-social-media-ukraine)
.

“It is the latest in a long string of assertions by Russian officials, media, and the pro-Kremlin online ecosystem that Ukrainian officials are corrupt and use foreign aid money to enrich themselves.” Léa Ronzaud, a senior investigator at research firm Graphika, told NPR in an email.

“It’s just so typical of what we see from Russia, \[to\] take advantage of an ongoing crisis for their own ends,” said Darren Linvill, a communications professor and co-director of Clemson University’s Media Forensics Hub.

The Ukrainian general story first emerged on a pro-Russian Telegram channel four days after the fires started in Los Angeles. Within hours, it was amplified by several other sources, including another Telegram channel which labeled it as satire, an X account, and a website that resembles a [pro-Russian network](https://www.sgdsn.gouv.fr/files/files/20240212_NP_SGDSN_VIGINUM_PORTAL-KOMBAT-NETWORK_ENG_VF.pdf)
 that French authorities previously identified. Some of the posts amplifying the baseless claim falsely credited it to United24 Media, a website affiliated with the Ukrainian government.

The Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council’s Center for Countering Disinformation issued a [statement](https://x.com/CforCD/status/1878381491056501245)
 describing the claim as “Russian propaganda.” It said it had verified with United24 Media that it did not create or share the story.

NPR has not obtained evidence that any Ukrainian generals owned homes in Los Angeles that were destroyed by the fires. The Ukrainian government denied to NPR that any general’s homes were affected by the fire.

The next day, an influencer using the handle @OlgaBazova, who has previously echoed narratives pushed by known Russian influence networks, [shared the story](https://archive.ph/wZHZb)
 in English with its 700,000 followers on X. The account’s bio describes itself as “specializing in humoristic geopolitical analytics, exposing hypocrisy and satire.”

Later in the evening, Robert “Buzz” Patterson, an American conservative influencer with 400,000 followers on X, [repeated the claim](https://archive.ph/2BL9c)
, seemingly without irony, in a post that has been viewed over a million times, according to X’s data.

THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR:

[Become a Sponsor](https://www.opb.org/sponsorship/)

When contacted by NPR on X about the post, @OlgaBazova responded with a link to a Russian-language article that cited the original Telegram claim about the mansions.

Patterson did not respond to messages from NPR asking why he had posted the claim.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The new evidence reinforces the previous findings. It highlights that Russia leveraged the California wildfires to sow division and spread anti-Ukraine propaganda. However, the evidence still does not mention any offers of assistance from Russia.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified. The evidence focuses on Russia's use of the wildfires for propaganda purposes, not on providing aid.

Russia exploits wildfires in Los Angeles to push anti-US, anti-Ukraine propaganda

Russia exploits wildfires in Los Angeles to push anti-US, anti-Ukraine propaganda

#### Maria Zakharova

Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman

U.S. uses forced labor by involving inmates in fighting Los Angeles fires, while sanctioning China for using forced labor in Xinjiang.

[Source: RIA Novosti, January 12, 2025](https://ria.ru/20250112/zaharova-1993301092.html "Source: RIA Novosti, January 12, 2025")

False

Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova accused the United States of “obscurantist hypocrisy” for allowing inmates to fight Los Angeles wildfires. has been condemning for years.

"Hundreds of prisoners have been recruited to fight wildfires in southern California … In recent years, U.S. officials have repeatedly criticized China for using forced labor, especially in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region … \[W\]ill Congress impose sanctions on the California government, private companies, and ordinary Americans for using prison labor to fight fires."

The claim is false.

[In California, inmates voluntarily join firefighting crews](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/10/nx-s1-5254122/inmate-firefighters-california-wildfires)
 if they meet the program’s qualifications, which consider physical fitness and behavioral records. government is impoverishing its own citizens.

Speaking at a January 14 press conference on the results of Russian diplomacy in 2024, Lavrov said, that Americans “burned almost all of California,” and the damage is estimated $250 billion, which is “comparable” to what the U.S. pledged to [Ukraine](https://www.state.gov/bureau-of-political-military-affairs/releases/2025/01/u-s-security-cooperation-with-ukraine)
 about $66.2 billion in [security assistance](https://media.defense.gov/2025/Jan/09/2003626079/-1/-1/1/KEY-ACHIEVEMENTS-AND-FACTS-US-SECURITY-ASSISTANCE-TO-UKRAINE.PDF)
 between 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea, and February 2022 when Moscow launched a war, and about $66.5 billion since.

Lavrov’s claim that by aiding Ukraine the U.S. society, in part due to the [Russian propaganda influence](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/07/nx-s1-5101895/doj-says-russia-paid-right-wing-influencers-to-spread-russian-propaganda)
.

Experts, however, argue that opposite to draining American economy, the large portion of the Ukraine aid is being reinvested domestically, [boosting defense manufacturing industry and sustaining jobs](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/blog-post/us-aid-ukraine-helps-american-economy-and-boosts-us-jobs)
.

Russian propaganda exploited the Ukrainian angle in the Los Angeles fires trying to spread false accusations against Ukraine’s military command of misappropriating the Western aid.

Russia’s newly emerged group of social media influencers nicknamed “milbloggers” as most members are either Russian combatants or pro-war reporters from the battle lines in Ukraine, played key role in creating and spreading such false claims.

Russian Telegram channel Voennyj obozrevatel' (Military Observer) alleged on January 11, that eight mansions worth a total of $90 million owned by high-ranking Ukrainian military officials, were destroyed in the Los Angeles wildfires.

“According to Ukrainian sources, 8 mansions owned by high-ranking Ukrainian military personnel were burned during large-scale wildfires in Los Angeles. The total value of these properties amounts to $90 million and was allegedly purchased with funds provided by the West as part of economic aid to Kyiv after the war began.”

Russian state-controlled news sites and media outlets, including Gazeta.ru, Lenta.ru, EADaily, News.ru, Komsomolskaya Pravda, Tsargrad, and Rossiyskaya Gazeta used the post in their news coverage.

[Multiple fact-checking outlets](https://www.factchecker.gr/2025/01/12/russian-propaganda-8-mansions-of-high-ranking-ukrainian-military-officials-did-not-burn-down-in-los-angeles/)
 and even some Russian news media debunked the post as lacking merit and unsubstantiated.

Yet the claim about the luxury villas of Ukrainian generals allegedly burning down in Los Angeles spread on X the following days, receiving millions of views and thousands of reposts.

In another disinformation plot, on January 13-14, Russian state-owned news sites sought to undermine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's decision to send Ukrainian firefighters to Los Angeles to help put out the wildfires.

State-owned RIA Novosti, RT, and others used an X post by “Ukrainian journalist” Diana Panchenko, who wrote responding to Zeleskyy’s announcement: "I am glad that hundreds of men will have the opportunity to leave Ukraine these days."

Russian news outlets generalized the post, speculating it signaled that Ukrainian journalists oppose Ukraine's fight for independence and the Ukrainian men are desperate to leave the country.

In fact, Reporters Without Borders exposed [Diana Panchenko as Russian propagandist](https://rsf.org/en/diana-panchenko-ukrainian-propagandist-working-kremlin)
 working for the Kremlin. <image:2557>

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Russia commented on the California wildfires in January 2025. Maria Zakharova made comments, and Vladimir Saldo offered sanctuary to fire victims. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Russia offered assistance for the wildfires. The NPR article mentions that pro-Kremlin social media accounts spread a false narrative about the wildfires.

Therefore, the claim is not directly supported by the evidence. The evidence suggests that Russia was involved in the discussion and offered sanctuary, but not assistance.

To verify the claim, information about any specific offers of assistance from Russia is missing.

Experts told _Newsweek_ that, even if an American PMC were operational in Kursk, it would not equate to Ukraine's raid being conducted under the direction or patronage of the Biden administration, as alleged by the Foreign Ministry.

Helene Olsen, a lecturer in defense studies at King's College London and an expert in the usa of mercenaries and other forms of private contractors in conflict, told _Newsweek_ that it is in the nature of PMCs to "go where the money is."

"While American PMCs traditionally have worked closely with the US Gov and many American PMCs have interests that align with the US Gov, PMCs, irrespective of origin, are ultimately businesses," Olsen said, adding that Russia "would benefit from making up these allegations considering the stigma connected with the private military industry."

According to a release on its website, the ministry expressed its "strong protest" to Holmes "in connection with provocative actions of American reporters who illegally infiltrated Kursk Oblast for propagandist reporting of crimes of Kyiv's regime."

The ministry also claimed to have seen evidence "of the participation of an American \[private military company\] on the side of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the invasion of the territory of the Russian Federation."

According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, however, the involvement of an American PMC in these operations ran "counter to the Biden administration's assertions that it was allegedly not involved in the attack by Ukrainian neo-Nazis on Russia" and that this proved "the United States, as a direct participant in the conflict, is involved in Vladimir Zelensky's malicious plans."

The ministry went on to say that an investigation would be launched into the "American citizens involved in these crimes." It added that those who cross over into Russian territory "automatically become a legitimate military target for the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation."

"Russia has repeatedly stated [NATO](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/nato)

*   Russian Foreign Ministry summons US Charge d'affaires in Moscow Stephanie Holmes to convey strong protest against 'provocative actions of American reporters' and 'participation of the American PMCs'   

**MOSCOW** 

Russia protested on Tuesday that US private military companies (PMCs) are fighting alongside Ukraine in the Kursk region, while reporters from several major American media outlets illegally entered Russian territory to cover the incursion. 

The Russian Foreign Ministry claimed in a statement that soldiers from US private military companies are fighting alongside Ukrainian troops in the Kursk region, and journalists illegally entered Russian territory to cover the incursion.

US Charge d'affaires Stephanie Holmes was summoned to the Foreign Ministry in Moscow to convey strong protest against the "provocative actions of American reporters" and "participation of the American PMCs on the side of Ukraine's armed forces during their invasion" of Russia, it said.

"Such actions are contradicting statements by Joe Biden administration about non-involvement in Ukraine's neo-Nazi attack against Russia, proving with all clarity US involvement as a direct participant of the conflict in (Ukraine's President Volodymyr) Zelenskyy's malicious intentions," the ministry stressed.

The ministry warned that Russian law enforcement will investigate US citizens’ actions and take necessary measures to bring them to justice.

"All foreign 'specialists' and mercenaries illegally crossing the border of our country automatically become a legitimate military target for the armed forces of the Russian Federation," it said.

Kyiv's incursion into the Kursk region began on the night of August 5-6, when Ukrainian forces entered near Sudzha. **Please contact us for subscription options.**](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/p/subscription/1001)

При [бегстве из Балаклеи](https://apostrophe.ua/news/society/2022-09-08/v-balaklee-i-okrestnyih-selah-podnyali-ukrainskie-flagi-foto-i-video/278860)
 в Харьковской области российские оккупанты потеряли очень много живой силы и техники.

Подробности феерического отступления россиян появляются в сети.

Украинский журналист Денис Казанский [опубликовал](https://t.me/kazansky2017/3989)
 красноречивое фото, на котором два бойца ВСУ "селфятся" на фоне лежащего на земле "орка".

"_Теперь уже можно! Балаклея - это Украина!_", - подписан кадр.

Кроме того, в Балаклее у оккупантов очень большие потери. Россияне драпали так быстро, что [бросали](https://t.me/kazansky2017/3991?single)
 тела погибших сослуживцев.

Разгром российской армии в Балаклее стал расплатой за Иловайск в 2014 году, [отмечает](https://t.me/kazansky2017/3994)
 журналист, добавляя, что на дорогах в округе повсюду разбитая и брошенная техника оккупантов.

Еще один украинский журналист Анатолий Цаплиенко [сообщает](https://t.me/Tsaplienko/15021)
, что россияне пробовали убежать, но на дороге их встретила засада украинских бойцов. Чем все закончилось, можно посмотреть на видео.

Напомним, Президент Украины [Владимир Зеленский официально подтвердил освобождение города Балаклеи в Харьковской области от российских оккупантов](https://apostrophe.ua/news/society/2022-09-08/teper-ofitsialno-zelenskiy-podtverdil-osvobojdenie-balaklei-ot-okkupantov/278876)

##### Президент Зеленский предположил, что война может завершиться в 2026 году. Верите ли вы в это?

Да, это возможно

Нет, сомневаюсь

!Оккупанты понесли огромные потери при паническом бегстве из Балаклеи <image:2752>

Многие российские военные попали в засаду.

При бегстве из Балаклеи в Харьковской области российские оккупанты потеряли очень много живой силы и техники.

Подробности феерического отступления россиян появляются в сети, сообщает [«Апостроф»](https://apostrophe.ua/news/society/2022-09-08/rasplata-za-ilovaysk-okkupantyi-ponesli-ogromnyie-poteri-pri-begstve-iz-balaklei-video/278880/)

Российские войска отступают. Как развивается украинское контрнаступление и чем успехи ВСУ последних недель грозят России — мнение экспертов и российских военных

Украина [объявила](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1018539645523163)
 о контрнаступлении на юге страны в Херсонской области 29 августа, а 6 сентября начала наступательную операцию на востоке — в Харьковской области. За это время украинская армия освободила десятки населенных пунктов и продвинулась вглубь российских оборонительных позиций. Поступают сообщения о том, что российские войска отступают из стратегически важных городов — Балаклеи, Купянска, Изюма, Волчанска и Лимана. Военные эксперты называют события последних двух недель невообразимым [успехом](https://republic.ru/posts/105163)

### **Российские войска не могут держать оборону и бегут**

«8 лет говорили что и когда будут делать: один треп, обо всем со всех щелей. Никакой тактики, никакого профессионализма, никакого ума. Когда на это \[контрнаступление ВСУ\] смотрим мы \[военные\], мы понимаем, что изначально все было сделано неправильно. Но забили на это хуй, начали двигаться дальше криво, коряво. А с другой \[украинской\] стороны, люди просто взяли, увидели это, соорганизовались, все сделали. ‎

Поэтому в плане войны все выглядит очень логично: мы начали как долбоебы, не смогли ничего удержать, всё разъебали, один сплошной пиздеж вокруг, командования ноль, обеспечения ноль, руководства ноль. И вот изначально было понятно, что будет заканчиваться тем, что нас просто разнесут», — комментирует «‎Важным историям»‎ ситуацию на фронте бывший российский военнослужащий, который участвовал в войне в Украине. «Вспоминаю, как долго \[ВС РФ\] ковыряли Мариуполь и Северодонецк, а тут два дня \[понадобилось ВСУ\]. \[При том, что\] Изюм чуть ли не с первых дней войны был под контролем \[российских войск\], то есть они даже не планировали и не думали, что его, возможно, придется оборонять», — недоумевает другой бывший российский военный.

 отступление российских войск «операцией по свертыванию и переброске Изюмско-Балаклейской группировки» для наращивания усилий по «освобождению Донбасса».

«Сейчас мы видим, как российские войска бегут, потому что не могут держать оборону», — описывает происходящее украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. Этому предшествовал первый крупный успех ВСУ в Харьковской области — освобождение 8 сентября города Балаклея, который был оккупирован с марта. «Это место, где сосредоточены склады с боеприпасами для артиллерии, поэтому \[ее освобождение\] достаточно серьезно усилит огневые возможности ВСУ», — говорит военный эксперт.

Именно освобождение Балаклеи позволило ВСУ лишить российскую группировку, которая там сконцентрирована, возможности держать оборону, поскольку отрезало их от «логистической артерии» Волчанск-Большой Бурлук-Купянск-Изюм, по которой происходило снабжение армии, объясняет эксперт. «Без снабжения вся эта масса личного состава и техники, сконцентрированная на Изюмском направлении, оказалась бы не боеспособной», — говорит Коваленко.

По словам российского военного эксперта Юрия Федорова, у российских войск на этом направлении «очень крупные потери»: не только убитыми, но и пленными: «как минимум сотни пленных, если не пара тысяч».

Вероятное большое количество пленных подтверждают и двое бывших военнослужащих российской армии. «При спонтанном отступлении особенно много пленных. Связи внутри подразделений нет. Кто где находится, командиры не всегда знают. Соответственно, об отступлении не все могут знать», — говорят они. Бывший военнослужащий одного из элитных подразделений в разговоре с «Важными историями» отметил, что на Харьковском направлении обе стороны несут ощутимые потери. «Когда мои говорят: „Бля, там пиздец“, значит, что всё плохо», — добавил собеседник «Важных историй».

### **Почему провалилась российская оборона**

Несмотря на то, что в Харьковской области было сконцентрировано больше российских войск, чем задействовано сил ВСУ в контрнаступлении на этом участке, операция была направлена на особо уязвимые места, где возможности российских подразделений по обороне были истощены, говорит украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. «Российское командование знало, что у них есть уязвимые места в Харьковской области, они даже пытались их в значительной степени усилить. Знали, но предотвратить \[исход событий\] не могли: нехватка ресурсов уже начала сказываться на их возможностях по ведению обороны. И сейчас мы наблюдаем каскадный обвал обороны», — объясняет Александр Коваленко.

*   [ЗСУ вже на околицях окупованого Куп’янська](https://cripo.com.ua/news/war/zsu-vzhe-na-okolytsyah-okupovanogo-kup-yanska/ "Permalink to ЗСУ вже на околицях окупованого Куп’янська")
    

Российский военный эксперт Юрий Федоров говорит, что в Харьковской области украинская армия использовала новую тактику, которая и обеспечила успех на этом направлении. «ВСУ действуют очень динамично и фактически не задерживаются на то, чтобы штурмовать те или иные города. Они просто их обходят, берут в кольцо, и тогда гарнизоны этих городков и небольших сел просто вынуждены капитулировать, — рассказывает российский военный эксперт Юрий Федоров.

— Сейчас уже практически взят Купянск, по крайней мере, та часть, которая находится на правом берегу. Сдан Изюм или находится в процессе. Российские войска уходят оттуда, чтобы не попасть в окружение. Это, в общем, разумное решение, потому что коммуникации перерезаны. Сам по себе Изюм находится на стыке двух рек: Оскол и Северский Донец. Если его окружить, скажем, с северо-востока или с севера, то он просто будет отрезан от подвоза боеприпасов и всего прочего, и \[российская армия\] вынуждена будет капитулировать. Чтобы этого не случилось, они просто выводят войска, пока есть возможность».

Юрий Федоров считает, что ВСУ тактически и оперативно переиграли российские войска, которым не хватило ресурсов для сдерживания этого наступления. «\[Сначала\] была прорвана оборона в районе Балаклеи. А затем российские войска были разбросаны гарнизонами по различным городкам, селам. Эти гарнизоны часто состояли из Росгвардии, а также мобилизованных из так называемых народных республик.

Росгвардия в принципе воевать не умеет, она не для этого предназначена. Задача этих гарнизонов и гвардейских полков заключалась в том, чтобы держать в подчинении местное население. А среди мобилизованных многие в первый раз взяли в руки автомат, надели каску, мотивации \[у них нет\] никакой. Российские регулярные части были отведены частично на правобережье в Херсонскую область, частично на Донецкое направление, где они пытались штурмовать пригород Донецка, занятый ВСУ. Поэтому вот такой разгром», — объясняет военный эксперт.

Это же подтверждает в разговоре с «Важными историями» и российский военнослужащий, который был на этом направлении. «\[Подведомственные\] Минобороны \[войска\], группировка Восток, вышли с этого направления еще в июле в Белгородскую область. На тот момент в Изюме я встречал БАРСов (_боевой армейский резерв страны_ — **Прим. ред.**), ополченцев и войска ПВО Западного округа. После \[их\] выхода в Изюм зашёл СОБР и ОМОН. Соответственно, там действительно остались только „БАРСики“, ополченцы и Росгвардия», — говорит он.

По словам эксперта Федорова, российское командование просчиталось в оценке ситуации, когда перебросило боевые части с юга Харьковской области на другие направления до начала контрнаступления. «Считалось, что в районе расположения изюмской группировки ничего страшного случиться не может. Просчет заключался в том, что не была оценена вероятность того, что украинские войска начнут там наступление», — говорит Федоров.

«Российское командование с профессиональной точки зрения оценивают как очень слабое. Это люди, которые умеют бросать в бой значительное количество живой силы, но отсутствует инициатива в исполнении приказа. Написано „занять такой-то перекресток“, а может быть, лучше занять другой перекресток рядышком, но это недопустимая вещь, \[только\] тупое упорное выполнение приказа», — добавляет он.

«Нельзя, чтобы армия, которая строилась двадцать лет, сегодня такая: все, мы будем работать по-другому. Нас заставляли быть тупыми и не принимать никаких решений, — подтверждает бывший военнослужащий российской армии. — Попробуй сержанту скажи, что ты считаешь, что лучше вот так вот. Тебе ебало просто сломают, если не застрелят сразу. И так на всех уровнях. Верховный главнокомандующий принимает только „‎правильные“‎ решения — а все остальные должны их исполнять. И если что, они будут нести наказание, не потому что сверху долбоебы, а потому что „‎вы плохо \[приказы\] исполняете, вы не исполнительные“»‎, — говорит он.

![Український контрнаступ та звільнення міста Балаклія Харківської області та навколишніх сіл](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201280%20960'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

«Самые успешные операции за всю мою службу были те, о которых знали только мы. Только те люди, которые в ней участвуют. Потому что стоит таким заняться командованию… Поэтому когда мы сами решали, что делать, не ожидая команды сверху или пока качнут связь, чтобы уточнить, связаться, запросить разрешение на выполнение, уточнение и прочую херню, мы всегда все выполняли на 100 %», — отмечает бывший военнослужащий одного из элитных подразделений ВС РФ.

Накануне, 9 сентября, Минобороны [показало](https://t.me/mod_russia/19710)
 кадры переброски военной техники в Харьковскую область, но это подкрепление не помогло отстоять города. «Этих подкреплений крайне недостаточно, — говорит Юрий Федоров. — Даже вертолетами перебрасывали личный состав и легкую технику. Но это все равно, что пытаться из пипетки наполнить стакан, практически бессмысленная задача».

Александр Коваленко объясняет это тем, что переброска поддержки была лишь пропагандистским жестом. «Российской армии срочно понадобилось демонстрировать некую активность, что „помощь близка“, „мы своих не бросаем“, якобы они готовы оказывать поддержку тем подразделениям, которые оказались в сложной ситуации. Но эта переброска имела неорганизованный, хаотический характер, она не могла обеспечить никакой поддержки», — говорит эксперт.

По его словам, те подразделения, которые зашли в зону боевых действий для поддержки, были обречены. Многие из них давным-давно требовали ротации или вывода для восстановления боеспособности из-за понесенных до этого серьезных потерь. «В ближайшее время мы будем узнавать о большом количестве подразделений российской армии, которые попросту перестали существовать, поскольку вместо вывода на восстановление боеспособности их кинули в самую мясорубку, самое жерло боевых столкновений», — говорит он.

### **Чем российской армии грозит прорыв ВСУ**

Освобождение Купянска и Изюма важно в стратегическом смысле тем, что оно отрезает российские группировки от путей снабжения и открывает ВСУ путь на Луганское и Донецкое направление, говорит украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. «Эти города важны тем, что они являются неотъемлемой частью логистических артерий поставок техники, материально-технического обеспечения, боеприпасов, личного состава как в Харьковскую область, так и в целом на донбасский плацдарм. Купянск является очень важным логистическим узлом, сердцем этой артерии.

Через него шло обеспечение города Изюм, который стал центром сосредоточения самой большой бронетанковой группы российских оккупантов за все время полномасштабного вторжения в Украину, — говорит эксперт. — И вся эта масса должна была идти в сторону Славянска и Краматорска. Сейчас планы по захвату Славянска и Краматорска можно считать аннулированными. Потеря \[российской армией\] таких населенных пунктов как Купянск и Изюм полностью рушит систему обеспечения донбасского плацдарма и позволяет ВСУ в дальнейшем развивать контрнаступательные действия уже не только в Харьковской области, но и в Луганском и Донецком направлениях».

В ближайшие дни можно ожидать, что Харьковская область будет освобождена, уверен российский военный эксперт Юрий Федоров. «Это не решающее сражение, но очень крупный успех ВСУ», — говорит он. По его словам, тогда вооруженные силы Украины смогут перебросить значительное количество личного состава и на другие направления.

Херсонская область
------------------

### **Российской армии не хватает сил для обороны**

Еще одно не менее важное направление, на котором продолжают наступать силы ВСУ, — контролируемый российскими войсками плацдарм на правом берегу Днепра в Херсонской области. Украинское контрнаступление началось там 29 августа. В тот день, по [данным](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1018539645523163)
 оперативной группировки ВСУ «Каховка», ей удалось «прорвать первую линию обороны» в Херсонской области. «109 полк „ДНР“ отошел со своих позиций, российские десантники, которые были их поддержкой, сбежали с поля боя», — [говорилось](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1018539645523163)
 в сообщении. 4 сентября ВСУ [установили](https://www.facebook.com/kirill.timoshenko/posts/5588117717898633)
 украинский флаг в крупном населенном пункте Высокополье.

Точная численность российской группировки, которая находится на правом берегу Днепра, где Украина ведет контрнаступление, неизвестна. По разным оценкам, на начало контрнаступления там находилось от [20](https://www.currenttime.tv/a/ukraine-russia-war-kherson/31989285.html)
 до [25 тысяч](https://www.currenttime.tv/a/32011307.html)
 российских военных. Нет точных данных и о численности украинской группировки. Источник «Важных историй» из числа бывших сотрудников российской спецслужбы, пожелавший остаться анонимным, говорит, что для контрнаступления в Херсонской области Украина сформировала «довольно скромные резервы»: их численность — 10–12 тысяч человек.

Однако, по его словам, у Украины есть еще резервы, не брошенные в контрнаступление, которые не должны позволить российской стороне замкнуть окружение вокруг прорвавшихся вперед войск. Максимальную оценку украинских сил на этом фронте [приводит](https://www.currenttime.tv/a/rf-boitsya-poteryat-litso-i-poetomu-otdaet-svoih-soldat-na-myaso-na-pravom-beregu-dnepra-eksperty-o-rasklade-sil-na-yuge-ukrainy-/32011763.html)
 украинский военный эксперт Роман Свитан: по его данным, там находится 30 тысяч бойцов ВСУ.

«Теми силами, которые присутствуют сейчас на правом берегу Днепра, российская армия в среднесрочной перспективе не сможет удерживать контрнаступление ВСУ», — уверен украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. По словам аналитика Conflict Intelligence Team (CIT) Кирилла Михайлова, ВСУ удалось создать определенное превосходство в численности личного состава на основных направлениях наступления в Херсонской области. «К этому добавляется эффективная работа артиллерии и локальное превосходство Украины в воздухе, которое позволяет использовать как фронтовую авиацию, так и ударные беспилотники», — комментирует он расстановку сил.

По его словам, сейчас украинцы наступают в Херсонской области как минимум на трех направлениях: с запада; северо-запада, где они расширяют плацдарм на оккупированном \[Россией\] берегу реки Ингулец; и с севера, где им удалось взять крупный населенный пункт Высокополье и «затрофеить» большое количество военной техники российского десанта. На сегодня украинской армии удалось продвинуться на территорию более десяти населенных пунктов в Херсонской области, говорит Михайлов. «Хоть эти населенные пункты и небольшие, они являются оборонительными узлами. Пока мы видим преимущество на украинской стороне», — говорит он.

Нехватку ресурсов у российской группировки на этом направлении подтверждает и бывший сотрудник российской спецслужбы. «Из-за нехватки солдат и офицеров российские войска на фронте сосредоточены в недостаточном количестве. Людей примерно в три раза меньше, чем нужно для выполнения поставленных задач: требуется минимум одна батальонно-тактическая группа на 3 километра, а у России — одна на 5 километров. Такой численностью не наступают, это похоже на авантюру, — говорит он. — Прорвав первую линию \[обороны\] российских войск, украинское наступление должно было упереться во вторую линию, но проблема в том, что у российской военной группировки ее нет: из-за нехватки людей такие прорывы затыкают лишь мобильными резервами. И это может сделать ситуацию непредсказуемой».

Достоверных данных о потерях обеих сторон в этой схватке сейчас нет, говорит аналитик CIT Кирилл Михайлов, но судя по [публикации](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/09/04/ukraine-is-losing-fewer-soldiers-in-its-counter-offensive-than-russia-claims)
 The Economist (журналисты побывали в прифронтовом городе Николаеве, поговорили с местными врачами и не увидели там «переполненных моргов» с погибшими украинскими военными, о чем утверждает российская сторона), хоть потери украинской армии выросли с началом наступления, они не катастрофические, как это заявляет российское Минобороны. По словам бывшего сотрудника российской спецслужбы, с которым поговорили «Важные истории», потери украинской стороны высоки, потому что наступающая сторона всегда теряет больше обороняющейся.

На третий день контрнаступления в Херсонской области The Wall Street Journal [поговорила](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ukrainian-soldiers-say-they-are-advancing-in-the-south-but-at-a-cost-11661983338)
 в госпитале с ранеными украинскими солдатами, которые участвовали в операции. По их словам, бои на пути к Херсону идут крайне ожесточенные, но украинские войска продвигаются вперед. «У них много техники, но мало людей», — сказал один из украинских военных. Кроме этого, они утверждают, что некоторые российские солдаты бегут со своих позиций, бросая технику и устанавливая мины на телах погибших товарищей.

По словам одного из российских военнослужащих, который сейчас находится в Херсонской области, российская армия там находится в тяжелом положении, солдаты массово пытаются уволиться. «Две недели назад командиры нам сказали, что на нас наступление идет. А нам даже боеприпасы никак не привезти, потому что дамба разбита (_вероятно, речь идет о дамбе в Новой Каховке_ — **Прим. ред.**). Люди каждый день ходят с рапортами \[на увольнение\], но почти всем их разрывают», — написал он. Спустя две недели военный передал «Важным историям», что при обстреле чудом выжил, и «там все жестко».

Другой источник, близкий к российским военнослужащим, которые находятся на Херсонском направлении, передал, что солдаты в полном шоке, «никто ничего не понимает, гибнут пачками, потери ужасные. Некоторые вообще звонят, прощаются, мы, говорят, смертники ебучие».

### **У российской армии проблемы со снабжением**

Еще одна проблема российской группировки, которая должна сдерживать прорыв украинской армии в Херсонской области, заключается в том, что она оказалась отрезанной от всех основных путей снабжения. Ранее снабжение российской группировки на правом берегу Днепра происходило через мосты, по которым везли боеприпасы, технику, топливо и продовольствие с левого берега реки. Однако в результате ударов ВСУ все стационарные мосты через Днепр были выведены из строя, понтонные и паромные переправы постоянно подвергаются обстрелам.

«\[Исход этого противостояния на правом берегу Днепра\] зависит от того, удастся ли россиянам организовать поставки \[снабжения\] паромами, поскольку все постоянные мосты перестали функционировать. Наладить понтонные переправы через Днепр \[российской армии\] не удалось. Сейчас функционирует несколько паромных переправ — их украинцам тяжелее поражать, чем мосты, потому что паромы мобильны, сложно предугадать, где они находятся.

Однако периодически украинцы пытаются поражать скопление российской техники в местах ожидания паромов. Это должно вызывать значительные проблемы со снабжением. Насколько россиянам хватит ресурсов для противостояния, зависит от того, смогут ли они эффективно перебрасывать подкрепление, а также от того, сколько продержатся силы ВДВ, пока у них не закончится техника, которая не отличается бронированностью», — говорит аналитик CIT Кирилл Михайлов.

### **Чем России грозит продвижение ВСУ** 

Освобождение украинскими войсками населенного пункта Высокополье в Херсонской области 4 сентября сделало невозможным для российской армии ведение наступательных действий в направлении Кривого Рога в Днепропетровской области, говорит украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. «Это была крайняя северная точка, откуда россияне могли развернуть наступательную операцию в Криворожском направлении. В настоящее время эти возможности у них отсутствуют, — объясняет он.

— Кроме того, благодаря Высокополью ВСУ получили возможность расширить плацдарм в правобережной части Херсонской области и сформировать условия для контрнаступления на достаточно угрожающем участке для многих подразделений ВС РФ. Если ВСУ будут достаточно успешно развивать наступательные действия, то мы сможем говорить о том, что огромное количество российских подразделений может оказаться фактически в окружении».

Стратегический и политический смысл операции на Херсонском направлении для Украины в том, чтобы разгромить российскую группировку на правом берегу Днепра и освободить Херсон, считает аналитик CIT Кирилл Михайлов. «Это позволит задействовать экономические ресурсы области, а также продемонстрировать западным партнерам Украины \[поставщикам оружия\], что страна в состоянии наступать и выигрывать — нужно только больше \[поставок\] оружия.

Кроме этого, в долгосрочной перспективе ликвидация правобережного плацдарма устраняет перспективу наступления \[российской армии\] на Николаев, Кривой Рог и Одессу, потому что именно захват мостов и выход на правый берег Днепра был самым значительным успехом россиян на первом этапе операции. Ликвидация этого плацдарма сильно снижает угрозу всей правобережной Украине, в том числе западному Черноморью, которое критически важно для Украины с точки зрения, например, экспорта сельхозпродукции», — объясняет эксперт значимость операции на этом направлении.

Где еще наступают ВСУ и какая битва будет решающей
--------------------------------------------------

Кроме Херсонской и Харьковской областей, ВСУ осуществляют наступательные действия в Донецкой области, говорит украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. В частности освобожден населенный пункт Озерное в Донецкой области. «Аналогичные новости будут поступать и из Луганской области, где значительно активизировались ВСУ, воспользовавшись ослаблением российских подразделений после достаточно продолжительного воздействия на них огневым потенциалом», — уверен эксперт.

По мнению Коваленко, решающей для этой войны битвой станет контрнаступление украинской армии в Запорожской области. «Битва за правобережную Херсонщину — это очень важный промежуточный этап. После ее завершения и освобождения Херсона будет освобождена и значительная часть ресурсов ВСУ, которые были задействованы для сдерживания российских оккупантов и для ведения этой контрнаступательной операции. И эти ресурсы могут быть использованы на других направлениях: Запорожской, Харьковской, Донецкой и Луганской областях.

Они сыграют решающую роль в значительном ускорении, увеличении активности и интенсивности действий ВСУ. Для командования российских войск очень важно сохранять контроль именно над Запорожской областью. Ее потеря для россиян — это фактически выстрел в висок, поскольку это станет потерей всего юга, а потеря всего юга — это и потеря Крыма. Выйдя в Запорожскую область, ВСУ получат возможность блокировать Крым с материковой части Украины и нанести удары по Керченскому мосту — то есть отрезать его от материковой части России и начать операцию по освобождению Крыма», — говорит он.

«Что война проиграна, можно было легко судить, когда не получилось взять Киев. Плюс сейчас начинается слякоть, холода, потом зима. И такие простые вещи как теплая одежда, нормальная обувь и место для ночлега, будут влиять как на на здоровье, так и на отношение людей на фронте к войне, — говорит бывший российский военный. — Это трагичный конец, которого мы и ожидали. Война работает в обе стороны: за что боролись, на то и напоролись. В наше руководство я не верю, конечно. Как родина нас кидает, мы и так знаем. Уже кинула, начиная с 14-го \[года\] — заканчивая сегодня. Сами это дерьмо устроили, естественно, мы охуеть как насосемся теперь. Проблема в том, что мы изначально на проигравшей и некомпетентной стороне были. Родина сначала кинула мясом, а теперь бросила умирать. И у этого нет ни цели, ни мотива, никакой пользы никому — ни единому человеку».

A recent photo confirms that Forward Observation Group, a private military firm under contract with Ukraine, is active in Kursk.

The Russian Foreign Ministry said that the participation of the American PMCs on the side of the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the invasion of the Kursk region proves the involvement of the United States as a [direct party to the conflict](https://eadaily.com/en/news/2024/08/22/mercenaries-from-the-forward-observation-group-pmcs-were-destroyed-in-the-kursk-region-video)
, and mercenaries automatically become a legitimate military target. To avoid a fair fight with an experienced lawyer, most insurance companies settle DBA claims on victim-friendly terms prior to this hearing.

For more information about DBA lost wage replacement, contact [Barnett, Lerner, Karsen, Frankel & Castro, P.A.](https://www.injuredoverseas.com/contact-us/)

  American Private Military Contractors Are in Kursk - Barnett, Lerner, Karsen, Frankel & Castro, P.A. The Foreign Ministry stressed that in relation to the American citizens involved, in accordance with the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, the necessary investigative actions will be carried out to bring them to justice.

The Russian press accused FOG contractors of targeting civilians during the fighting. Then, things changed.

Ukraine’s Kursk offensive is the latest phase in this war and marks the first time fighting has occurred on Russian soil. Prior to the Kursk incursion, Russia was taking roughly 1,000 casualties a day, with corresponding equipment losses. It would likely require several months of recruitment and military production to stop Ukrainian advances and secure Kursk. Alternatively, Russia could continue operations in the Donbas and pay the domestic price of ignoring the Ukrainian incursion and effectively ceding parts of Kursk and Belgorod to Ukraine. But Ukrainian mobile operations in Kursk require much more dynamic air operations, and Ukrainian drones have downed numerous Russian drones. Russia is now forced to fly longer distances in attempts to stop Ukraine in Kursk. Longer flights mean fewer Russian bombs dropped per day. 

#### **What Contractors Do**

That last section touched on the major responsibilities of American private military contractors operating independently of U.S."
