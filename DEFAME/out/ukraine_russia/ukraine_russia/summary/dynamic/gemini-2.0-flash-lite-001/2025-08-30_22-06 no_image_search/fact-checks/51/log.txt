The claim 'In February 2025 German Chancellor Olaf Scholz declared a state of emergency in Germany due to US President Donald Trump's peace plan for Ukraine.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. According to a Euronews fact-check from February 19, 2025, Olaf Scholz did not declare a state of emergency in Germany due to US peace talks with Russia; he referred to an urgent situation, not a state of emergency. Additionally, by August 2025, Friedrich Merz was the German Chancellor, not Olaf Scholz.

So, the overall veracity is: false
