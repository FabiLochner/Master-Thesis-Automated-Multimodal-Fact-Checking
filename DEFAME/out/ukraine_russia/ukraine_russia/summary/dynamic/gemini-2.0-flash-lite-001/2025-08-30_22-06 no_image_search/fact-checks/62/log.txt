Useful result: From [Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/in-first-israeli-drone-shot-down-over-iran-idf-says-no-fear-of-information-leaking/): 
Content: The Times of Israel reports that an Israeli Air Force Hermes 900 drone was shot down over the Isfahan area in central Iran on June 18, 2025. <image:9795>, <image:9764>. The IDF confirmed the drone crashed in Iran. The article includes a screenshot from IRIB showing the crashed drone.

The claim '<image:20> This image shows a US drone which was shot down in March 2025 by the Houthis using Russian missiles.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While the Houthis have shot down US drones, and drone crashes have occurred in Israel, there is no evidence to support the claim that the image depicts a US drone shot down by the Houthis. The image's origin and the type of aircraft involved are not confirmed.

So, the overall veracity is: false
