Useful result: From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Kursk): 
Content: The Wikipedia article discusses the Battle of Kursk, a major World War II battle in the Soviet Union in 1943. It mentions the German and Soviet forces involved, the strategic context, and the delays in the German offensive. The article also provides information on the Soviet plans and preparations, including intelligence gathering and the decision to adopt a strategic defense. The battle took place in July and August 1943. The article does not mention Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024. <image:26>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2025/01/17/to-cross-rivers-in-kursk-russia-reinvented-world-war-ii-funny-tanks/): 
Content: Forbes published an article on January 17, 2025, discussing the use of modified BTR-D air assault vehicles by Russian airborne troops in the Kursk Oblast to create bridges. The article mentions that Ukrainian forces carved a 250-square-mile salient out of Kursk in August. The article includes a photo of a Russian BTR-D bridging vehicle.

The claim '<image:26> This image shows destroyed Ukrainian tanks during Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is **false**. While the evidence confirms a military conflict in the Kursk Oblast in August 2024, involving destroyed military equipment, it does not explicitly confirm that the image depicts destroyed Ukrainian tanks. The type of tanks in the image cannot be determined based on the available information. The search results mention the use of modified BTR-D air assault vehicles by Russian forces in the area, but do not identify the tanks in the image.

So, the overall veracity is: false
