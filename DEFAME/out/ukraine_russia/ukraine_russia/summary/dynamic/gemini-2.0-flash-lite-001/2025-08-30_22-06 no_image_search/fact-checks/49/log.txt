Content: The New York Post published an article on September 25, 2024, discussing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's visit to the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant in Pennsylvania. <image:963> The article suggests that Zelensky's visit appeared to be a partisan political event, as he was accompanied by Democratic candidates and guarded by Secret Service agents.

The claim '<image:16> This image shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing Israeli bombs intended for use against Palestinians in Gaza.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false.
