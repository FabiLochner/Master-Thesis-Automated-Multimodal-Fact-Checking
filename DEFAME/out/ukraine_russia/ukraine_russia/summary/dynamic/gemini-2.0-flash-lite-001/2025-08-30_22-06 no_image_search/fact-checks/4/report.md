## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results discuss claims about the deaths of British Special Forces in Odesa, Ukraine. One source, from [UA Wire](https://www.uawire.org/false-allegations-of-british-sas-casualties-in-odesa-dutch-journalist-s-controversial-claims-debunked-by-ukrainian-military), debunks a claim made by Dutch journalist Sonja van den Ende that a Russian strike killed British soldiers, with the Ukrainian military denying the claims. ![image 9456](media/2025-08-30_22-07-1756591634-787188.jpg)

Another source, from [EADaily](https://eadaily.com/en/news/2024/07/22/russias-strike-on-odessa-killed-many-british-and-french-soldiers-pedro-bagnos), reports that a Russian strike on Odessa killed 18 members of the British Special Air Service, according to Colonel Pedro Bagnos. The image ![image 3](media/4.jpg) is not present in the search result. A third source, from [Detector Media](https://disinfo.detector.media/en/post/russian-aircraft-allegedly-destroyed-a-british-special-forces-group-in-odesa), discusses a similar claim originating from a tweet by Dutch journalist Sonia van den Ende, which was denied by Ukrainian authorities.


## Elaboration
The evidence presents conflicting information regarding the claim. While one source ([UA Wire](https://www.uawire.org/false-allegations-of-british-sas-casualties-in-odesa-dutch-journalist-s-controversial-claims-debunked-by-ukrainian-military)) debunks the claim of British Special Forces casualties in Odesa, another source ([EADaily](https://eadaily.com/en/news/2024/07/22/russias-strike-on-odessa-killed-many-british-and-french-soldiers-pedro-bagnos)) supports it, citing Colonel Pedro Bagnos.

## Actions
```
geolocate(![image 3](media/4.jpg))
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'United Kingdom': 0.9, 'France': 0.01, 'Ireland': 0.01, 'Israel': 0.01, 'Nigeria': 0.01, 'Tunisia': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0}

## Elaboration
The evidence is insufficient to verify the claim. The search results provide conflicting information about the deaths of British Special Forces in Odesa, Ukraine. The geolocation of the image suggests it was taken in the United Kingdom. More information is needed to confirm the details of the claim.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals conflicting reports regarding the claim of British Special Forces casualties in Odesa, Ukraine. While some sources debunk the claim, others support it. The image's geolocation suggests it was taken in the United Kingdom.

Given the conflicting evidence and lack of definitive confirmation, the claim cannot be verified. `false`
