## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Charlie Hebdo cover featuring Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a coffin is fake, according to [without-lie.info](https://without-lie.info/en/fake-with-another-fictional-cover-of-charlie-hebdo-magazine-with-a-caricature-of-the-president-of-ukraine/) and [Myth Detector](https://mythdetector.com/en/coffin-was-not-published-by-charlie-hebdo/). The fake cover was dated March 20, 2025, with issue number 1705, but the real cover was published on March 19, 2025. Myth Detector also notes that the issue number 1705 matches the one published on March 26. [Africanews](https://www.africanews.com/2025/05/06/fake-charlie-hebdo-cover-shows-zelenskyy-exploiting-popes-death-for-cash//) also reports on a fake Charlie Hebdo cover. ![image 14](media/47.jpg) ![image 9642](media/2025-08-30_22-18-1756592291-716243.jpg) ![image 9648](media/2025-08-30_22-19-1756592347-107967.jpg)


## Elaboration

The date and issue number on the cover do not align with the actual Charlie Hebdo publications.

The claim is demonstrably false. Multiple sources confirm that the Charlie Hebdo cover depicting Zelenskyy in a coffin is fake. The date and issue number on the cover do not match the actual publications.
