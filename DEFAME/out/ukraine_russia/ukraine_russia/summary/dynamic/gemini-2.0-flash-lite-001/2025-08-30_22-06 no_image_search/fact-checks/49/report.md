## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The claim that Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed Israeli bombs intended for use against Palestinians in Gaza is false. According to the Eurovision News | Spotlight ([https://spotlight.ebu.ch/p/video-caption-falsely-claims-zelenskyy](https://spotlight.ebu.ch/p/video-caption-falsely-claims-zelenskyy)), the video shows Zelenskyy at a U.S. munitions factory signing artillery shells for Ukraine's war with Russia, not Israel's war in Gaza.

### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing ammunition at the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant (SCAAP) in Scranton, Pennsylvania, USA, on September 23, 2024. The BBC News articles ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80rkv0k4j8o](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80rkv0k4j8o), [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c80rkv0k4j8o](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c80rkv0k4j8o)) and the New York Post article ([https://nypost.com/2024/09/25/opinion/zelenskys-arms-factory-visit-reeks-of-partisan-foreign-election-interference/](https://nypost.com/2024/09/25/opinion/zelenskys-arms-factory-visit-reeks-of-partisan-foreign-election-interference/)) all feature the image. The articles do not mention Israeli bombs or Gaza.

The New York Post article suggests that Zelensky's visit appeared to be a partisan political event. ![image 954](media/2025-08-06_18-18-1754504302-187821.jpg) ![image 960](media/2025-08-06_18-18-1754504308-548113.jpg) ![image 963](media/2025-08-06_18-18-1754504311-967303.jpg)


## Elaboration
The claim is false. The image shows Zelenskyy signing artillery shells at a U.S. munitions factory in Pennsylvania, not Israeli bombs. The munitions are intended for Ukraine's war with Russia, not for use against Palestinians in Gaza.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that the image depicts Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing artillery shells at a U.S. munitions factory, not Israeli bombs intended for use against Palestinians in Gaza. Multiple sources confirm this, and the claim misrepresents the context of the image.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. The image shows Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing artillery shells at a U.S. munitions factory, as reported by the [Eurovision News | Spotlight](https://spotlight.ebu.ch/p/video-caption-falsely-claims-zelenskyy), not Israeli bombs intended for use against Palestinians in Gaza. The shells are for Ukraine's war with Russia.
