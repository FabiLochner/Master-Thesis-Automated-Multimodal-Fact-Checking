Useful result: From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8_July_2024_Russian_strikes_on_Ukraine): 
Content: The Wikipedia article discusses the Russian missile strikes on Ukraine on July 8, 2024, which targeted Kyiv, Kryvyi Rih, Dnipro, Kropyvnytskyi, and Pokrovsk. The attacks resulted in at least 47 deaths and 170 injuries. The Okhmatdyt children's hospital in Kyiv was hit, and the international community condemned the attacks. The Russian defence ministry claimed the strikes targeted defense industry targets and aviation bases. The UN and various NGOs also condemned the attacks. <image:8> is an image of the Okhmatdyt children's hospital after the attack.

The claim '<image:8> This image shows fake children's toys that were photoshopped into the image by the Ukrainian Government after Kyiv's pediatric hospital was attacked by Russian cruise missiles on July 8, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. Multiple sources, including the [Kyiv Independent](https://kyivindependent.com/), [Human Rights Watch](https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/07/11/russias-july-8-attack-childrens-hospital-ukraine), and the [United Nations](https://press.un.org/en/2024/sc15761.doc.htm), confirm that the Okhmatdyt children's hospital in Kyiv was hit by Russian missiles on July 8, 2024. The image depicts the aftermath of the attack, and the presence of children's toys is consistent with the context.

So, the overall veracity is: false
