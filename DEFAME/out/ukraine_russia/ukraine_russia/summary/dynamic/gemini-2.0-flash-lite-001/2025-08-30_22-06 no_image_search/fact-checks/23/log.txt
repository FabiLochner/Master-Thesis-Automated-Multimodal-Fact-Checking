Useful result: From [Source](https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-us-aid-going-ukraine): 
Content: The Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) states that since the Russian invasion in February 2022, Ukraine has become the top recipient of U.S. aid. The article mentions that in early March 2025, President Donald Trump froze all military aid to Ukraine, lifting the freeze shortly after. The article also mentions a $20 billion loan provided to the Ukrainian government in late 2024. The article does not mention the exact amount of military aid provided to Ukraine as of February 2025.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.npr.org/2025/08/05/g-s1-81084/europe-us-weapons-ukraine-russia-war): 
Content: NPR published an article on August 5, 2025, discussing military aid to Ukraine. The article mentions that the U.S. has provided around $75 billion in military assistance to Ukraine since the full-scale invasion in 2022. It also mentions that President Trump announced a new arrangement to send weapons to Ukraine last month. <image:496>, <image:497>.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.csis.org/analysis/trump-administration-boosts-immediate-military-aid-deliveries-ukraine): 
Content: The CSIS published an article on February 11, 2025, discussing the Trump administration's boost to military aid deliveries to Ukraine. <image:503>, <image:502>, <image:501>. Another article published on July 25, 2025, mentions the administration's announcement of military aid for Ukraine. The Trump administration announced weapons sales to Ukraine totaling $652 million under the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program, adding to the $310 million in FMS approved in May. The policy appears to keep in place the military aid committed under the Biden administration, which is set to deliver around $30 billion over the next three-and-a-half years.

The claim 'As of February 2025, the United States had given $350 billion in military aid to Ukraine for its war with Russia.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While the U.S. has provided military aid to Ukraine, the evidence, including sources like NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2025/08/05/g-s1-81084/europe-us-weapons-ukraine-russia-war](https://www.npr.org/2025/08/05/g-s1-81084/europe-us-weapons-ukraine-russia-war)), indicates a much lower figure than $350 billion.

So, the overall veracity is: false
