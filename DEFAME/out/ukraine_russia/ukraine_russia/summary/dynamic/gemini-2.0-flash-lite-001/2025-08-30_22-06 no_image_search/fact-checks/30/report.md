CNN published an article on August 19, 2025, discussing the difference between a ceasefire and a peace deal in the context of the war between Ukraine and Russia (![image 1](media/0.jpg), ![image 2](media/3.jpg), ![image 3](media/4.jpg), ![image 4](media/5.jpg), ![image 5](media/6.jpg)).

Wikipedia mentions a timeline of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, including a section for January 2025 – May 2025, and June 2025 – present. It also mentions that in December 2024, Donald Trump, after winning the U.S. presidential election, began a push for peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine.


### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results include a Wikipedia article providing a timeline of the Russian invasion of Ukraine from January 1, 2025, to May 31, 2025, detailing military actions, attacks, and political events, including mentions of peace negotiations. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine\_(1\_January\_2025\_%E2%80%93\_31\_May\_2025)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine_(1_January_2025_%E2%80%93_31_May_2025)))

PBS News published a timeline of territorial shifts during Russia’s war on Ukraine on August 18, 2025. ([https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/a-timeline-of-territorial-shifts-during-russias-war-on-ukraine](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/a-timeline-of-territorial-shifts-during-russias-war-on-ukraine)) The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) published an assessment on August 24, 2025, discussing the ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia, including the rejection of US-proposed peace initiatives by the Russian Foreign Minister.

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that peace negotiations were ongoing in 2025, with Donald Trump playing a role. However, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) reported on August 24, 2025, that the Russian Foreign Minister rejected US-proposed peace initiatives. This indicates that a peace deal had not been reached by late August 2025.

The Wikipedia timeline for January-May 2025 mentions peace negotiations, but it does not explicitly state that a deal was reached.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that peace negotiations were ongoing in early 2025, but there is no evidence to support the claim that a peace deal was reached. The Institute for the Study of War reported that peace initiatives were rejected by Russia in August 2025.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The evidence indicates that while peace negotiations were underway in early 2025, no peace deal was reached. The Institute for the Study of War reported in August 2025 that Russia rejected US-proposed peace initiatives, indicating the war was still ongoing.
