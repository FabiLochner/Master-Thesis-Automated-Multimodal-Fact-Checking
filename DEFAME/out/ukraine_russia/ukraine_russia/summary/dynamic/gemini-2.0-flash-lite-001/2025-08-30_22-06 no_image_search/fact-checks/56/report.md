## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Ben Stiller met with Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv on June 20, 2022. However, the provided sources do not mention that Stiller received $4 million from USAID for the meeting.

Therefore, the claim is partially verifiable. The information about the meeting is accurate, but the claim about the payment from USAID is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The image does show Ben Stiller and Volodymyr Zelenskyy meeting on June 20, 2022. However, the provided evidence does not support the claim that Stiller received $4 million from USAID.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE
