Useful result: From [Source](https://www.injuredoverseas.com/?p=11300): 
Content: The website injuredoverseas.com reports that the Forward Observation Group, a private military firm under contract with Ukraine, is active in Kursk. The Russian Foreign Ministry stated that the participation of American PMCs proves the involvement of the United States as a direct party to the conflict. The Russian press accused FOG contractors of targeting civilians. <image:9777>

Useful result: From [Source](https://mythdetector.com/en/disseminated-image-does-not-prove-that-americans-fight-in-kursk/): 
Content: Myth Detector fact-checked the claim that the image shows American fighters in the Kursk region. The image was posted on Facebook by Irakli Zakareishvili. According to Myth Detector, the claim is disinformation. The photo was taken in the Kharkiv region in 2022 and the person depicted is a Ukrainian actor, Serhii Filimonov. <image:9785>, <image:9778>, <image:9779>. The article was published on August 19, 2024.

The claim '<image:24> This image shows American mercenaries participating in Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While Russia claimed the presence of American mercenaries in the Kursk region, the image used to support the claim has been debunked as disinformation. The photo was taken in the Kharkiv region in 2022 and features a Ukrainian actor, not American mercenaries in the Kursk Oblast in August 2024, as reported by [Myth Detector](https://www.mythdetector.ge/en/article/fake-photo-american-fighters-kursk-region).

So, the overall veracity is: false
