The Independent published an article discussing Elon Musk's accusations against Volodymyr Zelenskyy, including a claim that Zelenskyy is "despised by the people of Ukraine." The article also mentions that Musk vowed to "fix" X's Community Notes feature. The article was published on February 20, 2025. ([https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/elon-musk-x-ukraine-trump-zelensky-b2702216.html](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/elon-musk-x-ukraine-trump-zelensky-b2702216.html)) ![image 9562](media/2025-08-30_22-13-1756591996-163922.jpg) Anadolu Agency reported that Elon Musk claimed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy "killed an American journalist" on his X account on February 20, 2025.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Elon Musk was actively posting on X about Volodymyr Zelenskyy in February 2025. However, the provided articles do not mention any plans by Musk to suspend Zelenskyy's X account. One article from Anadolu Agency reports that Musk accused Zelenskyy of killing an American journalist. Other articles discuss Musk's criticism of Zelenskyy and his claims about the Ukrainian leader's popularity.

Based on the available evidence, the claim cannot be verified. The search results do not provide any information about Musk planning to suspend Zelenskyy's account.

To verify the claim, information about Musk's specific posts regarding the suspension of Zelenskyy's account is needed.

## Elaboration
