Useful result: From [Source](https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-exploits-wildfires-in-los-angeles-to-push-anti-u-s-anti-ukraine-propaganda/7938909.html):

The article mentions Maria Zakharova's comments and a claim by Lavrov. The article also discusses how Russian state-controlled news sites spread disinformation about the wildfires. <image:2557>

The claim 'Russia offered assistance for the California wildfires from January 2025.' is false.
Justification: The fact-check reveals that while Russia commented on the California wildfires in January 2025 and used them for propaganda, there is no evidence from sources like Tasnim News Agency, The Dispatch, NPR, and Voice of America to support the claim that Russia offered assistance for the wildfires.

So, the overall veracity is: false
