## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The 2024 G20 summit was held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from November 18â€“19, 2024, with the theme "Building a Just World and a Sustainable Planet" (<image:k>). Giorgia Meloni, the Italian Prime Minister, was listed as a participant in the summit, but was not present when the final text was approved according to an article from The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/19/ukraine-russia-g20-communique](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/19/ukraine-russia-g20-communique)).

Anadolu Agency reported on November 19, 2024, that Meloni stated she understood the US's decision to allow Ukraine to use long-range missiles inside Russia, but Italy has made a different choice ([https://www.aa.com.tr/en/europe/italian-premier-says-she-understands-us-response-to-russia-but-rome-makes-a-different-choice/3398224](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/europe/italian-premier-says-she-understands-us-response-to-russia-but-rome-makes-a-different-choice/3398224)). The final communique was criticized by Ukraine's allies for not highlighting Russia's invasion.


## Elaboration
1.  The evidence indicates that Giorgia Meloni attended the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro in November 2024.
2.  Meloni was not present when the final text was approved.
3.  Meloni stated that she understood the US's decision to allow Ukraine to use long-range missiles inside Russia, but Italy made a different choice.
4.  The evidence does not support the claim that Meloni condemned the US-Ukrainian bombing of Russia.


## Final Judgement
The provided evidence indicates that Giorgia Meloni attended the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro in November 2024, but it does not support the claim that she condemned the US-Ukrainian bombing of Russia. In fact, she stated that she understood the US's decision to allow Ukraine to use long-range missiles inside Russia, but Italy made a different choice.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The evidence from the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro in November 2024, as reported by The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/19/ukraine-russia-g20-communique](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/19/ukraine-russia-g20-communique)) and Anadolu Agency ([https://www.aa.com.tr/en/europe/italian-premier-says-she-understands-us-response-to-russia-but-rome-makes-a-different-choice/3398224](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/europe/italian-premier-says-she-understands-us-response-to-russia-but-rome-makes-a-different-choice/3398224)), shows that while Giorgia Meloni attended the summit, she did not condemn the US-Ukrainian actions. Instead, she expressed understanding of the US's position.
