KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Saturday that excluding his country from talks between the U.S. President Donald Trump could bring Russian President Vladimir Putin to the table with [the threat of sanctions](https://apnews.com/article/us-russia-ukraine-trump-6501850b84c460824a722a233d46c4e6)

“They may have their own relations, but talking about Ukraine without us — it is dangerous for everyone,” Zelenskyy said.

He said his team has been in contact with the Trump administration, but those discussions are at a “general level,” and he believes in-person meetings will take place soon to develop more detailed agreements.

“We need to work more on this,” he said, adding that Trump understandably appeared to be focused on domestic issues in the first weeks after his inauguration.

The nearly three-year war in Ukraine is at a crossroads. But a planned visit by [Trump’s Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg](https://apnews.com/article/trump-transition-ukraine-russia-war-kellogg-68b413ecde625f6643aebe5759a752e7)

, a longstanding wish for Kyiv that Moscow has categorically rejected, is still Zelenskyy’s top choice.

NATO membership is the “cheapest” option for Ukraine’s allies, and it would also strengthen Trump geopolitically, Zelenskyy argued.

“I really believe that these are the cheapest security guarantees that Ukraine can get, the cheapest for everyone,” he said.

“It will be a signal that it is not for Russia to decide who should be in NATO and who should not, but for the United States of America to decide."

Their work has reinforced AP’s influence as a go-to news outlet for Zelenskyy’s most critical interviews.

AP Interview: Zelenskyy says excluding Ukraine from U.S.-Russia talks about war is ‘very dangerous’

[! While the Kyiv team has tirelessly lobbied the Ukrainian government for access and interviews throughout the country’s nearly three-year conflict with Russia—and secured previous sit-downs with Zelenskyy—this was the first time his office approached AP to propose an interview.

With just hours to prepare, the entire team sprang into action. Reporter Illia Novikov provided live, simultaneous translation, longtime photographer Efrem Lukatsky captured images, and Yurchuk produced the video.

The result: an hourlong interview in which Zelenskyy warned that excluding Ukraine from U.S.-Russia war talks is “very dangerous,” called for Kyiv and Washington to develop a ceasefire plan, and outlined his latest thinking on security guarantees needed for a peace deal and NATO membership.

The judges were impressed by the team’s ability to move quickly and deliver such a polished and impactful interview under intense time constraints. 29, 2025\

**Q1: What did President Zelensky say that started this controversy?**

:

When I hear that America gave Ukraine hundreds of billions \[of dollars\], 177, to be more precise . He speaks about supporting the “army” where aid helped all elements of the Ukrainian armed forces, and he appears to include only weapons as aid “received.”

**Q2: How was that interpreted?**

**A2:** Many people asked where the “missing” $100 billion went and seized on the statement, “I don’t know where all the money is.”

Comment sections of media reports [flamed with accusations of corruption and malfeasance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWcsdMUDDjc)

Critical Questions by [Mark F. surge forces in Europe, and intelligence support for both NATO and Ukraine.

As [CSIS has reported before](https://breakingdefense.com/2023/10/most-aid-to-ukraine-is-spent-in-the-us-a-total-shutdown-would-be-irresponsible/)
, “aid to Ukraine” is a misnomer because 90 percent of military aid is spent in the United States. We are talking about specific things, because we got it, not with money but with weapons. I don’t know where all the money is.

The statement is a bit confusing since he was speaking off the cuff in a video interview. Agency for International Development (USAID) payments to celebrities to visit Ukraine. [Members of Congress](https://x.com/NancyMace/status/1886175308086161522)
 and Elon Musk, who leads DOGE, [amplified](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1886132832495378684)
 posts questioning the misuse of aids.

General Keith Kellogg, the Trump administration’s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, denied these interpretations. In private conversations, Republican congressional staff members say that the confusion and hint of corruption have poisoned the possibility of further aid, at least in the near term.

**Q3: So, what happened to the “missing” $100 billion?**

**A3:** The short answer is that it is not missing."

US President [Donald Trump](/en/donald-trump/t-19434433)
 has hurled insults and personal attacks at the Ukrainian President [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](/en/volodymyr-zelenskyy/t-65603134)
 and has since doubled down in a [post on X](https://archive.is/4NhOr "External link — post on X")
, heading for 100 million views at the time this article was published.

Trump called Zelenskyy a "dictator without elections" who had lost the support of the Ukrainian people, telling him he "better move fast" to negotiate an end to [Russia's invasion of Ukraine](/en/russias-war-in-ukraine/t-60931789)
 or he might not have a country left, among other things.

On Thursday, the US requested a [joint press conference be canceled](/en/ukraine-zelenskyy-wants-strong-ties-to-united-states/live-71678356)
 after talks between Zelenskyy and Trump's Ukraine envoy in Kyiv.

DW's [Fact Check team](/en/fact-check/t-56584214)
 takes an in-depth look at Trump's claims.

Is Zelenskyy a dictator who is refusing to hold elections?    
--------------------------------------------------------------

**Claim:** Trump said Zelenskyy was a "dictator without elections."

**DW Fact check:** False.

Zelenskyy was elected to a five-year term in April 2019, winning 74.96% of the vote in a second-round run-off with incumbent Petro Poroshenko.

According to the [Ukrainian constitution](https://perma.cc/VBX9-NHRY "External link — Ukrainian constitution")
, the next presidential election ought to have taken place on the final Sunday of March 2024, but it was postponed due to the imposition of martial law.

[Article 19 of the Ukrainian law "On the Legal Regime of Martial Law"](https://archive.ph/1sxGv "External link — Article 19 of the Ukrainian law "On the Legal Regime of Martial Law"")
 explicitly prohibits the holding of national and local elections during a state of war. According to the report, about 57% of Ukrainians said they trusted Zelenskyy. An earlier poll published by the [International Republican Institute](https://www.iri.org/resources/national-survey-of-ukraine-sept-oct-2024/ "External link — International Republican Institute")
 last fall said that 69% of Ukrainians approved of his actions and 42% even strongly opposed elections for a new President.

Trump has not given a source for his single-digit claim.

In response, Zelenskyy said these false figures were part of Russia's disinformation campaign and the US President ["unfortunately lives in this disinformation space."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qoq3IqIT90I "External link — "unfortunately lives in this disinformation space."")

According to recent polls, the majority of Ukrainians are satisfied with Zelenskyy as presidentImage: President of Ukraine/ZUMA Press/IMAGO

Has the US spent $350 billion on Ukraine?
-----------------------------------------

**Claim**: "Zelenskyy talked the United States of America into spending $350 billion."

**DW Factcheck**: Unproven. 

Trump didn't provide any sources for these amounts and the sum differs greatly from figures published elsewhere.

According to the US government's [Ukraine oversight working group](https://archive.ph/YMO0u "External link — Ukraine oversight working group")
, the US contribution to Ukraine aid totals $203 billion: "Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Congress has appropriated or otherwise made available nearly $183 billion for Operation Atlantic Resolve and the broader Ukraine response. Article 71 of the Ukrainian constitution stipulates that elections are to be "free and take place on the basis of universal, equal and direct suffrage by secret ballot."

But with millions of Ukrainians serving in the armed forces, having fled the country, or living in areas occupied by the Russian army, it would be impossible to ensure the entire electorate is given an equal chance to vote by the required standards.

Is Zelenskyy running low in the polls?
--------------------------------------

**Claim:** Trump has claimed that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's approval ratings have plummeted, saying he was "very low in Ukrainian polls" with a ["4% approval rating."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VneqUgovNVI "External link — "4% approval rating."")

**DW Fact check:** False.

Zelenskyy "retains a fairly high level of public trust," a poll conducted by the [Kyiv International Institute of Sociology](https://www.kiis.com.ua/?lang=eng&cat=reports&id=1496&page=1 "External link — Kyiv International Institute of Sociology")
 found in early February 2025. Additionally, the United States provided $20 billion in loans as part of the G7 nations extraordinary revenue acceleration loans initiative."

However, in reporting about Ukraine aid, the media often cite data collected by the [Ukraine Support Tracker (UST)](https://www.ifw-kiel.de/topics/war-against-ukraine/ukraine-support-tracker/ "External link — Ukraine Support Tracker (UST)")
, a project by the German think tank, the Kiel Institute for the World Economy. Which is significantly less than the official US figures.

When asked about the gap between these figures and Trump's $350 billion claim, UST project leader Taro Nishikawa told DW: "This figure appears to be based on a different calculation and definition of aid. It may also include categories that we do not track in our dataset."

Can Ukraine-attached spending explain the gap?
----------------------------------------------

The UST's [dataset documentation](https://www.ifw-kiel.de/fileadmin/Dateiverwaltung/Subject_Dossiers_Topics/Ukraine/Ukraine_Support_Tracker/Dataset_Documentation.pdf "External link — dataset documentation")
 shows how difficult it is to define Ukraine aid.

For example, UST calculations do not include activities such as the training of Ukrainian soldiers, aid from NGOs that may be co-financed by governments or incentives for companies to donate to Ukraine. There are also multi-billion military and intelligence expenses by the US Department of Defense and the United States European Command which are dedicated to the region, but not exclusively to Ukraine.

At the same time, some analysts say that a large share of Ukraine's aid remains in the US economy.

[According to the US publication _Lawfare_](https://archive.ph/0meEI "External link — According to the US publication Lawfare")
: "Only a small percentage of the overall aid package takes the form of cash transfers to Kyiv." A significant part of the aid, the author writes, consists in paying US soldiers to train Ukrainian troops, or in sending weapons, ammunition and other military equipment from US stocks dedicated to rapid military aid under the [Foreign Assistance Act](https://perma.cc/J9ZN-8L37 "External link — Foreign Assistance Act")
. These stocks are then refilled by the US military industry.  While the US was subsidizing their economy the US government is still donating weaponry to Ukraine.

Even if you were to factor in all the funding somehow related to the war in Ukraine the UST had excluded from the grand total (see "Summary of US Acts" table), that would bring the overall US aid commitment for Ukraine up to $213 billion as of April 24, 2024 – a sum that surpasses the official figure, but still falls short of Trump's $350 billion claim.

Who has spent more on Ukraine: the USA or Europe?
-------------------------------------------------

**Claim**: "The United States has spent $200 billion more than Europe."

The claim fits Trump's talking point of everybody taking advantage of the US. With what Trump refers to as "Europe" giving shelter to more than 70%, and the US receiving less than 5% of them, his claim does not appear any more reasonable.

([Source](https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-trumps-attacks-on-zelenskyy-and-ukraine-aid/a-71702392)) VOA News discusses a claim by Dmitry Medvedev that Zelenskyy admitted to embezzling $100 billion of U.S. funds, stating that Zelenskyy said Ukraine received $76 billion in military assistance from the U.S., not the reported $177 billion. The U.S. has provided $175 billion in aid to Ukraine. ([Source](https://www.voanews.com/a/false-russian-allegations-that-ukraine-stole-100-billion-of-us-funds/7967072.html)) <image:2137>


## Elaboration
Zelenskyy stated in an interview with the Associated Press that Ukraine received $76 billion out of $177 billion in U.S. aid. The U.S. has provided $175 billion in aid to Ukraine. The claim that Zelenskyy's statement confirms the U.S. aid is a money laundering operation is not directly supported by the evidence. The evidence does show that a portion of the aid has not been received, which has led to questions about where the remaining funds have gone. However, the evidence does not provide enough information to confirm the claim.

 would be “very dangerous" and asked for more discussions between Kyiv and Washington to develop a plan for a ceasefire.

Speaking in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press, Zelenskyy said Russia does not want to engage in ceasefire talks or to discuss any kind of concessions, which the Kremlin interprets as losing at a time when its troops have [the upper hand on the battlefield](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-donetsk-pokrovsk-8461cfeef0cf7850c292b4a8ff24c88f)

He said U.S. President Donald Trump could bring Russian President Vladimir Putin to the table with the threat of sanctions targeting Russia’s energy and banking system, as well as continued support of the Ukrainian military.

“I think these are the closest and most important steps,” he said in the interview in the Ukrainian capital that lasted for more than an hour.

Zelenskyy's remarks followed comments Friday by Trump, who said American and Russian officials were [“already talking”](https://apnews.com/article/trump-putin-russia-ukraine-6c5a098488e64cd7643a89f4aaacd249)

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says that excluding his country from talks between the U\_S\_ and Russia about the war in Ukraine would be “very dangerous.”

By Associated Press

Feb. (AP Photo/Efrem Lukatsky)

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Saturday that excluding his country from talks between the U.S. [Trump](https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump)
 said his administration has had “very serious” discussions with Russia, but he did not elaborate.

“They may have their own relations, but talking about Ukraine without us — it is dangerous for everyone,” Zelenskyy said.

He said his team has been in contact with the Trump administration, but those discussions are at a “general level,” and he believes in-person meetings will take place soon to develop more detailed agreements.

“We need to work more on this,” he said, adding that Trump understandably appeared to be focused on domestic issues in the first weeks after his inauguration.

The nearly three-year war in Ukraine is at a crossroads. In those areas, Moscow-appointed authorities are swiftly erasing any hint of Ukrainian identity.

With Trump back in the White House, Ukraine’s relationship with the U.S., its largest and most important ally, is also at a tipping point.

In an initial phone call with Trump during the presidential campaign, Zelenskyy said, they agreed that if Trump won, they would meet to discuss the steps needed to end the war. But how will it turn out I don’t know.”

Zelenskyy cautioned against allowing Putin to take “control" over the war, an apparent reference to to Russia's repeated threats of escalation during President Joe Biden's administration.

Without security guarantees from Ukraine’s allies, Zelenskyy said, any deal struck with Russia would only serve as a precursor to future aggression."

The article also mentions Zelenskyy's view that NATO membership is the "cheapest" option for Ukraine's allies.

The U.S. News & World Report also published an article on February 1, 2025, discussing the AP interview with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (<image:0>). The article mentions Zelenskyy's statements about talks between Moscow and Washington, which should not exclude Ukraine.

## Elaboration
The provided evidence does not contain any information about the amount of U.S. aid received by Ukraine, nor does it mention any statements by Zelenskyy regarding the portion of aid received. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
An article from CSIS discusses the controversy surrounding U.S. aid to Ukraine, mentioning that Zelenskyy stated Ukraine received $76 billion out of $177 billion in U.S. aid in an interview with the Associated Press on February 2, leading to questions about the "missing" $100 billion. The article also notes that a significant portion of the aid is spent in the United States. ([Source](https://www.csis.org/analysis/where-missing-100-billion-us-aid-ukraine)) <image:2135>

DW's fact check discusses Trump's claims about Zelenskyy and U.S. aid to Ukraine, stating that the U.S. government's Ukraine oversight working group estimates the U.S. contribution to Ukraine aid at $203 billion. ([Source](https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-trumps-attacks-on-zelenskyy-and-ukraine-aid/a-71702392)) VOA News discusses a claim by Dmitry Medvedev that Zelenskyy admitted to embezzling $100 billion of U.S. funds, stating that Zelenskyy said Ukraine received $76 billion in military assistance from the U.S., not the reported $177 billion. The U.S. has provided $175 billion in aid to Ukraine. ([Source](https://www.voanews.com/a/false-russian-allegations-that-ukraine-stole-100-billion-of-us-funds/7967072.html)) <image:2137>


## Elaboration
Zelenskyy stated in an interview with the Associated Press that Ukraine received $76 billion out of $177 billion in U.S. aid. The U.S. has provided $175 billion in aid to Ukraine. The claim that Zelenskyy's statement confirms the U.S. aid is a money laundering operation is not directly supported by the evidence. The evidence does show that a portion of the aid has not been received, which has led to questions about where the remaining funds have gone. However, the evidence does not provide enough information to confirm the claim.

### **CLAIM**

Posts claimed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed artillery shells destined to be dropped on Gaza during a visit to a Pennsylvania munitions factory.

* * *

### **BACKGROUND**

A video and still images shared online were described as showing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing artillery shells destined for use in Gaza by Israel.

One [version](https://x.com/firasshams1/status/1896565304148574479)
 of video was circulated online at the beginning of March with the caption: “For those feeling sorry for Volodymyr Zelensky, here’s the Ukrainian President signing bombs to be dropped on innocent Gazans”. Zelensky signing bombs that killed Palestinian women and children”.

* * *

### **METHOD**

The video of Zelenskyy and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro signing artillery shells began to circulate online following an eventful meeting at the White House between Zelenskyy, President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance on February 28 which turned into a near-shouting match. [![Eurovision News | Spotlight](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!u-Oh!,w_80,h_80,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82236b8f-82a2-4d9e-bc4b-1a00add2558a_1280x1280.png)](/)

 \[Accessed 13 Mar. During the meeting, Trump told Zelenskyy to make a deal with Russia to end the war in Ukraine. He also told Zelenskyy he was “[gambling with World War III](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/28/trump-vance-zelenskyy-oval-office-exchange-00206727)
”.

A reverse Google Image search of a screen shot from the video however revealed that it was published several months before the fateful White House meeting.

Governor Josh Shapiro shared the video on September 23, 2024, with a caption referencing Ukraine’s war with Russia. This version allowed us to see that Zelenskyy wrote “Glory to Ukraine” on one shell and “Thanks for Support” on another, both referencing Ukraine’s war with Russia and not Israel’s war in Gaza.

[Information](https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/prezident-vidvidav-skrentonskij-armijskij-boyepripasnij-zavo-93389)
 about Zelenskyy’s visit to the ammunition factory, as well as details on its operations, was provided on Ukraine’s official government website.

“The plant’s capacity is fully dedicated to meeting Ukraine’s needs, particularly for the production of 155mm shells, which has significantly increased over the past year,” the statement read.

A statement regarding the visit was also released on the U.S. Army [website](https://www.army.mil/article/279911/ukrainian_president_zelenskyy_tours_scranton_army_ammunition_plant)
 which confirmed the factory was being used to bolster Ukraine’s ammunition stockpile.

* * *

### **RATING**

The video shows Zelenskyy visiting a munitions factory that produces armaments for the Ukrainian Security and Defense Forces, not Israel. It was published five months before the February 2025 meeting and a longer version of the video reveals that Zelenskyy’s handwritten messages do not reference Ukraine’s war with Russia or Israel’s war in Gaza. Available at: [For those feeling sorry for Volodymyr Zelensky](https://x.com/firasshams1/status/1896565304148574479)

Zelenskyy's "Glory to Ukraine" inscription on US bombs in Pennsylvania stirs controversy
========================================================================================

15 October 2024 18:57

**Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's recent visit to Pennsylvania has stirred significant controversy, raising questions about the intersection of foreign diplomacy and US electoral politics.** 

During a tour aimed at bolstering support for Ukraine, Zelenskyy made headlines after signing munitions at the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant, a move that has elicited mixed reactions from both local residents and political leaders, **[Caliber.Az](https://caliber.az/en)
** reports, **[citing](https://www.politico.eu/article/polish-american-lean-donald-trump-despite-ukraine-war-dupont-pennsylvania/)** Politico.

While at the plant, Zelenskyy inscribed messages of gratitude on US bombs, including the phrase “Glory to Ukraine.” Democratic Governor Josh Shapiro, who was present during the signing, appeared supportive of the gesture. “Because you’re signing bombs that could potentially kill innocent people.

!loading <image:3679> There’s innocent on both sides.”

The backlash against Zelenskyy’s visit was further amplified by political commentators and Republican leaders. Reports indicate that Zelenskyy’s remarks about the Republican candidate for US vice president, whom he labeled as radical, only fueled this perception.

Senator Lindsey Graham, a prominent Republican figure, also condemned Zelenskyy's presence at the military plant, asserting that such actions could jeopardize Ukraine’s long-term objectives in its fight against Russia. “We need to ensure that incidents like this do not detract from the long-term goals of ensuring success for Ukraine,” Graham remarked.

The claim that Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed Israeli bombs intended for use against Palestinians in Gaza is false. According to the Eurovision News | Spotlight ([https://spotlight.ebu.ch/p/video-caption-falsely-claims-zelenskyy](https://spotlight.ebu.ch/p/video-caption-falsely-claims-zelenskyy)), the video shows Zelenskyy at a U.S. munitions factory signing artillery shells for Ukraine's war with Russia, not Israel's war in Gaza.

Volodymyr Zelensky (left) and Joe Biden said they would focus on Ukraine's "victory plan" at their White House talks

Volodymyr Zelensky is meeting Joe Biden and Kamala Harris at the White House to discuss his "victory plan", which the Ukrainian president hopes will pressure Russia into agreeing a diplomatic end to the war.

Details have been kept secret, but Zelensky is likely to ask the US president and vice-president for continuing military and financial support, as well as security guarantees.

It comes amid a row with Donald Trump and the Republican party ahead of November's US presidential election.

They were angered by Zelensky's visit to an arms factory in Biden's hometown of Scranton with top Democrats. Zelensky will meet Trump on Friday despite earlier reports that the meeting had been cancelled.

Zelensky's visit to the ammunition factory in the key swing state of Pennsylvania was labelled by leading Republicans as a partisan campaign event.

In a public letter, speaker of the US House Mike Johnson said the visit was "designed to help Democrats" and claimed it amounted to "election interference".

He also demanded that Ukraine fire its ambassador to Washington who helped arrange the visit.

The Republican-led House Oversight Committee has also announced it would investigate whether Zelensky's trip was an attempt to use a foreign leader to benefit Harris's campaign.

Her Republican rival for the presidency, Donald Trump, mocked Zelensky at a campaign event as the "greatest salesman on Earth" and accused him of refusing to "make a deal" with Moscow.

Earlier this week, Trump also praised Russia's military capabilities, saying: "They beat Hitler, they beat Napoleon - that’s what they do, they fight."

The two men have long had a fractious relationship. In 2019, Trump was impeached by the US House over accusations that he pressured Ukraine's leader to dig up damaging information on a political rival.

The row clouded a week in which Zelensky has twice addressed the United Nations, ramping up efforts to persuade the US and other allies to boost support more than two and a half years into Russia's full-scale invasion.

At the White House meetings, Zelensky is expected to push again for US backing to fire Western-made long-range missiles deep into Russian territory, which Biden has so far blocked.

Before the meeting, Biden said: "Let me be clear, Russia will not prevail in war... Ukraine will prevail".

He also pledged to support Kyiv "in its path to membership to both the EU and Nato".

Meanwhile, Zelensky thanked the US for its "unwavering bipartisan support".

He later met Harris, with the vice-president reiterating her support for Ukraine and arguing the US must continue its role of global leadership.

With Russian troops advancing in the east of Ukraine, the outcome of Zelensky's meeting with Biden and Harris is seen by many experts as a key moment in his attempt to shore up US support before the November election.

On Wednesday, Russia's Vladimir Putin announced a plan to revise Moscow's nuclear doctrine, to enable Russia to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states if they are supported by nuclear states.

Putin's spokesperson later clarified that it was meant as a "specific signal" to the West.

President Volodymyr Zelensky visited the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant alongside top Democrats on Friday

Hours before his meeting with Zelensky, Biden announced a $7.9bn (£5.9bn) package of military assistance to Ukraine.

The aid, part of a $61bn package that passed Congress in April, will be approved through presidential drawdown authority and will pull from existing Pentagon supplies to deliver the arms more quickly.

Congressional Republicans blocked the package for months earlier this year, before ultimately relenting and passing the legislation. The delay caused arms supplies to Ukraine to dry up for several months.

Zelensky thanked the US - Ukraine's largest foreign donor.

At the same time, he also reportedly expressed frustration at the delay in delivering weapons that were already promised when he met US congressmen on Thursday morning.

What was [Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky](https://nypost.com/2024/09/25/us-news/house-gop-accuses-kamala-harris-of-using-zelensky-as-campaign-surrogate-launches-foreign-interference-inquiry/)
 doing at what sure _looked_ like a partisan US political event this week?

And how did the White House let this happen?

Zelensky got flown into battleground Pennsylvania aboard a USAF C-17 plane on Tuesday; he then toured the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant accompanied by Gov. Josh Shapiro, Sen. Bob Casey, Rep. Matt Cartwright — the last two being active Democratic candidates.

And it looks like no GOP candidates got invited — trapping a foreign head of state into apparently taking sides in US domestic politics.

Yet Zelensky was guarded by Secret Service agents and driven around in Secret Service vehicles, adding more reek of impropriety: Who covered those expenses?

Someone in the Biden administration pulled a fast one: Pennsylvania has a fair number of anti-Russian Polish-Americans and others of Eastern European heritage who might be swayed by Zelensky’s seeming preference.

Legalities aside, this is terrible for Zelensky: Ukraine desperately needs support from Republicans as well as Democrats in Congress, and will no matter who holds the White House next year.

House Speaker Mike Johnson is calling on Zelensky to fire his US ambassador for letting this disgrace happen, a move that could mend _Ukraine’s_ fences here.

But Congress will need answers on the American side, too: After all, Democrats impeached President Donald Trump over _his_ supposed abuses linked to Ukraine; now we have the misuse of a foreign guest’s visit to influence US politics.

We absolutely endorse US support of Kyiv against Moscow’s brutal invasion: Vladimir Putin must not succeed.

And Democratic candidates have every right to slam those Republicans who want to hang Ukraine out to dry.

But dragging any foreign leader, _especially_ one who’s seeking now new support for his nation from the White House, into US politics is morally criminal — at least.

Whether at the White House or the State Department, _American_ heads need to roll over this."

Misleading claims targeting the German chancellor have been spreading online days before German voters head to the polls to elect a new government.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](https://static.euronews.com/website/images/logos/logo-euronews-stacked-outlined-72x72-grey-9.svg) ADVERTISEMENT

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has not ordered a state of emergency in Germany over the US’s bilateral peace negotiations with Russia, despite the claim spreading widely across social platforms.

Users on X, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok falsely accused Scholz of urging parliament to impose a state of emergency — known as "Notstand" in German — that would severely curtail citizens’ rights.

But a closer look at Scholz’s speech reveals he was referring to "Notlage", an entirely different concept in the German Basic Law that refers to an urgent situation, but which is not synonymous with a government-imposed state of emergency.

Speaking over the weekend as the Trump administration geared for talks with Russian officials in the Saudi Arabian capital, Riyadh, Scholz said: “The Bundestag should pass a resolution as soon as possible according to which the war in Ukraine and its serious consequences for the security of Germany and Europe are classified as an emergency (Notlage) within the meaning of Article 115 paragraph two of the Basic Law.”

The article referenced by Scholz states that natural disasters or “exceptional emergency situations” can justify changes to the country’s so-called debt brake, allowing the government to borrow beyond the credit limit.

**What is the debt brake and how could it be used to finance defence spending?**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Germany has strict limits on government borrowing, known as a debt brake. It’s aimed at restricting the budget deficit to less than 0.35% of the country’s annual gross domestic product (GDP).

The debt brake became legally binding for the government in 2016 and for the federal states in 2020.

In recent months, both Scholz’ Social Democrats (SPD) and the Greens have advocated for suspending the debt brake in response to the war in Ukraine and the ensuing energy crisis.

Scholz’s other coalition partners, the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP), fiercely opposed the move, contributing to a breakdown in trust that collapsed the three-way coalition government last November.

Scholz has said he expects the next government, which will be elected on Sunday, to trigger this article to ramp up its spending on defence and security.

The Christian Democrats’ Friedrich Merz, who is tipped to become the next German chancellor, has also expressed [**openness**](https://www.euronews.com/business/2025/02/10/chancellor-hopeful-merz-open-to-reform-of-germanys-debt-brake)
 to loosening the debt brake once other options have been exhausted.

This is despite a broad camp of his CDU party opposing any changes to Germany's strict borrowing limits.

**Misleading claims spread days before crunch vote**
----------------------------------------------------

The misleading claims targeting Scholz come days before German voters head to the ballot boxes to elect a new government.

The Conservative Christian Democrats (CDU/CSU) are poised to emerge as the biggest party and form a government, but could be forced to rely on the support of Scholz's Social Democratic Party to do so.

The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party is currently polling in second place.

There is concern that coordinated misinformation campaigns, including those engineered by the Kremlin, could put the integrity of the vote at risk.

A German non-profit has detected Russia's well-known "Doppelgänger" campaign resurfacing, cloning the websites of renowned media outlets by purchasing similar-looking domains to spread falsified news articles.

The European Commission has attempted to minimise risks by engaging with social media platforms, including in a roundtable in Berlin and a recent [**stress test**](https://www.euronews.com/next/2025/01/24/online-platforms-participate-in-stress-test-ahead-of-german-election)
 of their of their risk mitigation measures.

Author: [Kateryna Serohina](https://newsukraine.rbc.ua/author/kateryna-serohina.html)

The Bundestag should recognize the war in Ukraine as a state of emergency in terms of its consequences for Germany and Europe. Given the recent statements from representatives of the Trump administration, this issue can no longer be postponed, according to a [statement](https://x.com/Bundeskanzler/status/1890119800556339565)
 from the head of the government for the press.

According to Chancellor Olaf Scholz, the Bundestag must urgently pass a resolution classifying the war in Ukraine and its serious consequences for the security of Germany and Europe as a state of emergency under Article 115, paragraph 2 of the Constitution.

"As a result, our support for Ukraine, which is more crucial than ever, will no longer come at the expense of other tasks that our state must carry out for its citizens," the chancellor emphasized.

Scholz stressed that this is about the peace and security of our country. German Defense Minister Boris [Pistorius described these statements as concessions to Russia before negotiations even begin.](https://newsukraine.rbc.ua/news/german-defense-minister-warns-us-against-1739441277.html)

**Collective defense and security**
-----------------------------------

Chancellor Scholz also intends to advance the discussion within the EU on methods of investing in collective defense and building a powerful European defense industry.

He reminded that, at one point, he made serious decisions to decisively respond to the turning point marked by the start of Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine.

"Today, we find ourselves in a similar situation. I will not allow that to happen at this critical time for our country," the German leader promised.

**Controversial US plan to end the war in Ukraine**
---------------------------------------------------

US President Donald Trump held a telephone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 12.

Following the call, the White House stated that there was a good opportunity to end the war.

Subsequently, several Trump administration officials asserted that [Ukraine is unable to regain control of the territories occupied by Russia since 2014](https://newsukraine.rbc.ua/news/pentagon-chief-doubts-ukraine-can-return-1739370284.html)
. Today, we must confront the reality of what the actions and statements from the US administration mean for Ukraine, Europe, and the world. Failure to act will mean a threat to the security of our country and our continent. US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegset also acknowledged that Ukraine’s NATO membership should not be part of peace negotiations, while Trump rejected the idea of Ukraine joining the Alliance, stating that Russia will not allow it.

Many Western media outlets speculate that the direct conversation between Trump and Putin could indicate that the U.S."

BERLIN, Feb 13 (Reuters) - There must be no imposed peace in Ukraine and any solution to the conflict must involve the United States, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in an interview with Politico released on Thursday but conducted a day earlier.

"It is very clear to me that there must be no solution that does not also involve the U.S.," Scholz said.

As President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin prepare to [meet in Alaska](https://www.npr.org/2025/08/08/nx-s1-5347716/trump-putin-meeting)
 later this week, European leaders have stressed that Ukraine must be included in any talks with Russia over ending the war in Ukraine.

Leaders including French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said they welcome Trump's work to "stop the killing in Ukraine," but that the "path to peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without Ukraine."

"We are convinced that only an approach that combines active diplomacy, support to Ukraine and pressure on the Russian Federation to end their illegal war can succeed," the leaders wrote in a [joint statement](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/joint-leaders-statement-on-peace-for-ukraine)
 issued on Saturday.

The European leaders also stressed in their joint statement a need for "robust and credible security guarantees" that allow Ukraine to defend its territory.

Their statement follows a meeting that Vice President JD Vance and U.K. Vance said in an interview recorded before his overseas meeting that the meeting between Trump and Putin represents a "major breakthrough for American diplomacy."

"We're going to try to find some negotiated settlement that the Ukrainians and the Russians can live with where they can live in relative peace, where the killing stops," Vance told Maria Bartiromo in [an interview](https://www.foxnews.com/video/6376764434112)
 on Fox News' _Sunday Morning Futures._

"It's not going to make anybody super happy. "We're at a point now … we're now trying to figure out, frankly, scheduling and things like that, around when these three leaders could sit down and discuss an end to this conflict," he said, speaking about Trump, Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Zelenskyy has said he supports Trump's efforts to leverage a peace deal, but it is still unclear whether he will attend the meeting. Zelenskyy has maintained that Ukraine will not give up any land, and said it is up to Putin to end the war.

"The Ukrainian people deserve peace. Foreign Secretary David Lammy held with Ukrainian and European officials over the weekend in London.

Trump is set to meet with Putin on Friday in Alaska to discuss an end to the war. But all partners must understand what a dignified peace is. "Ukrainians will not gift their land to the occupier."

And that ends their press conference.

Separately, chancellor **Merz** also **pushed back against US president Donald Trump’s questioning the EU’s digital regulations**, stressing it was an expression of the bloc’s sovereignty.

“We are doing this in our own interest and solely for our own interest, and **we will certainly not be guided by statements that perhaps consider completely different**, perhaps even no, **regulation** **necessary** and important,” he said.

Germany’s **Merz** **warned in turn that the war could go on for “many months”** as he questioned Vladimir Putin’s commitments to progress the peace talks.

He pointed out that **the original discussion focused on hosting a bilateral summit between Putin and Zelenskyy within two weeks**, and yet **the Russian president remained “clearly unwilling” to follow through on this plan.**

“Frankly, **this doesn’t surprise me, because it’s part of the Russian president’s strategy to proceed in the same way,”** he said.

Instead, he stressed **the importance of working together within the Coalition of the Willing** and putting even more pressure on Russia to come to the table.

During the press conference, **Macron** also reiterated that **a just and lasting peace is only possible if [Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine)
 gets strong security guarantees.**

He added that **they both hoped that Russia’s Putin would move ahead with the bi- or trilateral meeting on ending the war**, as committed to in conversations with president Trump.

But **Macron warned that if Putin was to miss the Monday deadline, it would have been another example of him trying to “play” Trump**, which he said could not go unanswered, and should prompt further sanctions.

He indicated that both him and Merz could speak with Trump over the weekend.

Speaking at a joint press conference just now, **Emmanuel Macron** also **stressed the need for the two countries to work together on industrial and digital policies**, saying they would improve their digital sovereignty and competitiveness in “cutting-edge technologies.”

The president also said they were **determined to preserve the EU’s legislation on digital,** which can be seen as an indirect response to US president Donald Trump’s repeated comments expressing his frustration with the bloc’s rulebooks, which he sees as discriminating American technology.

He also signalled **France and Germany would work together more closely on other issues,** including the future of the automotive industry, steel, climate policies, and migration.

We are also getting first news lines from **Toulon**, where French president **Emmanuel Macron** and German chancellor **Friedrich Merz** attended the **25th Franco-German Council of Ministers**.

A joint statement from the meeting includes a **commitment to start what is called as “strategic dialogue” over nuclear deterrence and more broadly linking the two countries’ security policies,** agencies reported.

Importantly for Kyiv, it is also reported to **include a pledge to provide more air defence systems to [Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine)
,** adding that “despite intensive international diplomatic efforts, Russia shows no intention to end its war of aggression against Ukraine”.

EU spokesperson for foreign affairs **Anitta Hipper** said:

> _“The European External Action Service under the leadership of the HR/VP **has summoned the Chargé d’Affaires of the Russian mission** to the European Union, **Karen Malayan** yesterday._
> 
> _**Clear messages have been passed.**_
> 
> _Firstly, **Russian reckless attacks** resulted in the death of at least 23 people, including 4 children._
> 
> _Secondly, on the fact that **the damages to the EU Delegations are serious and constitute a violation of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.** Inviolability of diplomatic premises and personnel is to be respected in all cases._
> 
> _And thirdly, **the EU will not stop to support Ukraine.**_
> 
> _**Russia must stop killing and negotiate.”**_

Meanwhile, **Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s top aide, Andriy Yermak, met with US peace envoy Steve Witkoff in New York.**

Yermak said the meeting, which he attended together with Ukraine’s first deputy minister of foreign affairs **Serhii Kyslytsia**, was intended to **“push for real diplomacy and the implementation of all agreements of the Washington summit.”**

He said that the Ukrainian delegation **told Witkoff about “all the war crimes that [Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia)
 commits daily against our cities and communities,”** including Thursday’s attack on Kyiv, which killed 23 people.

“Unfortunately**, Russia is not doing anything necessary to end the war and is obviously prolonging the hostilities,”** he warned.

He told Witkoff that **Ukraine is “open to direct talks at the leadership level,”** ramping up further pressure on making the bi- or trilateral summit with Zelenskyy, Putin and potentially Trump happen in near future.

Yermak also said **he invited Witkoff to visit Ukraine “in the near future.”**

Given the domestic political context in France, with **François Bayrou’s** government widely expected to collapse next month, **Macron’s comments that he intends to serve out the rest of his term** are also making headlines.

\

**Colm McGivern**, the director of **the British Council in Ukraine**, said a security guard had been injured and **the cultural organisation’s headquarters had been “rendered unusable” by damage from Thursday’s Russian air strikes on Kyiv.**

**No evidence has emerged to suggest the council was deliberately targeted by Moscow,** though McGivern said “what I do know is that **Russia has targeted educational and cultural infrastructure in Ukraine repeatedly”**.

A neighbouring building in the city centure was struck at 5.40am and **the ensuing blast wave from the explosion blew out the British Council’s windows**, destroyed its ceilings and left its computers non functional, the director said.

Such was the damage that a security guard, on night watch was injured and hospitalised. No other employees were on the site at the time.

McGivern said that t**he 120 staff of the unit, 119 of whom are Ukrainian, had resolved to continue with the British Council’s cultural activities despite the loss of the premises for the foreseeable future**, including supporting the Kyiv International Short Film Festival next week.

“It was another night where Ukraine has been subject to a barbaric attack,” McGivern said. **“There is a palpable level of anger and colleagues are more determined than ever to do all they can,** to act on the things they can control, which is strengthen the relationship with the UK”.

_in Brussels_

Our Brussels correspondent **Jennifer Rankin** has asked the European Commission for more details about its summoning of the Russian charges d’affaires yesterday, after a Russian strike in Kyiv hit the EU delegation building and the British Council offices, among others.

 the Republican senators both to weaken the bill’s provisions and to delay its introduction. They are still heeding his request, but impatience is growing, as evidenced by a June 12 [statement](https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=511A8563-0D4C-4513-9131-467AAC383A3B)
 from US Senator Lindsay Graham (R-SC), the bill’s original sponsor. Trump’s posturing—floating the idea of sanctions even while he refrains from imposing them—helps the White House manage this pressure, but this can continue indefinitely.

Trump’s public musings on Russia also betray his unwillingness to take the strong steps that might persuade Putin to seriously negotiate. Last week, Trump characterized Russia and Ukraine as two brawling boys, rather than as aggressor and victim. This week, he [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG_JHaPMiZI)
 that he thought it strange that many American observers have a positive view of Japan and Germany, whom the United States fought in World War II, and a negative view of Russia, a US ally in that war—with no reference to Russia’s savage aggression in Ukraine or to the fact that Moscow considers the United States its principal adversary. 

As the latest two-week deadline passed this week with the Kremlin still firmly opposed to US peace proposals, Trump [commented](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/11/politics/trump-unresolved-foreign-conflicts)
 that Putin does not care about the human costs of war, but added that he was frustrated by both Russia and Ukraine.

While the president postures inconsistently, his administration is making decisions that disadvantage Ukraine. A case in point is the Defense Department’s decision to [divert](https://www.twz.com/news-features/counter-drone-weapons-diverted-from-ukraine-to-middle-east-amid-rising-tensions-hegseth-confirms)
 US counter-drone weapons from Ukraine to the Middle East. This decision was likely not taken with the goal of weakening Ukraine, but that was certainly the result. Such a decision can only be taken because the administration is not operating on the common-sense understanding that if it wants a durable peace in Ukraine, it must make it much harder for Putin to seize more of the country.

The Trump administration’s position in the preparation for the Group of Seven (G7) Summit in the coming days also highlights its peculiar interest in accommodating the Kremlin. The G7’s members have decided [not to release](https://www.npr.org/2025/06/12/nx-s1-5407560/trump-g7-canada)
 a joint communiqué, unlike last year, in part, I suspect, because previous G7 statements have included sharp criticism of Kremlin aggression. Herbst <image:9678>](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/trumps-russia-policy-must-be-rooted-in-realism/)

!Trump promised peace through strength. Taken together, these rhetorical and policy choices only encourage Russian President Vladimir Putin to continue his war of conquest and make it harder for Trump to reach his stated goal of establishing a durable peace in Ukraine.   

The painful reality is that the Kremlin does not want peace in Ukraine. The proof, of course, is that Russia has rejected multiple Trump peace proposals that Ukraine has accepted. Confronted by this, as early as April 24, Trump has acknowledged that Putin might be stalling and [said then](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/29/with-putin-trumps-decision-is-often-two-weeks-away-00374940)
, and again on April 27, that he would know in “two weeks” if that were so and, if so, he would put some form of pressure on Russia. 

Trump has been talking about a two-week deadline for nearly two months and has said on several occasions over this period that he might have to impose sanctions. The White House, meanwhile, has avoided language critical of the Kremlin since February in the G7, NATO, and the United Nations. 

Trump’s concessions to Russia on this language, his efforts to obscure the perception that Russia alone is blocking his peace initiative, and the decision to take weapons away from Ukraine have not made the Kremlin more reasonable. These measures only encourage Putin to expect that the United States will detach itself from Ukraine and that a Russian victory awaits. The Biden administration’s weakness in Afghanistan invited Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Trump promised peace through strength. When will he start to deliver?

Euronews published a fact-check on February 19, 2025, stating that Olaf Scholz did not declare a state of emergency in Germany due to US peace talks with Russia. The article clarifies that Scholz referred to "Notlage," an urgent situation, not a state of emergency ("Notstand") (<image:i>). RBC-Ukraine reported that Olaf Scholz proposed declaring a state of emergency in Germany due to the war in Ukraine. Reuters reported on February 13, 2025, that Scholz said there must be no imposed peace in Ukraine, mentioning discussions between Trump, Putin, and Zelenskyy (<image:9657>).

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is not accurate. Evidence indicates that Olaf Scholz did not declare a state of emergency ("Notstand") in February 2025 due to Donald Trump's peace plan. Instead, Scholz referred to an urgent situation ("Notlage") and proposed declaring a state of emergency due to the war in Ukraine.

Furthermore, the evidence suggests that in August 2025, Friedrich Merz was the German Chancellor, not Olaf Scholz.

## Actions

web_search("Donald Trump peace plan Ukraine Germany")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Euronews published a fact-check on February 19, 2025, stating that Olaf Scholz did not declare a state of emergency in Germany due to US peace talks with Russia. The article clarifies that Scholz referred to "Notlage," an urgent situation, not a state of emergency ("Notstand") (<image:i>). RBC-Ukraine reported that Olaf Scholz proposed declaring a state of emergency in Germany due to the war in Ukraine. Reuters reported on February 13, 2025, that Scholz said there must be no imposed peace in Ukraine, mentioning discussions between Trump, Putin, and Zelenskyy (<image:9657>).

### Evidence from `web_search`
NPR published an article on August 10, 2025, discussing a meeting between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska to discuss ending the war in Ukraine. European leaders, including German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, are urging for Ukraine to be included in the talks (<image:k>). The Guardian reported on August 29, 2025, that French President Macron and German Chancellor Merz attended the 25th Franco-German Council of Ministers, which included a pledge to provide more air defense systems to Ukraine. The article also mentions Donald Trump's comments on EU digital regulations were pushed back by Merz (<image:9660>, <image:9662>, <image:9667>).

The Atlantic Council published an article on June 5, 2025, discussing Donald Trump's approach to the war in Ukraine, mentioning his reluctance to take strong steps against Russia and decisions that disadvantage Ukraine (<image:9678>, <image:9676>, <image:9677>).


## Elaboration
The claim is not accurate. Evidence indicates that Olaf Scholz did not declare a state of emergency ("Notstand") in February 2025 due to Donald Trump's peace plan. Instead, Scholz referred to an urgent situation ("Notlage") and proposed declaring a state of emergency due to the war in Ukraine.

Furthermore, the evidence suggests that in August 2025, Friedrich Merz was the German Chancellor, not Olaf Scholz.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is false because Olaf Scholz did not declare a state of emergency in February 2025 due to Donald Trump's peace plan. Also, the German Chancellor in August 2025 was Friedrich Merz, not Olaf Scholz. `false`

 appears to feature an audio recording of US President Donald Trump criticising the UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer over aid to Ukraine, energy costs and jobs.

But the audio has been generated by AI and overlaid onto a [video interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g)
 Mr Trump did with podcaster Theo Von on 21 August 2024.

Neither Mr Trump or Mr Von discuss the UK or Ukraine in this video, but instead focus on US healthcare reform, border security and President Trump’s reasons for avoiding drinking and smoking.

**How did we know this was AI-generated?**

We contacted Professor **Hany Farid**, who specialises in digital forensics at the University of California, Berkeley, and is Chief Science Officer at GetReal Labs, a cybersecurity company focused on preventing malicious threats from generative AI.

The Ukrainian general story first emerged on a pro-Russian Telegram channel four days after the fires started in Los Angeles. Some of the posts amplifying the baseless claim falsely credited it to United24 Media, a website affiliated with the Ukrainian government.

The Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council's Center for Countering Disinformation issued a [statement](https://x.com/CforCD/status/1878381491056501245)
 describing the claim as "Russian propaganda." It said it had verified with United24 Media that it did not create or share the story.

NPR has not obtained evidence that any Ukrainian generals owned homes in Los Angeles that were destroyed by the fires. Both @OlgaBazova and Patterson's posts received user-generated community notes on X citing the Greek fact check.

The unverified claim about the alleged Ukrainian-owned mansions also appeared on other social media platforms including Tik Tok, TruthSocial and the Russian site VK, but did not gain much traction.

The story is the latest example of Russia's shift away from using fake social media profiles impersonating real people, as it did during the 2016 and 2020 U.S. Accounts tied to previous China influence operations spread false claims about the fire's origins.

While the story about Ukrainian officials got more traction than the other narratives about the fires originating from Russia-allied channels, Linvill said, it has not yet spread as widely as previous narratives linked to Russia."

MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:

And now to California, where firefighters in Los Angeles are making progress getting those massive wildfires under control. Both @OlgaBazova and Patterson's posts received user-generated community notes on X citing the Greek fact check.

The unverified claim about the alleged Ukrainian-owned mansions also appeared on other social media platforms including Tik Tok, TruthSocial and the Russian site VK, but did not gain much traction.

The story is the latest example of Russia's shift away from using fake social media profiles impersonating real people, as it did during the 2016 and 2020 U.S. Accounts tied to previous China influence operations spread false claims about the fire's origins.

While the story about Ukrainian officials got more traction than the other narratives about the fires originating from Russia-allied channels, Linvill said, it has not yet spread as widely as previous narratives linked to Russia. So this particular narrative, what it alleges is that mansions of eight Ukrainian generals were amongst the homes destroyed."

!Briefing Of The Commander-In-Chief Of The Armed Forces Of Ukraine Valerii Zaluzhnyi <image:2342>

General Valerii Zaluzhnyi was among those reported to have a home in Los Angeles, even though he lives in London now as Ukraine's ambassador to the UK. The Russian propaganda effort is thus to encourage support for the war at home while making those in the West question any aid that has been sent to Kyiv.

"People predisposed to believing narratives like this will take it to be another 'false' datapoint of corruption and largesse in the Ukrainian military, and at the same time, a sweet act of karma that these imaginary mansions are burning to the ground," said Schmidt. The total value of these properties amounts to $90 million and was allegedly purchased with funds provided by the West as part of economic aid to Kyiv after the war began."

Subsequent posts [named Valerii Zaluzhnyi](https://t.me/naspravdiinfo/104501 "https://t.me/naspravdiinfo/104501")
, former Ukrainian four-star general and current ambassador of Ukraine to the United Kingdom, as being among those who have lost their homes.

Satire, But Really Disinformation
---------------------------------

The initial post on Telegram did indeed include the hashtag "сатира" (Russian for satire), but subsequent reposts lacked any mention that it was made in jest. Yet, even as "satire," it isn't clear where the humor lies in the original post, except possibly to Russian audiences who might find joy that any Ukrainian would see their home burns down in the devastating California fires.

"There is zero evidence that any Ukrainian generals own any property in L.A., much less mansions," said Dr. It's not just about the misinformation – it's about how quickly it crosses platforms and gains traction."

Disinformation Fits An Existing Narrative
-----------------------------------------

All of these disinformation campaigns have a common thread – they're based on the unsubstantiated belief that Ukrainian officials are getting rich while the war continues. Matthew Schmidt, professor of national security and political science at the University of New Haven.

Humor likely wasn't even the point, and instead, the channels posting the claims likely wanted it to be believed as fact – much like the news last summer that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spent $15 million to [buy a Mercedes 770 automobile](https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2024/10/09/despite-online-claims-ukraines-zelensky-didnt-buy-hitlers-car/ "https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2024/10/09/despite-online-claims-ukraines-zelensky-didnt-buy-hitlers-car/")
 that was previously owned by Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler, or that Zelensky's wife purchased a [Bugatti sports car](https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2024/07/02/social-media-posts-claim-zelenskys-wife-spent-millions-on-bugatti-sportscar/ "https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2024/07/02/social-media-posts-claim-zelenskys-wife-spent-millions-on-bugatti-sportscar/")

You are provided with the record of a fact-check. It contains the Claim to be verified and a documentation of all the fact-checking work along the gathered evidence. Your task is to **summarize the fact-check**. That is, you provide a concise, one-paragraph justification for the final VERDICT based on the knowledge from the Record. Note:
* Be truthful, brief, do not add any additional information besides the information given in the Record. 
* Link key sources in your summary. Use Markdown notation for that. You may link them in-line.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "During the January 2025 wildfires, eight mansions belonging to Ukrainian military officials burned down in Los Angeles, California."

## Actions
```
web_search("January 2025 wildfires Los Angeles Ukrainian military officials mansions")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Pro-Kremlin social media accounts spread a baseless narrative that mansions belonging to Ukrainian military officials burned down in the Los Angeles wildfires. This claim was debunked by fact-checkers from Greece and the United States. The Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council's Center for Countering Disinformation described the claim as "Russian propaganda." The story first emerged on a pro-Russian Telegram channel and was later reposted without any mention of it being a joke. There is zero evidence to support this claim. <image:2335>, <image:2342>

The claim is part of a disinformation campaign based on the unsubstantiated belief that Ukrainian officials are getting rich while the war continues. NPR has not obtained evidence that any Ukrainian generals owned homes in Los Angeles that were destroyed by the fires.

A post [shared on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=3936628693283593&id=100008095036730)
 claims billionaire Elon Musk posted a “last dollar” for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

**Verdict: False**

There is no evidence that Musk posted this.

**Fact Check:**

Musk joined President-elect Donald Trump on his phone call with Zelenskyy, according to [The Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-ukraine-elon-musk-zelenskyy-starlink-f6ab0c5e1c5de1262ae2a1747247819c)
. Musk has become a part of Trump’s inner circle, the outlet reported.

Social media users are claiming that Musk posted that Zelenskyy had received his “last dollar.” These claims show an image of a purported tweet from Musk, which states, “The last dollar for Zelenskiy” and is accompanied by a dollar with Trump in the middle.

These claims are false. If he had done so, media outlets would have covered it, yet [none have](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=14c9acc35e76766d&q=musk+last+dollar+for+zelenskyy&tbm=nws&source=lnms&fbs=AEQNm0Aa4sjWe7Rqy32pFwRj0UkWtG_mNb-HwafvV8cKK_h1a5eSkyfXNgRC6a9SKsMT7FKel2oEVH7CAeL9GJLZ9zSE1b0VTwOacLkI4XgtHWeWNmKPMmJVT-fsL2j8HgVBOedFE0rcv3l9ce7iX7VQHiBT41qOitP2uFNPJwqo3Nj1J21-Gh5tg3bNyqf1kLEJ7mR0Orp4LTigYJIGRfW985SFZs7PWg&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjKqs7Mt9eJAxU8GFkFHTF9LuMQ0pQJegQIEhAB&biw=1440&bih=812&dpr=2)

From [Source](https://www.politico.eu/article/billionaire-elon-musk-mocks-ukraine-president-zelenskyy-asking-aid-with-meme/): 
Content: "[Skip to main content](#main)

Billionaire entrepreneur [Elon Musk mocked Ukraine’s war-time leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1708629197617336398)
 on Monday, using a meme to scoff at the president’s calls for Western aid.

“When it’s been 5 min and you haven’t asked for a billion dollars in aid,” read Musk’s message, which accompanied Zelenskyy’s head attached to a famous photo of an agitated schoolboy, who — according to the [meme’s etymology](https://medium.com/@tazreen.noman/the-origin-of-michael-mcgee-vein-popping-guy-ad41c63190f0)
 — was in a classroom and desperately trying to hold in flatulence.

Musk has had a troubled relationship with Ukrainians and the country’s administration since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion in February 2022, but now they’ve had just about enough of the SpaceX chief and owner of X (formerly Twitter).

“So you have bought social media to bully people who are dying because \[they\] love freedom,” Ukrainian stand-up comedian Anton Tymoshenko [wrote](https://twitter.com/_Tymoshenko/status/1708716338196214196)
 in response to Musk’s post.

“Elon, did you write this meme during a friendly conversation with Putin on the phone?” another Ukrainian comic and volunteer, Vasyl Baydak, [wrote](https://twitter.com/by_by_duck/status/1708711638268878922)
 — alluding to a [New Yorker report](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/08/28/elon-musks-shadow-rule)
 that Musk and the Russian president spoke directly.

Even Ukrainian media organizations joined the anti-Musk revolt, with top publication Ukrainska Pravda [posting](https://twitter.com/pravda_eng/status/1708732658182701406?s=20)
 the same meme, but with Musk’s face photoshopped in, saying: “When’s it’s been 5 minutes and you haven’t spread Russian propaganda.”

Zelenskyy has not yet reacted to Musk’s post. But that narrative flipped after he began spreading what Ukraine said was [pro-Russian propaganda](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/03/ukrainian-officials-and-allies-rail-against-elon-musk-tweet-00060085)
 via his social media.

According to a new biography of the tech boss, Musk also secretly ordered his engineers to [disable Starlink satellite](https://www.politico.eu/article/elon-musk-ukraine-starlink-russia-crimea-war-drone-submarine-attack-sabotage/)
 communications near the coast of Russian-occupied Crimea last year to sabotage a planned Ukrainian drone strike.

Last week, the [European Commission slammed Musk’s X](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_NCu44_Xc0)
 as the social media platform which is the biggest source of disinformation. President Joe Biden [signed](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/09/30/biden-administration-congress-government-shutdown-deal-ukraine-aid-00119296)
 a temporary budget bill featuring no Ukraine aid to avert the American government’s shutdown.

Shortly after Putin’s assault on Kyiv began last year, Musk was hailed in Ukraine thanks to his early decision to provide Starlink satellite internet for the country. But one of his office advisers, Serhiy Leshchenko, hit back [in a tweet](https://twitter.com/Leshchenkos/status/1708720295681421701)
 accusing Musk of “trolling.”

Musk’s meme comes shortly after U.S."

Content: "© X / @elonmusk

Read more[Elon Musk’s tweets (2/2): Raising the profile of Europe’s far right](https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20250430-elon-musk-tweets-europe-far-right-us-boost)

On October 2, 2023, more than a year before Donald Trump’s re-election, Elon Musk shared a meme on his social media platform X that mocked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, depicting him as a petulant teen. 

“When it’s been 5 minutes and you haven’t asked for a billion dollars in aid,” reads the text on the image, showing Zelensky looking sulky. 

The caricature is meant to mock Ukraine’s requests for financial assistance from the United States to help with the war in Ukraine, requests which Musk believes are too frequent and too demanding. 

 ![Légende: Above is a caricature of Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky created by a Russian propaganda agency. The image was [produced by](https://www.france.tv/france-2/complement-d-enquete/7065050-guerres-de-propagande-la-france-en-premiere-ligne.html)
 the Social Design Agency (SDA), a Russian agency that the Russian government pays to create influence operations and cause unrest, according to an investigation by [Complément d’Enquête](https://x.com/tristanwaleckx/status/1912803601694568795)
, a show on French television channel France 2. 

While there is no indication that SDA directed Musk to retweet the image, the fact that he did massively amplified the meme’s reach: it garnered more than 95 million views on his X account.  

To study Musk’s messaging on X, teams from the FRANCE 24 Observers, French media outlet France Info, and Belgian media outlet RTBF analysed around 15,000 posts shared by Elon Musk between November 4, 2024, and April 4, 2025, as part of a project through the Public French-speaking Media association ([Médias Francophones Publics](https://www.lesmediasfrancophones.org/)
).  

In order to analyse all of these tweets, we created a computer program based on ChatGPT’s artificial intelligence (see the sidebar at the end of the article). 

This enabled us to identify the hundreds of tweets that make up Elon Musk's anti-Ukraine rhetoric. Shortly after, Russian President Vladimir Putin threatened to use nuclear weapons if Ukraine hit Russia with long-range missiles

For his part, Musk expressed himself on X on [November 19](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1858873944327020864)
 ([archive](https://archive.ph/15B8C)
), approving the reactions of American political figures who were criticising the supply of missiles, such as those of Republican Ohio Senator Bernie Moreno who said that “Biden dramatically escalated the war” and Donald Trump Junior who wrote that “the American people want peace, not endless war!” In the days around November 17, Musk published 27 posts supporting Russia or criticising Ukraine. 

 ![This graph shows Musk’s tweets that are either pro-Russia or hostile to Ukraine that he posted between November 2024 and April 2025.](https://s.france24.com/media/display/c6b274e0-2515-11f0-987e-005056bfb2b6/w:980/graph-1-EN.png)

This graph shows Musk’s tweets that are either pro-Russia or hostile to Ukraine that he posted between November 2024 and April 2025. The meeting ended in a clash, with the Americans claiming that Zelensky wasn’t showing enough gratitude for the US aid provided to Ukraine.  

Musk published 138 posts related to this turbulent visit, sharing the highlights (or in this case lowlights) of the clash along with commentary, including when Zelensky’s [choice of clothing](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1895524314797220118)
 ([archive](https://archive.ph/jc3DQ)
) was criticised, when [Trump](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1895532321450967266)
 ([archive](https://archive.ph/xFtOW)
) claimed Zelensky was “gambling with World War III”, when Vance told Zelensky he was being disrespectful and when Republican Senator [Lindsay Graham](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1895582702923067837)
 ([archive](https://archive.ph/qMzxc)
) called for Zelensky to step down after the visit. © X / @elonmusk, FRANCE 24 Observers, MFP

Many of Musk’s posts directly criticise Zelensky.

”Elon Musk is picking up Putin’s narrative against the Ukrainian president,” says Jérôme Viala-Gaudefroy, who has a doctorate in American civilisation and wrote the book “Trump’s words” ("Les mots de Trump" published by Dalloz.). Sack joined the Trump administration last December to work on issues relating to artificial intelligence and crypto money. 

Musk is also in contact with figures reputed to have close connections with Russia like Mario Nawfal, a Lebanese-Australian influencer who is known for having interviewed Belarusian President [Alexander Lukachenko](https://x.com/AmbassadeBLR/status/1897202102830518722/)
, a close Putin ally, and Ian Miles Cheong, a Malaysian influencer who used to write for [Russia Today](https://time.com/6694681/ian-miles-cheong-malaysia-execution-internet-trending-israel/)
.

“Elon Musk doesn’t explicitly boost pro-Kremlin accounts,” Jessica Yarin Robinson explains. Thank you, [@KGawkowski](https://x.com/KGawkowski)
 \[Editor’s note: Krzysztof Gawkowski, the Polish minister of digital affairs\] and Poland,” Musk tweeted, clearly pleased to have patched things up with his clients. 

_To study Musk’s messaging on X, teams from the France 24 Observers and Belgian broadcaster RTBF analysed and categorised more than 15,000 tweets and retweets shared by his account (@elonmusk) between November 4, 2024 and April 4, 2025._ 

_In order to analyse all of these tweets, we used a method created by researchers in cognitive science at the French higher education institute l__'É__cole Normale supérieure (for more on the method click_ [_here_](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/artificial-intelligence/articles/10.3389/frai.2024.1365508/full)
_), which allowed us to catagorise text using the ChatGPT language model._

_We asked ChatGPT’s API to categorise each tweet, which enabled us to identify all of the tweets that Musk shared that were either hostile to Ukraine or favorable to Russia, as well as those that criticised Europe and those that showed support for the European far right._ 

_We verified the results by manually analysing each post._  

_We examined Musk’s original posts, as well as the posts he shared (such as his retweets or quote tweets). We also included the transcripts of videos that he posted directly or shared from other accounts._

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

The same image was found on Etsy ([https://www.etsy.com/ie/listing/1407539034/custom-dollar-dollar-bill-art-100-dollar](https://www.etsy.com/ie/listing/1407539034/custom-dollar-dollar-bill-art-100-dollar)) as a custom dollar bill art. The image was also found on Redbubble ([https://www.redbubble.com/shop/one+dollar+stickers](https://www.redbubble.com/shop/one+dollar+stickers)) as a sticker. <image:2384>, <image:2385>, <image:2386>, <image:2387>, <image:2388>, <image:2389>, <image:2390>, <image:2391>, <image:2392>, <image:2393>, <image:2394>, <image:2405>, <image:19>


## Elaboration
The claim is false. The AOL article states that the image is fake. The reverse image search shows that the image is a custom dollar bill art and a sticker.


## Final Judgement
The image is a custom dollar bill art and a sticker, and the AOL article states that the image is fake. Therefore, the claim is not factually accurate. `false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is false. The image of the tweet is a custom dollar bill art and a sticker, and an article from AOL ([https://www.aol.com/fact-check-elon-musk-didn-164103080.html](https://www.aol.com/fact-check-elon-musk-didn-164103080.html)) states that the image is fake.

US President Donald Trump is focused on peace and has made unprecedented progress in the negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, US Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard told NDTV in an exclusive conversation today.

Here are the top 10 quotes by Tulsi Gabbard:
--------------------------------------------

1. "Trump remains very committed to combating and defeating the threat of Islamist terrorism. "Trump is also taking action where the previous administration failed. So, President Trump has taken a decisive action for our own safety, security, and prosperity."
    

8. "President Trump is seeing this ongoing conflict with very clear eyes. "Under the previous administration, there was no effort at all towards peace or direct dialogue with Putin to bring an end to this war. So, in a very short period of time, Trump has made much more progress towards peace than any other previous effort. The talks are just beginning between Trump's incoming cabinet and the Bangladesh government, but this continues to remain a central focus area of concern."

"I'm sure that President Trump will have a very productive conversation with Putin, once again, rooted in his unwavering commitment to peace."

In the same interview, **Gabbard** also hailed Trump's relationship with Indian Prime Minister [Narendra Modi](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/narendra-modi)
: "With President Trump's leadership in the United States, of course Prime Minister Modi's longstanding leadership here in India, we have two leaders of our two great countries who are very good friends and who are very focused on how we can strengthen those shared objectives and those shared interests."

U.S. That prompted Zelensky to say he was ready to sign a rare earth minerals deal that the Trump administration has pushed for in exchange for continued aid to Ukraine.

Last week, Ukraine agreed to the U.S.'s proposal for a 30-day ceasefire, subject to the Kremlin's agreement.

 and said Trump’s push for both sides to agree to a ceasefire comes from an “unwavering commitment to peace.”

“Under the previous administration, during which this war began, there was no effort, there was no effort at all towards peace.

“With President Trump’s leadership in the United States, of course Prime Minister Modi’s longstanding leadership here in India, we have two leaders of our two great countries who are very good friends and who are very focused on how we can strengthen those shared objectives and those shared interests.”

CNN  — 

Vice President JD Vance warned on Thursday that the United States could hit Russia with economic and military “tools of leverage” if Russian leader Vladimir Putin doesn’t negotiate a peace deal with Ukraine in good faith.

Speaking to the Wall Street Journal on Thursday, Vance said the option of sending US troops to Ukraine was “on the table,” as well as economic punishment if a peace deal doesn’t guarantee Kyiv’s long-term independence.

“There are economic tools of leverage, there are of course military tools of leverage,” Vance told the newspaper.

His comments strike a different tone from other recent statements from the White House – including from US President Donald Trump who [suggested this week](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/11/europe/ukraine-russia-trump-zelensky-intl/index.html)
 that Ukraine “may be Russian someday,” shortly before announcing that peace negotiations would begin immediately after holding a phone call with Putin.

Vance’s statement also contrasts with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who has said the US would no longer prioritize European and Ukrainian security. (AP Photo/Alex Babenko)\

The Wall Street Journal interview was published before Vance was set to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the high-level Munich Security Conference in Germany.

On arrival in Munich Vance said NATO remains an important alliance for the United States.

“Europe is of course a very important ally to the United States, NATO is a very important military alliance … but we want to make sure NATO is actually built for the future, and part of that is ensuring that NATO does a little bit more burden-sharing in Europe so the United States can focus on some of our challenges in East Asia,” Vance said, speaking to reporters beside NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte.

 may be struck with Putin to end the war on terms favorable to Moscow without Kyiv’s involvement.

Many in Europe were shocked Trump appeared to make key concessions to Moscow before even agreeing to peace talks. [](#maincontent)

Volodymyr Zelenskyy, president of Ukraine speaks to the press during a media briefing on the territory of Khmelnytskyi Nuclear Power Plant, Ukraine, Thursday, Feb. This week, he told NATO allies that European and non-European troops – but not Americans – would have to police any agreement between Ukraine and Russia.

CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.

[![Volodymyr Zelenskyy, president of Ukraine speaks to the press during a media briefing on the territory of Khmelnytskyi Nuclear Power Plant, Ukraine, Thursday, Feb. His and Hegseth’s comments also threw into question the future of NATO’s future unity, resources and funding, a cornerstone of European security since the Second World War.

There was also surprise that Trump spoke to Putin before speaking to Zelensky, with European leaders on Thursday scrambling to make clear any peace deal would have to involve Ukraine at the heart of negotiations.

After Trump’s announcement of the peace deal negotiations, French President Emmanuel Macron also described his return to the White House as an “electroshock” for Europe in an interview with the Financial Times.

Macron underlined the need for Europe to strengthen its economy and defenses, agreeing with Trump’s stance that Ukraine’s security was a European responsibility. 13, 2025. 13, 2025. But he also emphasized that only Ukraine could negotiate for itself, and that any peace that was a “capitulation” would be bad news for everyone.

Content: "could hit Moscow with sanctions and potential military action if Russian President Vladimir Putin does not agree to a peace deal with Ukraine that guarantees Kyiv's long-term independence, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday.

Vance also agreed that Trump might change his mind depending on how the negotiations unfold.

“President Trump could say, look, we don’t want this thing, we might not like this thing, but we’re willing to put it back on the table if the Russians aren’t being good negotiating partners, or there are things that are very important to Ukrainians that we might want to take off the table,” he said.

Feb 13 (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President JD Vance said the U.S. does not see NATO membership for Kyiv as part of a solution.

Ukrainians on Thursday worried that Trump was preparing to sell out their country following his phone call Putin.

Earlier in the day, Trump said that Ukraine would be involved in [peace talks with Russia](/world/eu-warns-against-dirty-deal-ukraine-after-trump-putin-phone-call-2025-02-13/)
. He told reporters at the White House that Ukraine would have a seat at the table during any peace negotiations with Russia over ending the war.

Kyiv said it would be premature to speak with Moscow at a security conference on Friday.

“I think there is a deal that is going to come out of this that’s going to shock a lot of people,” the newspaper quoted Vance as saying.

"The president is not going to go in this with blinders on,” Vance said."

[!Russia Notes US Hypocrisy in California Fire Case <image:4830>](/en/news/2025/01/12/3236714/russia-notes-us-hypocrisy-in-california-fire-case)

### TEHRAN (Tasnim) - Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova commented on reports that hundreds of prisoners have been mobilized to extinguish fires in the US state of California, pointing to the hypocrisy of the US.

[\- Other Media news -](/en/service/1200/other-media)

Earlier, The Washington Post, citing the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, reported that the state authorities had sent 395 prisoners to fight forest fires. The diplomat noted that in 2023, Washington restricted imports of products from several Chinese companies in an attempt to exclude goods allegedly produced with the help of Uygur forced labor from the US supply chain.

"This raises a logical question: will Congress draft a bill imposing sanctions on California authorities, private companies, and ordinary Americans for using prison labor to put out fires?" she wondered. "We are so sick of this hypocrisy!" Zakharova added.

Wildfires began to spread across Los Angeles County on January 7."

Did Russia offer sanctuary to California residents who lost their homes in the Los Angeles fires? A viral X [post](https://x.com/jacksonhinklle/status/1879042008465183185)
 by Jackson Hinkle—a [regular purveyor](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/11/business/media/jackson-hinkle-israel-gaza-misinformation.html)
 of Russia-related misinformation—claims so.

“BREAKING: RUSSIA has offered shelter & sanctuary to Californians whose livelihoods were DESTROYED in the LA wildfires,” reads the post, which had more than 500,000 views on X as of January 15.

Assessing Claims That Russia Offered Sanctuary to California Fire Victims
=========================================================================

One Russian governor did make an offer, but there are some caveats.

! A single Russian governor said that he would welcome California fire victims to the region of occupied Ukraine he oversees, but only if they don’t support the government in Kyiv.

On Monday, Vladimir Saldo, the governor of the Russian-occupied Kherson oblast region of Ukraine, [told](https://tass.ru/obschestvo/22867057)
 _TASS_—a Russian state-controlled media outlet—that the region would accept any Americans who lost their homes in this month’s California fires. “Despite the ongoing, blatantly anti-Russian policy of the United States, we fully understand that natural disasters don’t care who you are or what you do,” Saldo said, [according to](https://www.rt.com/russia/610836-california-fires-sanctuary-kherson/)
 Russia Today, a Russian state-controlled network that translated the statement into English. Therefore, our region is ready to welcome any American citizen who has lost their home and livelihood.”

That offer comes with a caveat, applying only to Californians who haven’t supported Ukraine since Russia invaded its borders in February 2022. Sutton")

Other Russian Telegram channels are also spreading false or unverified narratives about the southern California fires and the government's response, as well as amplifying critiques from Americans including the president-elect's son, Donald Trump, Jr., Andy Carvin of the Atlantic Council's DFRLab told NPR in an email. The Russian news site [Pravda](https://web.archive.org/web/20250115205032/https://news-pravda.com/world/2025/01/08/963104.html)

"Over the last week, Pravda has published at least 350 stories of this type \[based on Telegram messages about the fires\], based on our initial content analysis of the site," Carvin said.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that Russia commented on the California wildfires in January 2025. Maria Zakharova made comments, and Vladimir Saldo offered sanctuary to fire victims. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Russia offered assistance for the wildfires. The NPR article mentions that pro-Kremlin social media accounts spread a false narrative about the wildfires.

Therefore, the claim is not directly supported by the evidence. The evidence suggests that Russia was involved in the discussion and offered sanctuary, but not assistance.

To verify the claim, information about any specific offers of assistance from Russia is missing.

Last week, devastating wildfires ignited across Los Angeles County in what is one of the most destructive natural disasters in US history. But as firefighters continue to battle the flames, false and misleading information about the disaster [has spread](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/10/rightwing-misinformation-los-angeles-fire)
 just as quickly on social media. While much of the false information seemingly originated from users in the United States, Russian state-affiliated accounts also leveraged the California wildfires and narratives reverberating among certain segments of the US public to sow division, undermine trust in relief efforts, and reduce public support for Ukraine.  

**Diverting Resources to Ukraine** 

Amid the destructive wildfires in Los Angeles, Russian government officials and state-affiliated media have propagated narratives critical of the Biden administration and other Democratic leaders to aggravate political division, particularly on Ukraine, and to denigrate the United States. Russian-state controlled outlet Sputnik further [mocked](https://x.com/Sputnik_India/status/1879127371049001320)
 Biden’s emergency relief payments to victims of the wildfires, claiming that they receive less daily per capita than people in Ukraine and Israel.  

Russian state-controlled media outlets further [honed in](https://sputnikglobe.com/20250109/california-wildfires-unexpected-links-to-us-green-lobby-and-ukraine-1121391704.html)
 [on reports](https://x.com/SputnikInt/status/1877282105815597399)
 that the Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) donated surplus equipment to Ukraine in 2022 [to suggest](https://x.com/SputnikInt/status/1877345987468882396)
 that those donations [created a lack of](https://x.com/RT_com/status/1877126472915128820)
 resources to fight fires. Additionally, Russian state media seized on the fires to fuel divides on other partisan policy issues, linking the fires to the “[green lobby](https://sputnikglobe.com/20250109/california-wildfires-unexpected-links-to-us-green-lobby-and-ukraine-1121391704.html)
” and [blaming](https://x.com/RT_com/status/1877151147703562608)
 the firefighter shortage on COVID-19 vaccine mandates.

**Amplifying** **AI-Generated Content**

In at least one case, Russian state media amplified a misleading image generated by artificial intelligence (AI). Other Russian-language media outlets subsequently spread the image. 

**Conclusion** 

Kremlin-affiliated accounts have leveraged the California wildfires to further advance Russia’s geopolitical agenda. In a press conference on January 14, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov [claimed](https://x.com/SputnikInt/status/1879100711361016212)
 the estimated $250 billion worth of damage sustained from the California fires is comparable to the amount Washington “pumped into Ukraine”. Russia’s messaging on the wildfires further underlines a trend of autocratic states [exploiting natural disasters](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/investigations/russia-china-cuba-amplified-falsehoods-recent-hurricanes-us-official-s-rcna177672)
 to advance their geopolitical goals. This approach keeps with Russia’s now [longstanding strategy](https://securingdemocracy.gmfus.org/a-year-of-disinformation-russia-and-chinas-influence-campaigns-during-the-war-in-ukraine/)
 to dent US support for Ukraine by playing to pocketbook issues and perceptions that domestic issues have received less attention than foreign ones. 

![](/sites/default/files/inline-images/rt%201.png)

**Blaming DEI**

Accounts affiliated with Russia echoed narratives prominent among American audiences that claim diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives hindered wildfire recovery efforts. Russian state-controlled media outlet RT [accused](https://x.com/RT_com/status/1876870822637248582)
 LAFD Chief Kristen Crowly—the first woman and openly gay person to serve in the role—of prioritizing DEI initiatives at the expense of preventing fires. Sputnik also [posted](https://x.com/SputnikInt/status/1877278684240859332)
 a local news clip of a California resident who claimed that “gay people” were the cause of the fires."

MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:

And now to California, where firefighters in Los Angeles are making progress getting those massive wildfires under control. Now, NPR has learned that Russia is using the fires to advance anti-Ukraine propaganda as part of its war against that country. So far, there's no evidence that it happened, and the Ukrainian government has denied it to NPR, but researchers say that it is part of a bigger narrative that Russia has pushed for years. Pro-Russian accounts regularly claim that various Ukrainian officials own luxury goods overseas, like yachts, villas and, in one case, a sports car. The underlying idea is that Ukrainian government is corrupt and does not deserve foreign aid, which it is currently receiving for its war with Russia. How did it spread?

HUO: So fact-checkers traced this narrative to pro-Russian Telegram channels. A lot of these accounts and websites have a history of either being a part of or echoing known Russian-influenced operations. Darren Linvill is a professor at Clemson University and codirects its media forensics lab.

DARREN LINVILL: It's just so typical of what we see from Russia and so despicable to take advantage of an ongoing crisis for their own ends.

HUO: You know, aside from undermining Ukraine, Russia also wants to sow internal discord in the United States. We see this both in this disaster and in the Maui fires in 2023.

KELLY: Yeah.

HUO: Russian state media amplified American - often conservative - voices criticizing the government's disaster response. This didn't get much traction, though.

KELLY: And this specific false claim - has it gotten much traction - traveled very far?

HUO: So it's gotten a million views on X with help from one pro-Russian influencer and then an American influencer."

### Evidence from `web_search`
Tasnim News Agency published an article on January 12, 2025, discussing Russia's comments on the California wildfires, including comments from Maria Zakharova (<image:4830>) and the spread of wildfires in Los Angeles County (<image:4831>). The Dispatch published an article on January 15, 2025, stating that Vladimir Saldo offered sanctuary to California fire victims (<image:4838>).

NPR published an article on January 16, 2025, discussing how pro-Kremlin social media accounts spread a false narrative about the Los Angeles wildfires (<image:4849>, <image:4853>).

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Russia commented on the California wildfires in January 2025. Maria Zakharova made comments, and Vladimir Saldo offered sanctuary to fire victims. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Russia offered assistance for the wildfires. The NPR article mentions that pro-Kremlin social media accounts spread a false narrative about the wildfires.

Therefore, the claim is not directly supported by the evidence. The evidence suggests that Russia was involved in the discussion and offered sanctuary, but not assistance.

To verify the claim, information about any specific offers of assistance from Russia is missing.

Jan. "It's just so typical of what we see from Russia, \[to\] take advantage of an ongoing crisis for their own ends," said Darren Linvill, a communications professor and co-director of Clemson University's Media Forensics Hub.

The story that initially circulated was debunked by professional fact checkers from [Greece](https://www.factchecker.gr/2025/01/12/russian-propaganda-8-mansions-of-high-ranking-ukrainian-military-officials-did-not-burn-down-in-los-angeles/)
 and the [United States](https://www.snopes.com/news/2025/01/13/wildfires-ukraine-mansions/)
. The influencers have said they did not know the company paying them was linked to Russia.

Other Russian Telegram channels are also spreading false or unverified narratives about the southern California fires and the government’s response, as well as amplifying critiques from Americans including the president-elect’s son, Donald Trump, Jr., Andy Carvin of the Atlantic Council’s DFRLab told NPR in an email. Pro-Kremlin social media accounts have spread baseless claims that Ukrainian military officials owned mansions that were destroyed in the fires that swept the Los Angeles region.

Pro-Kremlin social media accounts and outlets have been spreading a [baseless narrative](https://www.snopes.com/news/2025/01/13/wildfires-ukraine-mansions/)
 that mansions belonging to Ukrainian military officers burned down [in the Los Angeles wildfires](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/15/nx-s1-5260939/fires-los-angeles-palisades-eaton-wildfires-winds)
. Researchers who study Russian influence operations say it is part of the Kremlin’s larger campaign to discredit the Ukrainian government and [undermine U.S. support for Ukraine](https://www.npr.org/2024/06/06/g-s1-2965/russia-propaganda-deepfakes-sham-websites-social-media-ukraine)
.

“It is the latest in a long string of assertions by Russian officials, media, and the pro-Kremlin online ecosystem that Ukrainian officials are corrupt and use foreign aid money to enrich themselves.” Léa Ronzaud, a senior investigator at research firm Graphika, told NPR in an email.

“It’s just so typical of what we see from Russia, \[to\] take advantage of an ongoing crisis for their own ends,” said Darren Linvill, a communications professor and co-director of Clemson University’s Media Forensics Hub.

The Ukrainian general story first emerged on a pro-Russian Telegram channel four days after the fires started in Los Angeles. Within hours, it was amplified by several other sources, including another Telegram channel which labeled it as satire, an X account, and a website that resembles a [pro-Russian network](https://www.sgdsn.gouv.fr/files/files/20240212_NP_SGDSN_VIGINUM_PORTAL-KOMBAT-NETWORK_ENG_VF.pdf)
 that French authorities previously identified. Some of the posts amplifying the baseless claim falsely credited it to United24 Media, a website affiliated with the Ukrainian government.

The Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council’s Center for Countering Disinformation issued a [statement](https://x.com/CforCD/status/1878381491056501245)
 describing the claim as “Russian propaganda.” It said it had verified with United24 Media that it did not create or share the story.

NPR has not obtained evidence that any Ukrainian generals owned homes in Los Angeles that were destroyed by the fires. The Ukrainian government denied to NPR that any general’s homes were affected by the fire.

The next day, an influencer using the handle @OlgaBazova, who has previously echoed narratives pushed by known Russian influence networks, [shared the story](https://archive.ph/wZHZb)
 in English with its 700,000 followers on X. The account’s bio describes itself as “specializing in humoristic geopolitical analytics, exposing hypocrisy and satire.”

Later in the evening, Robert “Buzz” Patterson, an American conservative influencer with 400,000 followers on X, [repeated the claim](https://archive.ph/2BL9c)
, seemingly without irony, in a post that has been viewed over a million times, according to X’s data.

THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR:

[Become a Sponsor](https://www.opb.org/sponsorship/)

When contacted by NPR on X about the post, @OlgaBazova responded with a link to a Russian-language article that cited the original Telegram claim about the mansions.

Patterson did not respond to messages from NPR asking why he had posted the claim.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Russia commented on the California wildfires in January 2025. Maria Zakharova made comments, and Vladimir Saldo offered sanctuary to fire victims. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Russia offered assistance for the wildfires. The NPR article mentions that pro-Kremlin social media accounts spread a false narrative about the wildfires.

Therefore, the claim is not directly supported by the evidence. The evidence suggests that Russia was involved in the discussion and offered sanctuary, but not assistance.

To verify the claim, information about any specific offers of assistance from Russia is missing.

Russia exploits wildfires in Los Angeles to push anti-US, anti-Ukraine propaganda

Russia exploits wildfires in Los Angeles to push anti-US, anti-Ukraine propaganda

#### Maria Zakharova

Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman

U.S. uses forced labor by involving inmates in fighting Los Angeles fires, while sanctioning China for using forced labor in Xinjiang.

[Source: RIA Novosti, January 12, 2025](https://ria.ru/20250112/zaharova-1993301092.html "Source: RIA Novosti, January 12, 2025")

False

Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova accused the United States of “obscurantist hypocrisy” for allowing inmates to fight Los Angeles wildfires. has been condemning for years.

"Hundreds of prisoners have been recruited to fight wildfires in southern California … In recent years, U.S. officials have repeatedly criticized China for using forced labor, especially in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region … \[W\]ill Congress impose sanctions on the California government, private companies, and ordinary Americans for using prison labor to fight fires."

The claim is false.

[In California, inmates voluntarily join firefighting crews](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/10/nx-s1-5254122/inmate-firefighters-california-wildfires)
 if they meet the program’s qualifications, which consider physical fitness and behavioral records. government is impoverishing its own citizens.

Speaking at a January 14 press conference on the results of Russian diplomacy in 2024, Lavrov said, that Americans “burned almost all of California,” and the damage is estimated $250 billion, which is “comparable” to what the U.S. pledged to [Ukraine](https://www.state.gov/bureau-of-political-military-affairs/releases/2025/01/u-s-security-cooperation-with-ukraine)
 about $66.2 billion in [security assistance](https://media.defense.gov/2025/Jan/09/2003626079/-1/-1/1/KEY-ACHIEVEMENTS-AND-FACTS-US-SECURITY-ASSISTANCE-TO-UKRAINE.PDF)
 between 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea, and February 2022 when Moscow launched a war, and about $66.5 billion since.

Lavrov’s claim that by aiding Ukraine the U.S. society, in part due to the [Russian propaganda influence](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/07/nx-s1-5101895/doj-says-russia-paid-right-wing-influencers-to-spread-russian-propaganda)
.

Experts, however, argue that opposite to draining American economy, the large portion of the Ukraine aid is being reinvested domestically, [boosting defense manufacturing industry and sustaining jobs](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/blog-post/us-aid-ukraine-helps-american-economy-and-boosts-us-jobs)
.

Russian propaganda exploited the Ukrainian angle in the Los Angeles fires trying to spread false accusations against Ukraine’s military command of misappropriating the Western aid.

Russia’s newly emerged group of social media influencers nicknamed “milbloggers” as most members are either Russian combatants or pro-war reporters from the battle lines in Ukraine, played key role in creating and spreading such false claims.

Russian Telegram channel Voennyj obozrevatel' (Military Observer) alleged on January 11, that eight mansions worth a total of $90 million owned by high-ranking Ukrainian military officials, were destroyed in the Los Angeles wildfires.

“According to Ukrainian sources, 8 mansions owned by high-ranking Ukrainian military personnel were burned during large-scale wildfires in Los Angeles. The total value of these properties amounts to $90 million and was allegedly purchased with funds provided by the West as part of economic aid to Kyiv after the war began.”

Russian state-controlled news sites and media outlets, including Gazeta.ru, Lenta.ru, EADaily, News.ru, Komsomolskaya Pravda, Tsargrad, and Rossiyskaya Gazeta used the post in their news coverage.

[Multiple fact-checking outlets](https://www.factchecker.gr/2025/01/12/russian-propaganda-8-mansions-of-high-ranking-ukrainian-military-officials-did-not-burn-down-in-los-angeles/)
 and even some Russian news media debunked the post as lacking merit and unsubstantiated.

Yet the claim about the luxury villas of Ukrainian generals allegedly burning down in Los Angeles spread on X the following days, receiving millions of views and thousands of reposts.

In another disinformation plot, on January 13-14, Russian state-owned news sites sought to undermine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's decision to send Ukrainian firefighters to Los Angeles to help put out the wildfires.

State-owned RIA Novosti, RT, and others used an X post by “Ukrainian journalist” Diana Panchenko, who wrote responding to Zeleskyy’s announcement: "I am glad that hundreds of men will have the opportunity to leave Ukraine these days."

Russian news outlets generalized the post, speculating it signaled that Ukrainian journalists oppose Ukraine's fight for independence and the Ukrainian men are desperate to leave the country.

In fact, Reporters Without Borders exposed [Diana Panchenko as Russian propagandist](https://rsf.org/en/diana-panchenko-ukrainian-propagandist-working-kremlin)
 working for the Kremlin. <image:2557>

The NPR article mentions that pro-Kremlin social media accounts spread a false narrative about the wildfires.

Therefore, the claim is not directly supported by the evidence. The evidence suggests that Russia was involved in the discussion and offered sanctuary, but not assistance.

To verify the claim, information about any specific offers of assistance from Russia is missing.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The German Marshall Fund published an article on January 15, 2025, discussing how Russian state-affiliated accounts leveraged the California wildfires to sow division and undermine trust in relief efforts, and reduce public support for Ukraine (<image:1>). NPR and OPB published articles on January 16, 2025, discussing how Russia used the California wildfires to advance anti-Ukraine propaganda, with pro-Kremlin social media accounts spreading false narratives. The OPB article mentions that the story was debunked by fact-checkers.

## Elaboration
The new evidence reinforces the previous findings. It highlights that Russia leveraged the California wildfires to sow division and spread anti-Ukraine propaganda. However, the evidence still does not mention any offers of assistance from Russia.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified. The evidence focuses on Russia's use of the wildfires for propaganda purposes, not on providing aid.

From [Source](https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-exploits-wildfires-in-los-angeles-to-push-anti-u-s-anti-ukraine-propaganda/7938909.html): 
Content: The Voice of America published an article on January 16, 2025, discussing how Russia exploited the California wildfires to push anti-US and anti-Ukraine propaganda. The article mentions Maria Zakharova's comments and a claim by Lavrov. The article also discusses how Russian state-controlled news sites spread disinformation about the wildfires. <image:2557>


## Elaboration
The evidence consistently shows that Russia commented on the California wildfires and used them to spread propaganda. However, none of the provided sources mention Russia offering assistance for the wildfires.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that Russia commented on the California wildfires in January 2025 and used them to spread propaganda. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that Russia offered assistance for the wildfires.

The claim is not supported by the evidence, as the search results focus on Russia's commentary and propaganda efforts related to the wildfires, not on any offers of assistance. `false`


## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The fact-check reveals that while Russia commented on the California wildfires in January 2025 and used them for propaganda, there is no evidence from sources like Tasnim News Agency, The Dispatch, NPR, and Voice of America to support the claim that Russia offered assistance for the wildfires.

Experts told _Newsweek_ that, even if an American PMC were operational in Kursk, it would not equate to Ukraine's raid being conducted under the direction or patronage of the Biden administration, as alleged by the Foreign Ministry.

Helene Olsen, a lecturer in defense studies at King's College London and an expert in the usa of mercenaries and other forms of private contractors in conflict, told _Newsweek_ that it is in the nature of PMCs to "go where the money is."

"While American PMCs traditionally have worked closely with the US Gov and many American PMCs have interests that align with the US Gov, PMCs, irrespective of origin, are ultimately businesses," Olsen said, adding that Russia "would benefit from making up these allegations considering the stigma connected with the private military industry."

According to a release on its website, the ministry expressed its "strong protest" to Holmes "in connection with provocative actions of American reporters who illegally infiltrated Kursk Oblast for propagandist reporting of crimes of Kyiv's regime."

The ministry also claimed to have seen evidence "of the participation of an American \[private military company\] on the side of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the invasion of the territory of the Russian Federation."

According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, however, the involvement of an American PMC in these operations ran "counter to the Biden administration's assertions that it was allegedly not involved in the attack by Ukrainian neo-Nazis on Russia" and that this proved "the United States, as a direct participant in the conflict, is involved in Vladimir Zelensky's malicious plans."

The ministry went on to say that an investigation would be launched into the "American citizens involved in these crimes." It added that those who cross over into Russian territory "automatically become a legitimate military target for the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation."

Eugenio Cusumano, associate professor of political science at the University of Messina, Italy, believes that Russia's allegations of American PMC presence in Kursk is "rather unlikely."

"Russia has repeatedly stated [NATO](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/nato)

*   Russian Foreign Ministry summons US Charge d'affaires in Moscow Stephanie Holmes to convey strong protest against 'provocative actions of American reporters' and 'participation of the American PMCs'   

**MOSCOW** 

Russia protested on Tuesday that US private military companies (PMCs) are fighting alongside Ukraine in the Kursk region, while reporters from several major American media outlets illegally entered Russian territory to cover the incursion. 

The Russian Foreign Ministry claimed in a statement that soldiers from US private military companies are fighting alongside Ukrainian troops in the Kursk region, and journalists illegally entered Russian territory to cover the incursion.

US Charge d'affaires Stephanie Holmes was summoned to the Foreign Ministry in Moscow to convey strong protest against the "provocative actions of American reporters" and "participation of the American PMCs on the side of Ukraine's armed forces during their invasion" of Russia, it said.

"Such actions are contradicting statements by Joe Biden administration about non-involvement in Ukraine's neo-Nazi attack against Russia, proving with all clarity US involvement as a direct participant of the conflict in (Ukraine's President Volodymyr) Zelenskyy's malicious intentions," the ministry stressed.

The ministry warned that Russian law enforcement will investigate US citizens’ actions and take necessary measures to bring them to justice.

"All foreign 'specialists' and mercenaries illegally crossing the border of our country automatically become a legitimate military target for the armed forces of the Russian Federation," it said.

Kyiv's incursion into the Kursk region began on the night of August 5-6, when Ukrainian forces entered near Sudzha. **Please contact us for subscription options.**](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/p/subscription/1001)

Расплата за Иловайск: оккупанты понесли огромные потери при бегстве из Балаклеи, видео

При [бегстве из Балаклеи](https://apostrophe.ua/news/society/2022-09-08/v-balaklee-i-okrestnyih-selah-podnyali-ukrainskie-flagi-foto-i-video/278860)
 в Харьковской области российские оккупанты потеряли очень много живой силы и техники.

Подробности феерического отступления россиян появляются в сети.

Украинский журналист Денис Казанский [опубликовал](https://t.me/kazansky2017/3989)
 красноречивое фото, на котором два бойца ВСУ "селфятся" на фоне лежащего на земле "орка".

"_Теперь уже можно! Балаклея - это Украина!_", - подписан кадр.

![](https://static.apostrophe.ua/uploads/image/d65ce3221fb2320e1df433cbd2684f2e.jpg)

Кроме того, в Балаклее у оккупантов очень большие потери. Россияне драпали так быстро, что [бросали](https://t.me/kazansky2017/3991?single)
 тела погибших сослуживцев.

**Осторожно, жесткие кадры! 18+**

Разгром российской армии в Балаклее стал расплатой за Иловайск в 2014 году, [отмечает](https://t.me/kazansky2017/3994)
 журналист, добавляя, что на дорогах в округе повсюду разбитая и брошенная техника оккупантов.

Еще один украинский журналист Анатолий Цаплиенко [сообщает](https://t.me/Tsaplienko/15021)
, что россияне пробовали убежать, но на дороге их встретила засада украинских бойцов. Чем все закончилось, можно посмотреть на видео.

Напомним, Президент Украины [Владимир Зеленский официально подтвердил освобождение города Балаклеи в Харьковской области от российских оккупантов](https://apostrophe.ua/news/society/2022-09-08/teper-ofitsialno-zelenskiy-podtverdil-osvobojdenie-balaklei-ot-okkupantov/278876)
.

  

##### Президент Зеленский предположил, что война может завершиться в 2026 году. Верите ли вы в это?

Да, это возможно

Нет, сомневаюсь

Трудно сказать

!Оккупанты понесли огромные потери при паническом бегстве из Балаклеи <image:2752>

Многие российские военные попали в засаду.

При бегстве из Балаклеи в Харьковской области российские оккупанты потеряли очень много живой силы и техники.

Подробности феерического отступления россиян появляются в сети, сообщает [«Апостроф»](https://apostrophe.ua/news/society/2022-09-08/rasplata-za-ilovaysk-okkupantyi-ponesli-ogromnyie-poteri-pri-begstve-iz-balaklei-video/278880/)
.

Украинский журналист **Денис Казанский** опубликовал красноречивое фото, на котором два бойца ВСУ «селфятся» на фоне лежащего на земле оккупанта.

«Теперь уже можно! Балаклея - это Украина!», - подписан кадр.

! <image:2753>

Кроме того, в Балаклее у оккупантов очень большие потери. Россияне убегали так быстро, что бросали тела погибших сослуживцев.

Разгром российской армии в Балаклее стал расплатой за Иловайск в 2014 году, отмечает журналист, добавляя, что на дорогах в округе повсюду разбитая и брошенная техника оккупантов.

Еще один украинский журналист **Анатолий Цаплиенко** сообщает, что россияне пробовали убежать, но на дороге их встретила засада украинских бойцов. Чем все закончилось, можно посмотреть на видео.

Российские войска отступают. Как развивается украинское контрнаступление и чем успехи ВСУ последних недель грозят России — мнение экспертов и российских военных

Украина [объявила](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1018539645523163)
 о контрнаступлении на юге страны в Херсонской области 29 августа, а 6 сентября начала наступательную операцию на востоке — в Харьковской области. За это время украинская армия освободила десятки населенных пунктов и продвинулась вглубь российских оборонительных позиций. Поступают сообщения о том, что российские войска отступают из стратегически важных городов — Балаклеи, Купянска, Изюма, Волчанска и Лимана. Военные эксперты называют события последних двух недель невообразимым [успехом](https://republic.ru/posts/105163)

### **Российские войска не могут держать оборону и бегут**

«8 лет говорили что и когда будут делать: один треп, обо всем со всех щелей. Никакой тактики, никакого профессионализма, никакого ума. Когда на это \[контрнаступление ВСУ\] смотрим мы \[военные\], мы понимаем, что изначально все было сделано неправильно. Но забили на это хуй, начали двигаться дальше криво, коряво. А с другой \[украинской\] стороны, люди просто взяли, увидели это, соорганизовались, все сделали. ‎

Поэтому в плане войны все выглядит очень логично: мы начали как долбоебы, не смогли ничего удержать, всё разъебали, один сплошной пиздеж вокруг, командования ноль, обеспечения ноль, руководства ноль. И вот изначально было понятно, что будет заканчиваться тем, что нас просто разнесут», — комментирует «‎Важным историям»‎ ситуацию на фронте бывший российский военнослужащий, который участвовал в войне в Украине. «Вспоминаю, как долго \[ВС РФ\] ковыряли Мариуполь и Северодонецк, а тут два дня \[понадобилось ВСУ\]. \[При том, что\] Изюм чуть ли не с первых дней войны был под контролем \[российских войск\], то есть они даже не планировали и не думали, что его, возможно, придется оборонять», — недоумевает другой бывший российский военный.

При этом, в [брифинге](https://t.me/mod_russia/19716)
 российского Минобороны от 10 сентября не было сказано ни слова об оставленных российскими войсками городах. Позже Минобороны [объяснило](https://t.me/mod_russia/19719)
 отступление российских войск «операцией по свертыванию и переброске Изюмско-Балаклейской группировки» для наращивания усилий по «освобождению Донбасса».

«Сейчас мы видим, как российские войска бегут, потому что не могут держать оборону», — описывает происходящее украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. Этому предшествовал первый крупный успех ВСУ в Харьковской области — освобождение 8 сентября города Балаклея, который был оккупирован с марта. «Это место, где сосредоточены склады с боеприпасами для артиллерии, поэтому \[ее освобождение\] достаточно серьезно усилит огневые возможности ВСУ», — говорит военный эксперт.

Именно освобождение Балаклеи позволило ВСУ лишить российскую группировку, которая там сконцентрирована, возможности держать оборону, поскольку отрезало их от «логистической артерии» Волчанск-Большой Бурлук-Купянск-Изюм, по которой происходило снабжение армии, объясняет эксперт. «Без снабжения вся эта масса личного состава и техники, сконцентрированная на Изюмском направлении, оказалась бы не боеспособной», — говорит Коваленко.

По словам российского военного эксперта Юрия Федорова, у российских войск на этом направлении «очень крупные потери»: не только убитыми, но и пленными: «как минимум сотни пленных, если не пара тысяч».

Вероятное большое количество пленных подтверждают и двое бывших военнослужащих российской армии. «При спонтанном отступлении особенно много пленных. Связи внутри подразделений нет. Кто где находится, командиры не всегда знают. Соответственно, об отступлении не все могут знать», — говорят они. Бывший военнослужащий одного из элитных подразделений в разговоре с «Важными историями» отметил, что на Харьковском направлении обе стороны несут ощутимые потери. «Когда мои говорят: „Бля, там пиздец“, значит, что всё плохо», — добавил собеседник «Важных историй».

### **Почему провалилась российская оборона**

Несмотря на то, что в Харьковской области было сконцентрировано больше российских войск, чем задействовано сил ВСУ в контрнаступлении на этом участке, операция была направлена на особо уязвимые места, где возможности российских подразделений по обороне были истощены, говорит украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. «Российское командование знало, что у них есть уязвимые места в Харьковской области, они даже пытались их в значительной степени усилить. Знали, но предотвратить \[исход событий\] не могли: нехватка ресурсов уже начала сказываться на их возможностях по ведению обороны. И сейчас мы наблюдаем каскадный обвал обороны», — объясняет Александр Коваленко.

*   [ЗСУ вже на околицях окупованого Куп’янська](https://cripo.com.ua/news/war/zsu-vzhe-na-okolytsyah-okupovanogo-kup-yanska/ "Permalink to ЗСУ вже на околицях окупованого Куп’янська")
    

Российский военный эксперт Юрий Федоров говорит, что в Харьковской области украинская армия использовала новую тактику, которая и обеспечила успех на этом направлении. «ВСУ действуют очень динамично и фактически не задерживаются на то, чтобы штурмовать те или иные города. Они просто их обходят, берут в кольцо, и тогда гарнизоны этих городков и небольших сел просто вынуждены капитулировать, — рассказывает российский военный эксперт Юрий Федоров.

— Сейчас уже практически взят Купянск, по крайней мере, та часть, которая находится на правом берегу. Сдан Изюм или находится в процессе. Российские войска уходят оттуда, чтобы не попасть в окружение. Это, в общем, разумное решение, потому что коммуникации перерезаны. Сам по себе Изюм находится на стыке двух рек: Оскол и Северский Донец. Если его окружить, скажем, с северо-востока или с севера, то он просто будет отрезан от подвоза боеприпасов и всего прочего, и \[российская армия\] вынуждена будет капитулировать. Чтобы этого не случилось, они просто выводят войска, пока есть возможность».

Юрий Федоров считает, что ВСУ тактически и оперативно переиграли российские войска, которым не хватило ресурсов для сдерживания этого наступления. «\[Сначала\] была прорвана оборона в районе Балаклеи. А затем российские войска были разбросаны гарнизонами по различным городкам, селам. Эти гарнизоны часто состояли из Росгвардии, а также мобилизованных из так называемых народных республик.

Росгвардия в принципе воевать не умеет, она не для этого предназначена. Задача этих гарнизонов и гвардейских полков заключалась в том, чтобы держать в подчинении местное население. А среди мобилизованных многие в первый раз взяли в руки автомат, надели каску, мотивации \[у них нет\] никакой. Российские регулярные части были отведены частично на правобережье в Херсонскую область, частично на Донецкое направление, где они пытались штурмовать пригород Донецка, занятый ВСУ. Поэтому вот такой разгром», — объясняет военный эксперт.

Это же подтверждает в разговоре с «Важными историями» и российский военнослужащий, который был на этом направлении. «\[Подведомственные\] Минобороны \[войска\], группировка Восток, вышли с этого направления еще в июле в Белгородскую область. На тот момент в Изюме я встречал БАРСов (_боевой армейский резерв страны_ — **Прим. ред.**), ополченцев и войска ПВО Западного округа. После \[их\] выхода в Изюм зашёл СОБР и ОМОН. Соответственно, там действительно остались только „БАРСики“, ополченцы и Росгвардия», — говорит он.

По словам эксперта Федорова, российское командование просчиталось в оценке ситуации, когда перебросило боевые части с юга Харьковской области на другие направления до начала контрнаступления. «Считалось, что в районе расположения изюмской группировки ничего страшного случиться не может. Просчет заключался в том, что не была оценена вероятность того, что украинские войска начнут там наступление», — говорит Федоров.

«Российское командование с профессиональной точки зрения оценивают как очень слабое. Это люди, которые умеют бросать в бой значительное количество живой силы, но отсутствует инициатива в исполнении приказа. Написано „занять такой-то перекресток“, а может быть, лучше занять другой перекресток рядышком, но это недопустимая вещь, \[только\] тупое упорное выполнение приказа», — добавляет он.

«Нельзя, чтобы армия, которая строилась двадцать лет, сегодня такая: все, мы будем работать по-другому. Нас заставляли быть тупыми и не принимать никаких решений, — подтверждает бывший военнослужащий российской армии. — Попробуй сержанту скажи, что ты считаешь, что лучше вот так вот. Тебе ебало просто сломают, если не застрелят сразу. И так на всех уровнях. Верховный главнокомандующий принимает только „‎правильные“‎ решения — а все остальные должны их исполнять. И если что, они будут нести наказание, не потому что сверху долбоебы, а потому что „‎вы плохо \[приказы\] исполняете, вы не исполнительные“»‎, — говорит он.

«Самые успешные операции за всю мою службу были те, о которых знали только мы. Только те люди, которые в ней участвуют. Потому что стоит таким заняться командованию… Поэтому когда мы сами решали, что делать, не ожидая команды сверху или пока качнут связь, чтобы уточнить, связаться, запросить разрешение на выполнение, уточнение и прочую херню, мы всегда все выполняли на 100 %», — отмечает бывший военнослужащий одного из элитных подразделений ВС РФ.

Накануне, 9 сентября, Минобороны [показало](https://t.me/mod_russia/19710)
 кадры переброски военной техники в Харьковскую область, но это подкрепление не помогло отстоять города. «Этих подкреплений крайне недостаточно, — говорит Юрий Федоров. — Даже вертолетами перебрасывали личный состав и легкую технику. Но это все равно, что пытаться из пипетки наполнить стакан, практически бессмысленная задача».

Александр Коваленко объясняет это тем, что переброска поддержки была лишь пропагандистским жестом. «Российской армии срочно понадобилось демонстрировать некую активность, что „помощь близка“, „мы своих не бросаем“, якобы они готовы оказывать поддержку тем подразделениям, которые оказались в сложной ситуации. Но эта переброска имела неорганизованный, хаотический характер, она не могла обеспечить никакой поддержки», — говорит эксперт.

По его словам, те подразделения, которые зашли в зону боевых действий для поддержки, были обречены. Многие из них давным-давно требовали ротации или вывода для восстановления боеспособности из-за понесенных до этого серьезных потерь. «В ближайшее время мы будем узнавать о большом количестве подразделений российской армии, которые попросту перестали существовать, поскольку вместо вывода на восстановление боеспособности их кинули в самую мясорубку, самое жерло боевых столкновений», — говорит он.

### **Чем российской армии грозит прорыв ВСУ**

Освобождение Купянска и Изюма важно в стратегическом смысле тем, что оно отрезает российские группировки от путей снабжения и открывает ВСУ путь на Луганское и Донецкое направление, говорит украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. «Эти города важны тем, что они являются неотъемлемой частью логистических артерий поставок техники, материально-технического обеспечения, боеприпасов, личного состава как в Харьковскую область, так и в целом на донбасский плацдарм. Купянск является очень важным логистическим узлом, сердцем этой артерии.

Через него шло обеспечение города Изюм, который стал центром сосредоточения самой большой бронетанковой группы российских оккупантов за все время полномасштабного вторжения в Украину, — говорит эксперт. — И вся эта масса должна была идти в сторону Славянска и Краматорска. Сейчас планы по захвату Славянска и Краматорска можно считать аннулированными. Потеря \[российской армией\] таких населенных пунктов как Купянск и Изюм полностью рушит систему обеспечения донбасского плацдарма и позволяет ВСУ в дальнейшем развивать контрнаступательные действия уже не только в Харьковской области, но и в Луганском и Донецком направлениях».

В ближайшие дни можно ожидать, что Харьковская область будет освобождена, уверен российский военный эксперт Юрий Федоров. «Это не решающее сражение, но очень крупный успех ВСУ», — говорит он. По его словам, тогда вооруженные силы Украины смогут перебросить значительное количество личного состава и на другие направления.

Херсонская область
------------------

### **Российской армии не хватает сил для обороны**

Еще одно не менее важное направление, на котором продолжают наступать силы ВСУ, — контролируемый российскими войсками плацдарм на правом берегу Днепра в Херсонской области. Украинское контрнаступление началось там 29 августа. В тот день, по [данным](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1018539645523163)
 оперативной группировки ВСУ «Каховка», ей удалось «прорвать первую линию обороны» в Херсонской области. «109 полк „ДНР“ отошел со своих позиций, российские десантники, которые были их поддержкой, сбежали с поля боя», — [говорилось](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1018539645523163)
 в сообщении. 4 сентября ВСУ [установили](https://www.facebook.com/kirill.timoshenko/posts/5588117717898633)
 украинский флаг в крупном населенном пункте Высокополье.

Точная численность российской группировки, которая находится на правом берегу Днепра, где Украина ведет контрнаступление, неизвестна. По разным оценкам, на начало контрнаступления там находилось от [20](https://www.currenttime.tv/a/ukraine-russia-war-kherson/31989285.html)
 до [25 тысяч](https://www.currenttime.tv/a/32011307.html)
 российских военных. Нет точных данных и о численности украинской группировки. Источник «Важных историй» из числа бывших сотрудников российской спецслужбы, пожелавший остаться анонимным, говорит, что для контрнаступления в Херсонской области Украина сформировала «довольно скромные резервы»: их численность — 10–12 тысяч человек.

Однако, по его словам, у Украины есть еще резервы, не брошенные в контрнаступление, которые не должны позволить российской стороне замкнуть окружение вокруг прорвавшихся вперед войск. Максимальную оценку украинских сил на этом фронте [приводит](https://www.currenttime.tv/a/rf-boitsya-poteryat-litso-i-poetomu-otdaet-svoih-soldat-na-myaso-na-pravom-beregu-dnepra-eksperty-o-rasklade-sil-na-yuge-ukrainy-/32011763.html)
 украинский военный эксперт Роман Свитан: по его данным, там находится 30 тысяч бойцов ВСУ.

«Теми силами, которые присутствуют сейчас на правом берегу Днепра, российская армия в среднесрочной перспективе не сможет удерживать контрнаступление ВСУ», — уверен украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. По словам аналитика Conflict Intelligence Team (CIT) Кирилла Михайлова, ВСУ удалось создать определенное превосходство в численности личного состава на основных направлениях наступления в Херсонской области. «К этому добавляется эффективная работа артиллерии и локальное превосходство Украины в воздухе, которое позволяет использовать как фронтовую авиацию, так и ударные беспилотники», — комментирует он расстановку сил.

По его словам, сейчас украинцы наступают в Херсонской области как минимум на трех направлениях: с запада; северо-запада, где они расширяют плацдарм на оккупированном \[Россией\] берегу реки Ингулец; и с севера, где им удалось взять крупный населенный пункт Высокополье и «затрофеить» большое количество военной техники российского десанта. На сегодня украинской армии удалось продвинуться на территорию более десяти населенных пунктов в Херсонской области, говорит Михайлов. «Хоть эти населенные пункты и небольшие, они являются оборонительными узлами. Пока мы видим преимущество на украинской стороне», — говорит он.

Нехватку ресурсов у российской группировки на этом направлении подтверждает и бывший сотрудник российской спецслужбы. «Из-за нехватки солдат и офицеров российские войска на фронте сосредоточены в недостаточном количестве. Людей примерно в три раза меньше, чем нужно для выполнения поставленных задач: требуется минимум одна батальонно-тактическая группа на 3 километра, а у России — одна на 5 километров. Такой численностью не наступают, это похоже на авантюру, — говорит он. — Прорвав первую линию \[обороны\] российских войск, украинское наступление должно было упереться во вторую линию, но проблема в том, что у российской военной группировки ее нет: из-за нехватки людей такие прорывы затыкают лишь мобильными резервами. И это может сделать ситуацию непредсказуемой».

Достоверных данных о потерях обеих сторон в этой схватке сейчас нет, говорит аналитик CIT Кирилл Михайлов, но судя по [публикации](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/09/04/ukraine-is-losing-fewer-soldiers-in-its-counter-offensive-than-russia-claims)
 The Economist (журналисты побывали в прифронтовом городе Николаеве, поговорили с местными врачами и не увидели там «переполненных моргов» с погибшими украинскими военными, о чем утверждает российская сторона), хоть потери украинской армии выросли с началом наступления, они не катастрофические, как это заявляет российское Минобороны. По словам бывшего сотрудника российской спецслужбы, с которым поговорили «Важные истории», потери украинской стороны высоки, потому что наступающая сторона всегда теряет больше обороняющейся.

На третий день контрнаступления в Херсонской области The Wall Street Journal [поговорила](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ukrainian-soldiers-say-they-are-advancing-in-the-south-but-at-a-cost-11661983338)
 в госпитале с ранеными украинскими солдатами, которые участвовали в операции. По их словам, бои на пути к Херсону идут крайне ожесточенные, но украинские войска продвигаются вперед. «У них много техники, но мало людей», — сказал один из украинских военных. Кроме этого, они утверждают, что некоторые российские солдаты бегут со своих позиций, бросая технику и устанавливая мины на телах погибших товарищей.

По словам одного из российских военнослужащих, который сейчас находится в Херсонской области, российская армия там находится в тяжелом положении, солдаты массово пытаются уволиться. «Две недели назад командиры нам сказали, что на нас наступление идет. А нам даже боеприпасы никак не привезти, потому что дамба разбита (_вероятно, речь идет о дамбе в Новой Каховке_ — **Прим. ред.**). Люди каждый день ходят с рапортами \[на увольнение\], но почти всем их разрывают», — написал он. Спустя две недели военный передал «Важным историям», что при обстреле чудом выжил, и «там все жестко».

Другой источник, близкий к российским военнослужащим, которые находятся на Херсонском направлении, передал, что солдаты в полном шоке, «никто ничего не понимает, гибнут пачками, потери ужасные. Некоторые вообще звонят, прощаются, мы, говорят, смертники ебучие».

### **У российской армии проблемы со снабжением**

Еще одна проблема российской группировки, которая должна сдерживать прорыв украинской армии в Херсонской области, заключается в том, что она оказалась отрезанной от всех основных путей снабжения. Ранее снабжение российской группировки на правом берегу Днепра происходило через мосты, по которым везли боеприпасы, технику, топливо и продовольствие с левого берега реки. Однако в результате ударов ВСУ все стационарные мосты через Днепр были выведены из строя, понтонные и паромные переправы постоянно подвергаются обстрелам.

«\[Исход этого противостояния на правом берегу Днепра\] зависит от того, удастся ли россиянам организовать поставки \[снабжения\] паромами, поскольку все постоянные мосты перестали функционировать. Наладить понтонные переправы через Днепр \[российской армии\] не удалось. Сейчас функционирует несколько паромных переправ — их украинцам тяжелее поражать, чем мосты, потому что паромы мобильны, сложно предугадать, где они находятся.

Однако периодически украинцы пытаются поражать скопление российской техники в местах ожидания паромов. Это должно вызывать значительные проблемы со снабжением. Насколько россиянам хватит ресурсов для противостояния, зависит от того, смогут ли они эффективно перебрасывать подкрепление, а также от того, сколько продержатся силы ВДВ, пока у них не закончится техника, которая не отличается бронированностью», — говорит аналитик CIT Кирилл Михайлов.

### **Чем России грозит продвижение ВСУ** 

Освобождение украинскими войсками населенного пункта Высокополье в Херсонской области 4 сентября сделало невозможным для российской армии ведение наступательных действий в направлении Кривого Рога в Днепропетровской области, говорит украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. «Это была крайняя северная точка, откуда россияне могли развернуть наступательную операцию в Криворожском направлении. В настоящее время эти возможности у них отсутствуют, — объясняет он.

— Кроме того, благодаря Высокополью ВСУ получили возможность расширить плацдарм в правобережной части Херсонской области и сформировать условия для контрнаступления на достаточно угрожающем участке для многих подразделений ВС РФ. Если ВСУ будут достаточно успешно развивать наступательные действия, то мы сможем говорить о том, что огромное количество российских подразделений может оказаться фактически в окружении».

Стратегический и политический смысл операции на Херсонском направлении для Украины в том, чтобы разгромить российскую группировку на правом берегу Днепра и освободить Херсон, считает аналитик CIT Кирилл Михайлов. «Это позволит задействовать экономические ресурсы области, а также продемонстрировать западным партнерам Украины \[поставщикам оружия\], что страна в состоянии наступать и выигрывать — нужно только больше \[поставок\] оружия.

Кроме этого, в долгосрочной перспективе ликвидация правобережного плацдарма устраняет перспективу наступления \[российской армии\] на Николаев, Кривой Рог и Одессу, потому что именно захват мостов и выход на правый берег Днепра был самым значительным успехом россиян на первом этапе операции. Ликвидация этого плацдарма сильно снижает угрозу всей правобережной Украине, в том числе западному Черноморью, которое критически важно для Украины с точки зрения, например, экспорта сельхозпродукции», — объясняет эксперт значимость операции на этом направлении.

Где еще наступают ВСУ и какая битва будет решающей
--------------------------------------------------

Кроме Херсонской и Харьковской областей, ВСУ осуществляют наступательные действия в Донецкой области, говорит украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. В частности освобожден населенный пункт Озерное в Донецкой области. «Аналогичные новости будут поступать и из Луганской области, где значительно активизировались ВСУ, воспользовавшись ослаблением российских подразделений после достаточно продолжительного воздействия на них огневым потенциалом», — уверен эксперт.

По мнению Коваленко, решающей для этой войны битвой станет контрнаступление украинской армии в Запорожской области. «Битва за правобережную Херсонщину — это очень важный промежуточный этап. После ее завершения и освобождения Херсона будет освобождена и значительная часть ресурсов ВСУ, которые были задействованы для сдерживания российских оккупантов и для ведения этой контрнаступательной операции. И эти ресурсы могут быть использованы на других направлениях: Запорожской, Харьковской, Донецкой и Луганской областях.

Они сыграют решающую роль в значительном ускорении, увеличении активности и интенсивности действий ВСУ. Для командования российских войск очень важно сохранять контроль именно над Запорожской областью. Ее потеря для россиян — это фактически выстрел в висок, поскольку это станет потерей всего юга, а потеря всего юга — это и потеря Крыма. Выйдя в Запорожскую область, ВСУ получат возможность блокировать Крым с материковой части Украины и нанести удары по Керченскому мосту — то есть отрезать его от материковой части России и начать операцию по освобождению Крыма», — говорит он.

«Что война проиграна, можно было легко судить, когда не получилось взять Киев. Плюс сейчас начинается слякоть, холода, потом зима. И такие простые вещи как теплая одежда, нормальная обувь и место для ночлега, будут влиять как на на здоровье, так и на отношение людей на фронте к войне, — говорит бывший российский военный. — Это трагичный конец, которого мы и ожидали. Война работает в обе стороны: за что боролись, на то и напоролись. В наше руководство я не верю, конечно. Как родина нас кидает, мы и так знаем. Уже кинула, начиная с 14-го \[года\] — заканчивая сегодня. Сами это дерьмо устроили, естественно, мы охуеть как насосемся теперь. Проблема в том, что мы изначально на проигравшей и некомпетентной стороне были. Родина сначала кинула мясом, а теперь бросила умирать. И у этого нет ни цели, ни мотива, никакой пользы никому — ни единому человеку».

===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that Russia claimed the presence of American mercenaries in the Kursk region during Ukraine's incursion in August 2024. The U.S. denied these claims. The Anadolu Agency also reported on Russia's protest regarding the participation of US private military companies.

The image shows individuals with American flags on their uniforms. However, the evidence does not confirm the image's authenticity or its connection to the events in the Kursk region.

To verify the claim, additional information is needed to confirm the image's origin, the identity of the individuals, and their involvement in the events in the Kursk region in August 2024.

Content: "<image:9777>

A recent photo confirms that Forward Observation Group, a private military firm under contract with Ukraine, is active in Kursk.

The Russian Foreign Ministry said that the participation of the American PMCs on the side of the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the invasion of the Kursk region proves the involvement of the United States as a [direct party to the conflict](https://eadaily.com/en/news/2024/08/22/mercenaries-from-the-forward-observation-group-pmcs-were-destroyed-in-the-kursk-region-video)
, and mercenaries automatically become a legitimate military target. To avoid a fair fight with an experienced lawyer, most insurance companies settle DBA claims on victim-friendly terms prior to this hearing.

For more information about DBA lost wage replacement, contact [Barnett, Lerner, Karsen, Frankel & Castro, P.A.](https://www.injuredoverseas.com/contact-us/)

  American Private Military Contractors Are in Kursk - Barnett, Lerner, Karsen, Frankel & Castro, P.A. The Foreign Ministry stressed that in relation to the American citizens involved, in accordance with the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, the necessary investigative actions will be carried out to bring them to justice.

The Russian press accused FOG contractors of targeting civilians during the fighting. Then, things changed.

Ukraine’s Kursk offensive is the latest phase in this war and marks the first time fighting has occurred on Russian soil. Prior to the Kursk incursion, Russia was taking roughly 1,000 casualties a day, with corresponding equipment losses. It would likely require several months of recruitment and military production to stop Ukrainian advances and secure Kursk. Alternatively, Russia could continue operations in the Donbas and pay the domestic price of ignoring the Ukrainian incursion and effectively ceding parts of Kursk and Belgorod to Ukraine. But Ukrainian mobile operations in Kursk require much more dynamic air operations, and Ukrainian drones have downed numerous Russian drones. Russia is now forced to fly longer distances in attempts to stop Ukraine in Kursk. Longer flights mean fewer Russian bombs dropped per day. 

#### **What Contractors Do**

That last section touched on the major responsibilities of American private military contractors operating independently of U.S."

### Evidence from `web_search`
Newsweek reports that Russia claimed the presence of American mercenaries in the Kursk region during Ukraine's incursion in August 2024 (<image:3404>, <image:3401>, <image:3403>). The Russian Foreign Ministry protested the alleged involvement of American citizens, which the U.S. denied. The Anadolu Agency also reported on August 20, 2024, that Russia protested the participation of US private military companies fighting alongside Ukraine in the Kursk region (<image:i>).

The Ukrainian Photographers website published news stories on January 23, 2025, and January 21, 2025.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Russia claimed the presence of American mercenaries in the Kursk region during Ukraine's incursion in August 2024. The U.S. denied these claims. The Anadolu Agency also reported on Russia's protest regarding the participation of US private military companies.

The image shows individuals with American flags on their uniforms. However, the evidence does not confirm the image's authenticity or its connection to the events in the Kursk region.

To verify the claim, additional information is needed to confirm the image's origin, the identity of the individuals, and their involvement in the events in the Kursk region in August 2024.
