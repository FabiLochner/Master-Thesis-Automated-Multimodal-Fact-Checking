Trump slams Zelenskyy on Truth Social for saying the end of the Russia war ‘is still very, very far away’
=========================================================================================================

[Politics](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics)
 Mar 3, 2025 1:01 PM EDT

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump slammed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Monday for suggesting that the end of Russia’s war against Ukraine is still likely “very, very far away.”

[**READ MORE:** Fact-checking Trump and Vance’s attacks on Ukrainian President Zelenskyy](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/fact-checking-trump-and-vances-attacks-on-ukrainian-president-zelenskyy)

“This is the worst statement that could have been made by Zelenskyy, and America will not put up with it for much longer!” Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform.

Zelenskyy late Sunday said he believed the war would go on for some time, while trying to offer a positive take about the U.S.-Ukraine relationship in the aftermath of his [contentious White House meeting](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/in-clash-with-zelenskyy-trump-deepens-diplomatic-rift-over-russias-war-in-ukraine)
 with the Republican president and Vice President JD Vance.

“I think our relationship (with the U.S.) will continue, because it’s more than an occasional relationship,” Zelenskyy said, referring to Washington’s support for the past three years of war.

But Trump seemed further irritated by Zelenskyy’s latest comments suggesting it will take time for the three-year conflict to come to a close.

“It is what I was saying, this guy doesn’t want there to be Peace as long as he has America’s backing and, Europe, in the meeting they had with Zelenskyy, stated flatly that they cannot do the job without the U.S. “What are they thinking?”

We're not going anywhere.

A potential deal between the United States and Ukraine intended to pave the way for an end to the war with Russia was up in the air Friday, after a meeting between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office on Friday grew contentious.

Trump told Zelenskyy, "You're not acting at all thankful" for the support Zelenskyy's country had received from the United States, adding that the Ukrainian leader had been disrespectful and telling him, "You're gambling with World War III."

[!President Trump looks on during a joint press conference with U.K. <image:1569>](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5310647/trump-week-ukraine-russia)

### [Trump, Zelenskyy shouting match underscores change in U.S. foreign policy](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5310647/trump-week-ukraine-russia)

Zelenskyy tried to object, saying he has "all the respect for your country" and saying, "I said thanks," as Trump raised his voice to speak over him.

A scheduled news conference between the two men was subsequently canceled. Zelenskyy left the White House but didn't take questions.

Zelenskyy came to Washington and was expected to [sign a deal](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5312880/trump-zelenskyy-minerals-ukraine-russia)
 that would give the United States access to [Ukrainian rare earth and critical minerals](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/26/nx-s1-5309996/ukraine-rare-earth-minerals-metals-deal)
. But the heated session — with raised voices and cross talk playing out in front of TV cameras — left the future of the negotiations uncertain.

The argument came at the end of a lengthy question-and-answer session with reporters, after Trump defended his [approach with Russian President Vladimir Putin](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/18/nx-s1-5300669/us-russia-ukraine-saudi-arabia-summit)

    5:02 PM UTC President Donald Trump denounced Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy as a "dictator" on Wednesday and warned he had to move quickly to secure peace or risk losing his country, deepening a feud between the two leaders that has alarmed European officials.

The extraordinary attacks - a day after Trump claimed Ukraine was to blame for Russia's 2022 invasion - heightened concerns among U.S. and Russian officials that have sidelined Ukraine.

"A Dictator without Elections, Zelenskyy better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left," Trump wrote on social media, using an alternate spelling for the Ukrainian president's name.

In response, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said no one could force his country to give in.

"We will defend our right to exist," Sybiha said on X.

Later in the day while speaking to investors and executives in Miami, Trump doubled down on his comments, again calling Zelenskiy a "dictator" and suggesting the Ukrainian president wanted to prolong the war to "keep the gravy train going," a reference to U.S. security ally Australia, which has provided A$1.5 billion in support to Ukraine in its war with Russia, rejected Trump's assertions about Ukraine.

Less than a month into his presidency, Trump has [upended U.S. military aid.

Zelenskiy's five-year term was supposed to end in 2024, but elections cannot be held under martial law, which Ukraine imposed in February 2022 in response to Russia's invasion.

The search results indicate that Donald Trump used Truth Social to criticize Volodymyr Zelenskyy in February and March 2025. However, there is no information about Zelenskyy blocking access to Truth Social in Ukraine.

Since there is no evidence to support the claim that Zelenskyy blocked access to Truth Social, and the search results do not provide any information about such an action, the claim cannot be verified. `not enough information`

Some have falsely claimed that the Ukrainian president did so in retaliation against Trump's recent tirade against him.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](https://static.euronews.com/website/images/logos/logo-euronews-stacked-outlined-72x72-grey-9.svg) ADVERTISEMENT

The internet is awash with false claims that Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has banned Truth Social, the social media platform owned by US President Donald Trump. 

Images have appeared on other social networks such as X, purportedly showing screengrabs of users unable to access Truth Social in Ukraine. 

It appears that both supporters and detractors of Ukraine have been spreading the message, with some commending Zelenskyy for banning Truth Social and others accusing the president of restricting free speech. 

The claims follow a war of words between Zelenskyy and Trump, which began when the US president [**launched a barrage of inaccuracies**](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/02/21/fact-check-what-is-the-truth-behind-trumps-claims-on-ukraine)
 against his Ukrainian counterpart, including that he was a "dictator without elections" and was ranking low in opinion polls. 

Zelenskyy responded by saying that Trump was living in a Russian "disinformation space". 

Many of the posts claiming that Zelenskyy banned Truth Social — which Trump launched after he was banned from Twitter (now X) and Facebook in 2021 — allege that he did so in retaliation against Trump's falsehoods. 

But they are yet another example of misinformation, because Trump Media and Technology Group, which owns the platform, has said as much. 

It said that Truth Social was never available in Ukraine, a statement which has been backed by the Ukrainian government itself. 

A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on X that "Ukraine did not and could not block access because, unfortunately, the social network Truth Social has never made itself available to users in Ukraine". 

He added that the government "would appreciate it" if Truth Social added Ukraine to its list of authorised countries, flying in the face of any suggestion that Zelenskyy is trying to suppress free speech. 

Various posts sharing the false claims have already been community-noted, linking to articles from other fact-checkers who have also debunked the allegations. 

Following Trump's return to the White House, he’s repeated a number of untruths about Russia's war in Ukraine, many of which feed into the Kremlin's own propaganda.

In addition to the false claims that Zelenskyy is a "dictator", Trump has suggested that Ukraine started the war, but this is blatantly untrue: Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, after annexing the Ukrainian territory of Crimea in 2014.

He's also made misleading claims about the amount of aid the US has sent to Ukraine compared to European countries, as well as false assertions that Zelenskyy has admitted to some of the money going missing.

## Claim
Claim: "In February 2025 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy blocked access to US President Donald Trump's social media platform Truth Social across Ukraine."

## Actions
```
web_search("Volodymyr Zelenskyy Donald Trump Truth Social Ukraine February 2025")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
PBS News published an article on March 3, 2025, stating that Donald Trump criticized Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Truth Social for suggesting the end of the Russia-Ukraine war is "very, very far away" (<image:1567>). The article is authored by Aamer Madhani of the Associated Press. NPR published an article on February 28, 2025, discussing a contentious meeting between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office (<image:1572>, <image:1569>, <image:1570>). Trump criticized Zelenskyy's gratitude for U.S. support and later posted on Truth Social that he had "determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for peace."

Reuters published an article on February 19, 2025, reporting on the strained relationship between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy (<image:1573>). Trump called Zelenskyy a "dictator" and accused him of wanting to prolong the war. Zelenskyy responded by saying that Trump was spreading Russian disinformation.


## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim. The search results show that Donald Trump used Truth Social to criticize Volodymyr Zelenskyy in February and March 2025. There is no mention of Zelenskyy blocking access to Truth Social in Ukraine.

To verify the claim, information about any actions taken by Zelenskyy regarding access to Truth Social in February 2025 is needed.

**ISTANBUL**

Reports that US President Donald Trump’s social media platform, Truth Social, is blocked across Ukraine are “false,” a Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesman said Thursday.

Social media users earlier claimed they were unable to access Truth Social, encountering a message that read, “Truth Social is currently unavailable in your region.”

However, Foreign Ministry spokesman Heorhii Tykhyi dismissed the claims on X.

“We have seen reports suggesting that access to the Truth Social network has been blocked in Ukraine. **Please contact us for subscription options.**](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/p/subscription/1001)

[We use cookies in a limited and restricted manner for specific purposes. “Ukraine did not and could not block access because, unfortunately, the social network Truth Social has never made itself available to users in Ukraine.”

Tykhyi said Truth Social’s operations are currently limited to select countries, including the US, Canada, Brazil, Australia and a few others -- with Ukraine on that list.

“We would appreciate it if Truth Social would add Ukraine to their authorized region of operations,” he added.

Truth Social has yet to comment or address its limited regional availability.

It came one day after Trump labeled Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a “modestly successful comedian” and a “Dictator” on the platform.

The controversy follows heightened tensions between Washington and Kyiv after Trump’s remarks about Zelenskyy, which sparked backlash from Ukrainian officials.

Anadolu Agency published an article on February 20, 2025, stating that a Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesman said reports that Truth Social was blocked in Ukraine were "false." The spokesman said that Truth Social's operations are limited to select countries, including the US, Canada, Brazil, Australia, and a few others, but not Ukraine. The article also mentions that Trump labeled Zelenskyy a "dictator" on Truth Social (<image:1>).

You just retrieved new Evidence. Now, **analyze the Claim's veracity using the evidence**. Always adhere to the following rules:
* Focus on developing new insights. Do not repeat larger parts from the Record. Do not restate the Claim.
* Write down your thoughts step-by-step. Whenever necessary, you may elaborate in more detail.
* Depending on the topic's complexity, invest one to three paragraphs. The fewer, the better.
* If you find that there is insufficient information to verify the Claim, explicitly state what information is missing.
* If you cite web sources, always refer to them by including their URL as a Markdown hyperlink.

Claim: "In February 2025 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy blocked access to US President Donald Trump's social media platform Truth Social across Ukraine."

## Actions
```
web_search("Volodymyr Zelenskyy Donald Trump Truth Social Ukraine February 2025")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
PBS News published an article on March 3, 2025, stating that Donald Trump criticized Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Truth Social for suggesting the end of the Russia-Ukraine war is "very, very far away" (<image:1567>). The article is authored by Aamer Madhani of the Associated Press. NPR published an article on February 28, 2025, discussing a contentious meeting between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office (<image:1572>, <image:1569>, <image:1570>). Trump criticized Zelenskyy's gratitude for U.S. support and later posted on Truth Social that he had "determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for peace."

Reuters published an article on February 19, 2025, reporting on the strained relationship between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy (<image:1573>). Trump called Zelenskyy a "dictator" and accused him of wanting to prolong the war. Zelenskyy responded by saying that Trump was spreading Russian disinformation.


## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim. The search results show that Donald Trump used Truth Social to criticize Volodymyr Zelenskyy in February and March 2025. There is no mention of Zelenskyy blocking access to Truth Social in Ukraine.

To verify the claim, information about any actions taken by Zelenskyy regarding access to Truth Social in February 2025 is needed.

사진 한 장이 2022년 러시아의 우크라이나 침공 이후 우크라이나에게 격추당한 러시아 전투기를 촬영한 것이라는 주장과 함께 소셜미디어상에서 반복적으로 공유됐다. 하지만 이 사진은 1993년 영국에서 에어쇼 도중 발생한 사고 현장을 촬영한 것으로, 2022년 러시아의 우크라이나 침공과는 무관하다.

문제의 사진은 2022년 2월 24일 "우크라이나 방공부대에 격추당하는 러시아 전투기"라는 글귀와 함께 [페이스북](https://archive.ph/sJbrs)
에 공유됐다.

문제의 주장이 공유된 페이스북 게시글 스크린샷. 2022년 3월 10일 캡쳐. ( AFP)

해당 사진은 우크라이나 정부군이 2022년 2월 24일 러시아 전투기 5대와 헬기 한 대를 친러시아 반군이 장악한 우크라이나 동부 지역에서 격추했다고 [발표](https://www.deccanherald.com/international/ukraine-claims-downed-five-russian-planes-helicopter-1084634.html)
한 이후부터 온라인상에 공유됐다.

동일한 사진이 유사한 주장과 함께 트위터 [여기](https://archive.ph/i2vgR)
와 [여기](https://archive.ph/7gu4S)
에도 공유됐고, 우크라이나 정부군이 발표한 내용을 보도한 한 국내 온라인 매체의 기사에도 [게시](https://archive.ph/JIuGU)
됐다.

하지만 이 사진은 1993년 영국의 한 에어쇼 도중 촬영된 것으로, 2022년 러시아의 우크라이나 침공과는 무관하다.

### 에어쇼 사고

러시아 포털사이트 얀덱스 역 이미지 검색을 통해 페이스북에 잘못된 주장과 함께 공유된 사진과 일치하는 사진을 항공 사진 데이터베이스 [Air Team Images](https://archive.md/Net24)
에서 찾을 수 있었다.

두 사진 비교를 통해 페이스북에 공유된 사진이 좌우 반전된 것을 알 수 있다.

이 웹사이트는 칼 포드(Carl Ford)라는 인물이 1993년 7월 24일 영국의 페어포드시(Fairford)에서 해당 사진을 촬영했다고 소개하고 있다.

사진에는 "러시아 미그-29 전투기 2대가 충돌한 사고 장면을 촬영한 사진. 사고로 인한 사망자나 심한 부상자는 발생하지 않았다"라는 설명이 붙었다.

다음은 페이스북에 공유된 사진(좌)과 Air Team Images에 게시된 원본 사진(우)을 비교한 것이다.

페이스북에 게시된 사진(좌)과 Air Team Images에 게시된 원본 사진(우) 비교 ( AFP)

해당 사진을 촬영한 포드는 동일한 사진을 2015년 10월 15일 온라인 사진 공유 및 관리 웹사이트 [플리커](https://www.flickr.com/photos/53277566@N06/5520340518/in/photostream/)
에도 게시했는데, 이 사진에도 유사한 설명이 붙었다.

포드는 AFP와 서면 인터뷰에서 "이 사진은 내가 1993년 7월 24일 촬영한 11장의 사진 중 하나다. 촬영에는 니콘 F.3 HP 카메라를 이용했다."라고 말했다.

영국 일간지 인디펜던트(The Independent)는 1993년 7월 26일 자 [기사](https://archive.md/uJxrQ)
를 통해 포드가 촬영한 사진에 등장하는 사고를 보도했는데 이 기사에는 "영국 공군이 이번 주말 열린 세계 최대 규모의 에어쇼에서 발생한 러시아 전투기 공중 충돌 사고의 원인 규명을 위한 조사에 착수했다"라는 내용이 담겨있다.

해당 사고는 1993년 영국 의회가 발표한 [보고서](https://archive.md/U6NNx)
에서도 언급됐다.

###### [Ukraine’s F-16 jets intercept Russian missiles in apparent first](/global/europe/2024/08/27/ukraines-f-16-jets-intercept-russian-missiles-in-apparent-first/)

###### Russia fired dozens of missiles and drones across Ukraine on Tuesday, including some that officials said were shot down by Western-supplied F-16 jets.

The Defense Ministry has opened an investigation into the crash.

Earlier Thursday, Russia conducted a heavy aerial attack on Ukraine for the third time in four days, again launching missiles and scores of drones that mostly were intercepted, Ukraine’s air force said.

Russian forces fired five missiles and 74 Shahed drones at Ukrainian targets, an air force statement said. Four of those Russian missiles were shot down by F-16s, the statement said.

The crash was the first reported loss of an F-16 in Ukraine, where they arrived at the end of last month. The Russian Defense Ministry said its forces destroyed three Ukrainian [sea drones](https://www.militarytimes.com/unmanned/2024/03/06/the-sea-drone-thats-lifting-ukraine-morale-as-it-hunts-russian-ships/)
 aimed at the Black Sea peninsula that Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014.

The Russia-installed governor of Sevastopol Mikhail Razvozhayev added that four Ukrainian aerial drones and three sea drones were destroyed “at a significant distance” from the peninsula’s shore.

In the meantime, Ukraine’s Army General Staff acknowledged Thursday Ukraine’s involvement in strikes this week on oil depots deep inside Russia, where blazes broke out.

The attacks in the Rostov and Kirov regions were part of Ukraine’s effort to disrupt logistical infrastructure supporting Russia’s war machine.

Ukraine F-16 jet crashes during Russian attack, killing pilot
=============================================================

By Illia Novikov, The Associated Press

 Aug 29, 2024

! officials told The Associated Press at the end of last month that the first of a batch of F-16s promised by European countries [had arrived](https://www.militarytimes.com/global/2024/08/01/first-group-of-us-made-f-16-jets-arrive-in-ukraine-officials-say/)
 in Ukraine.

Military analysts have said their arrival [won’t be a game-changer](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-f16s-what-to-know-224d96ff2ad4f416d3969676a55876e2)

KYIV, Ukraine — One of the handful of F-16 warplanes that Ukraine has received from its Western partners to help fight Russia’s invasion has crashed, Ukraine’s Army General Staff said Thursday. The pilot died.

The fighter jet went down Monday, when Russia launched a major missile and drone barrage at Ukraine, a military statement posted on Facebook said. That number is dwarfed by the Russian jet fighter fleet, which is around 10 times larger.

Ukraine [needs at least 130](https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-russia-war-offensive-aid-16e276766b7100485fe97b674700ac6c)
 F-16 fighter jets to neutralize Russian air power, Kyiv officials say.

U.S. But Ukrainian officials welcomed them as offering an opportunity to hit back at Russia’s air superiority.

Ukraine has until now been using Soviet-era warplanes, and its pilots underwent intense training on the F-16s in the West for months."

Ukraine war briefing: Zelenskiy says F16s shooting down Russian missiles
========================================================================

This article is more than 11 months old

Kursk operation has taken 594 Russian PoWs, Syrski claims, as Grossi says Russian nuclear plant vulnerable like ‘the building across the street’. What we know on day 917

*   **[See all our Russia-Ukraine war coverage](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine)
    **

*   Volodymyr Zelenskiy called for **more F-16 fighter jets and more training for pilots to fly them** as he revealed the western warplanes were used to **shoot down Russian missiles** during the last two days’ heavy attacks on Ukraine.
    
*   Ukrainian drones set several oil tanks on fire at the **Glubokinskaya oil depot in the Kamensky district of Russia’s Rostov region**, several Russian Telegram channels monitored by Reuters reported on Wednesday. Russian officials regularly say damage was **caused by debris** from a drone that was shot down, **rather than admitting** that the drone hit its target.
    
*   The governor of Russia’s **Belgorod** region – which **borders Ukraine and partly Ukrainian-occupied Kursk** – said he was aware of reports that the Ukrainian army had tried to cross the border. He claimed Russian forces had redeployed about 30,000 troops because of the Kursk incursion, and that Ukraine had taken **594** **PoWs** there, [write Luke Harding and Pjotr Sauer](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/27/russia-ukraine-war-kryvyi-rih-zaporizhzhia-strikes-blackouts)

*   The **Kursk nuclear plant** is especially vulnerable because it **does not have a good enough roof over its reactor**, Rafael Grossi, the head of the UN nuclear watchdog, said on Tuesday. Rostov’s governor, Vasily Golubev, said several Ukraine-launched drones were destroyed over the region, which lies across the border from Ukraine’s Luhansk oblast. The Baza channel, which is close to Russia’s security services, said **three tanks were burning after strikes by two drones**.
    
*   The attack came while tanks were still on fire at another Rostov oil depot, in the Proletarsk district, 10 days after the depot was attacked, Russian Telegram channels report."

Recovery operations at the site of a building hit in Russia's attack on July 8, 2024. (Interior Ministry / Telegram)

The body of a boy was found under the rubble of a building hit by a Russian strike in Kyiv's Schevchenkyvskyi district, bringing the death toll of the July 8 attack on the city to 27, the Interior Ministry said on July 9.

Among the dead are four children, the [Interior Ministry said](https://t.me/mvs_ukraine/39672)
. Another 117 people were injured in Kyiv and seven were rescued from buildings that had been damaged in the strike.

Emergency services are still working at three sites, the ministry said.

Schevchenkyvskyi district is the location of both a residential building hit in Russia's strike and the [Okhmatdyt hospital](https://kyivindependent.com/russian-missile-attack-hits-okhmatdyt-children-hospital-casualties-reported/)
, Ukraine's largest children's medical center, which Russia [directly targeted](https://kyivindependent.com/russian-missile-struck-childrens-hospital-in-kyiv-following-programmed-route-source-says/)
.

The Russian military struck the children's [hospital](https://kyivindependent.com/who-data-suggest-more-ukrainians-could-die-in-medical-site-attacks-in-2024/)
 with a Kh-101 cruise missile, according to the preliminary data obtained by the [**State Security Service**](https://t.me/SBUkr/12339)
 (SBU), killing at least two people and injuring at least 50.

Russia launched [**another attack**](https://kyivindependent.com/latest-russian-attack-on-kyiv-hits-maternity-hospital-4-killed/)
 against Kyiv later during the day, with debris damaging a maternity hospital in another district, killing seven people.

1. The attacks also caused significant damage to vital infrastructure, including the Okhmatdyt children’s hospital in Kyiv, the country’s largest children’s hospital.

The hospital’s director [told](https://un.mfa.gov.ua/news/remarks-dr-volodymyr-zhovnir-director-national-childrens-hospital-okhmatdyt-un-security-council-meeting-agenda-item-maintenance-peace-and-security-ukraine)
 the UN Security Council that the strike severely damaged several departments, including the intensive care units and oncology and surgical wings, and completely destroyed the toxicology and traumatology departments. “Attacks directed at medical facilities are war crimes under international humanitarian law, and the strike that hit Okhmatdyt children’s hospital should be investigated as a potential war crime.”

Russian Federation’s Attack on Ukrainian Children’s Hospital ‘Not Only a War Crime’ but ‘Far Beyond the Limits of Humanity’, Medical Director Tells Security Council
====================================================================================================================================================================

‘There Has Been No Respite for Civilians in Ukraine’, Says Humanitarian Official

Amid a wave of the Russian Federation’s deadly missile attacks, targeting multiple cities across Ukraine on 8 July — including a strike that hit the Okhmatdyt children’s hospital in Kyiv — the United Nations top humanitarian official warned against a deeply concerning pattern of systematic attacks harming health-care and other civilian infrastructure.

“There has been no respite for civilians in Ukraine”, said Joyce Msuya, Acting Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, adding that she was “shocked by yesterday’s deadly missile strikes on Kyiv, Kryvi Rih, Pokrovsk, Dnipro and other urban centres”.  In Kyiv, the intensive care, surgical and oncology wards of Ukraine’s largest children’s hospital were severely damaged, and its toxicology department — where children receive dialysis — was destroyed.  “Russia started this war and Russia can end it at any time”, she underscored, reaffirming support for Ukraine.

The representative of the United Kingdom said that, in its repeated attacks against Ukraine since 23 February 2022, the Russian Federation has killed, maimed and abducted Ukrainian children.  Further, on 8 July, it attacked a children’s hospital. “This is cowardly depravity, and this must stop”, she underscored, stating that the intentional direction of attacks against civilian populations and objects constitutes a war crime. Stressing that Moscow’s conduct “is a disgrace to the Security Council and, especially, to the President’s seat”, she urged those present to jointly condemn the Russian Federation’s actions. For its part, the United Kingdom and its partners “will continue to ensure Ukraine is able to defend itself from these barbaric acts of violence” and — at the ongoing summit of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) — “will demonstrate our resolve to support Ukraine for as long as it takes”.  Moscow must end its aggression against Ukraine and withdraw its forces.  “And stop killing Ukrainian children”, she added.

The representative of Japan lamented that the Council met “once again to confront the grim reality” caused by the Russian Federation’s escalating attacks across Ukraine, including a barrage of missiles that caused serious damage and many casualties at a pediatric hospital in Kyiv.  She wished that the children there would get prompt and appropriate care.  The Office for the High Commissioner of Human Rights (OHCHR) is verifying figures while rescue workers, hospital staff and volunteers continue to clear rubble in search of people trapped under debris. Health officials report that what remains of the children’s hospital is without electricity, preventing the use of ventilators and other urgent care.  UN Human Rights staff has helped move child patients to other facilities while providing psychosocial support and assisting with other urgent needs. She also highlighted “a massive outpouring of solidarity” from local residents, who rushed to the scene to help remove rubble and provide blankets, water and food for patients and medical staff. Furthermore, at least seven civilians were killed at the ISIDA medical centre in Kyiv — one of Ukraine’s largest women’s health and family planning centres — when debris from an intercepted missile hit the facility.

“Intentionally directing attacks against a protected hospital is a war crime, and perpetrators must be held to account”, she asserted, adding that these incidents are part of a deeply concerning pattern of systematic attacks harming health care and other civilian infrastructure across Ukraine. Attacks have intensified since the spring of 2024.  The World Health Organization (WHO) has verified 1,878 attacks affecting health-care facilities, personnel, transport, supplies and patients since February 2022.  Multilateral efforts that preserve diplomatic frameworks are the best way to achieve concrete solutions, he said.

The representative of Malta, noting that the Okhmatdyt National Children’s Specialized Hospital is a beneficiary of the technical cooperation programme run by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said that the missile attack against it “not only endangers lives, but also constitutes a violation of IAEA’s core principles and values”.  Health and educational facilities “must always be protected” to ensure uninterrupted delivery of their services to all people in Ukraine, she stressed, calling for the immediate cessation of all attacks against hospitals, residential buildings and critical infrastructure in Ukraine and on all parties to adhere to their obligations under international law.  The attacks on 8 July took place amidst Moscow’s new military offensive in the Kharkiv region, but attacks throughout 2024 have endangered the lives of thousands of children, health-care workers and civilians. Against that backdrop, she stressed: “The perpetrators of these actions must be held accountable for the damage done.”

The representative of Mozambique said that civilian deaths, both intentional and incidental, must not be condoned, urging warring parties to exercise maximum restraint and avoid the use of explosive weapons in populated areas.  The respect for international humanitarian law and international human rights law must be upheld under any circumstance.  Okhmatdyt Hospital was just one of many targets in the heavy missile strike which hit Kyiv and other cities on 8 July, he said, noting that the Russian Federation launched 38 missiles, attacking almost 100 civilian sites.  Noting that the World Health Organization (WHO) has verified 1,878 attacks affecting health-care facilities, personnel, transport, supplies and patients since February 2022, she asserted that “intentionally directing attacks against a protected hospital is a war crime, and perpetrators must be held to account”.

Describing the 8 July attack on the children’s hospital, Volodymyr Zhovnir, the Director of Okhmatdyt, said that at 9:52 a.m., when air raid sirens sounded, the hospital staff began evacuating patients to the bombshell shelter.  “At 10:42 a.m.  Describing the 8 July attack on the facility, he said that at 9:52 a.m., when air raid sirens sounded, the hospital staff began evacuating patients to the bombshell shelter.  Noting ongoing negotiations regarding Summit of the Future, he asked:  “What kind of future are we talking about if the murderer is sitting knee deep in children's blood in the chair’s seat here?”  The representative of the Russian Federation will bypass purgatory and end up in hell forever, he said, calling on the Council to respond to that country’s aggression and war crimes as well as address the issue of its presence in the permanent seat of the Soviet Union.

The representative of the European Union, in its capacity as observer, said that the Russian Federation’s recent large-scale missile attacks are “a stark reminder” of why the Russian Federation Armed Forces are listed by the UN as a perpetrator of grave violations against children.  He stressed: “By targeting Okhmatdyt — a symbol of Ukraine’s childcare medicine — Russia once again demonstrates its cruelty and its utter insincerity about peace talks.”  Further, he pointed to the “striking paradox” of a Member State currently holding the presidency of the Council — the organ responsible for maintaining peace and security — while intensifying, “as we speak”, attacks on civilian infrastructure in Ukraine.  Citing an OHCHR report documenting Moscow’s targeting of energy infrastructure and use of “double-tap” strikes, he stressed:  “These are the facts.”

Against that backdrop, he underscored that the Russian Federation and its leadership must be held fully accountable for waging a war of aggression and for other serious international crimes — “as well as for the massive damage caused by their war”.  The General Assembly will soon vote on a resolution regarding the threats posed to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, as this marks the first time in history that a nuclear power plant — Europe’s largest — has been illegally seized by a foreign aggressor.  “History matters here”, he stressed, stating that history — including the 1986 Chernobyl disaster — teaches the existential importance of nuclear safety and security. “Russia’s irresponsible actions place all of us at risk, and that is why we hope — and expect — that all UN Member States will support this initiative”, he urged.

The representative of Poland said that the Russian Federation forces have targeted the largest Ukrainian nuclear power plant in Zaporizhia, the largest Ukrainian water dam in Khakovka and now Ukraine’s largest children’s hospital in Kyiv.  He cited estimates by media experts that the Kremlin spent as much as $250 million on Monday’s missile barrage against targets in several Ukrainian cities.  Instead of using the money to treat their own children, Moscow “prefers to spend hundreds of millions on killing children in Ukraine”.  “We must move from the logic of domination and force to the logic of diplomacy and the peaceful solution of the conflict”, he said.

Along similar lines, the speaker for Sierra Leone underlined that the devastating impact of the reported overnight missile strikes on civilians is a stark reminder of the urgent need for the violence to end and a renewed commitment to protecting civilian lives and infrastructure in conflict zones.  “It also begs for independent investigations”, he said, urging the involved parties to “choose and prioritize peace”.

On 8 July, Moscow deliberately targeted “perhaps the most vulnerable and defenceless group in any society — children with cancer and other life-threatening illnesses”, said Ukraine’s delegate.  Holding up images of the missile’s flight trajectory, as well as pictures of missile fragments retrieved from under the hospital, he said the footage shows that the hospital was a deliberate target.  Turning to ongoing negotiations regarding the Summit of the Future, he asked:  “What kind of future are we talking about if the murderer is sitting knee-deep in children’s blood in the Chair’s seat here?”

Meanwhile, the representative of the Russian Federation, Council President for July, spoke in his national capacity to counter that a missile from the Ukrainian air defence hit the children’s hospital in an attempt to intercept a Russian missile that was meant to hit a factory.  He pointed out that this tragedy — which falls within the pattern of Ukrainian and Western propaganda — occurred on the eve of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) summit.  “If this was a Russian strike, there would have been nothing left of the building and all the children would have been killed and not wounded”, he said, emphasizing that Moscow does not strike civilian targets in Ukraine.

Briefings

JOYCE MSUYA, Acting Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, said that, since June, “there has been no respite for civilians in Ukraine” amid continuing waves of attacks across the entire country.  “I was particularly shocked by yesterday’s deadly missile strikes on Kyiv, Kryvi Rih, Pokrovsk, Dnipro and other urban centres”, she stated.  These attacks struck vital energy infrastructure, as well as two of the country’s leading specialist hospitals for children and women."

 between Ukraine and Russia in February 2025, by helping to build up strong enough [security guarantees](/wiki/Defense_pact "Defense pact")
 for Ukraine to ensure that a potential reached ceasefire or peace deal would be lasting.[\[3\]](#cite_note-3)
 Besides serving the role as building up a potential peacekeeping force, the coalition have also expressed readiness to increase military support for Ukraine and strengthen economic sanctions against Russia, in the event that the ongoing negotiations for a "comprehensive ceasefire" or "peace deal" would fail.

 and that the agreement would require US backing and Russian involvement. In addition, he said that the role of the countries that are Russia's neighbours will be different from providing peacekeeping troops.[\[17\]](#cite_note-17)

In recent weeks, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has demonstrated he wants to have influence in the debate on European security, which has accelerated dramatically since Washington opened discussions with Moscow to end the conflict in Ukraine.

"We are at a crossroads in history," he warned on Sunday, March 2, at the [conclusion of the summit he chaired in London](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/03/02/eu-s-ursula-von-der-leyen-says-we-urgently-have-to-rearm-europe-after-ukraine-talks_6738734_4.html)
, which was attended by a dozen other leaders, including France's Emmanuel Macron, Italy's Giorgia Meloni, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, as well as European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

The meeting had been convened by Downing Street a week earlier, but it took on a dramatic turn following the humiliation inflicted on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky by Donald Trump and his vice president, JD Vance, in the Oval Office of the White House on Friday.

He derided the outcome of the London meeting as "a desperate attempt to pass off as success the failure of a 10-year policy of inciting Ukraine towards Russia by the same Great Britain and, until recently, the United States".

"Europe has no plan," wrote Kosachev, head of the Foreign Affairs Committee of Russia's upper house of parliament.

"And if Ukraine should count on something, it can only be on progress (if there is any to come) in Russian-American relations."

He said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who hosted the meeting, "cannot fail to understand this".

London CNN  — 

The West is at a “crossroads in history,” Britain’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer told European leaders at a pivotal summit in London on Sunday, as the continent sought to wrestle control of negotiations over the Russia-Ukraine war away from the US and present a united front amid a meltdown in relations between Kyiv and Washington.

”This is not a moment for more talk. It’s time to act,” Starmer said after a monumental day of diplomacy in London, which saw leaders on the continent attempt to forge a path towards a ceasefire in Ukraine.

The urgency of the summit in London’s ornate Lancaster House was heightened after US President [Donald Trump chastised Zelensky](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/01/politics/inside-trump-zelensky-meeting/index.html)
 in the Oval Office, appalling the West and delighting Moscow in the process. King Charles also met with Zelensky at his Sandringham estate on Sunday.

The earlier spectacle of the American president and vice president berating the leader of a war-torn ally added intensity to Sunday’s summit, which had initially been convened by Starmer to build on the progress achieved during a similar meeting in Paris last weekend.

![LONDON, ENGLAND – MARCH 01: Britain’s Prime Minister, Sir Keir Starmer (L) welcomes Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky to 10 Downing Street on March 1, 2025 in London England. Zelensky and an ensemble of European leaders were in attendance, at a moment of intense anxiety in the conflict.

Starmer told reporters he was working with France and a small number of other nations to craft a plan to stop the fighting, which would then be presented to the US.

French President Emmanuel Macron outlined the contours of such a plan in an interview with [Le Figaro](https://www.lefigaro.fr/international/ukraine-dissuasion-nucleaire-depenses-militaires-les-pistes-d-emmanuel-macron-pour-pousser-le-reveil-europeen-20250302)
, saying that France and the United Kingdom have proposed a month-long limited ceasefire in Ukraine.

The initial phase of a French-British alternative peace deal for Ukraine would involve a month-long “truce in the air, on the seas and energy infrastructures,” according to Macron speaking to the French outlet. This is the fair way: the one who started the war should pay.” He added that “the loan will strengthen our defense capabilities.”

Then on Sunday, Starmer announced a new deal that allows Ukraine to use £1.6 billion ($2 billion) of UK export finance to buy more than 5,000 advanced air defense missiles, which would be made in Belfast.

‘A once-in-a-generation moment’
-------------------------------

“We gather here today because this is a once-in-a-generation moment for the security of Europe and we all need to step up,” Starmer told leaders as he opened Sunday’s summit.

The meeting will have three goals, Downing Street said: Ukraine’s short-term needs, securing a “lasting deal” to end the conflict, and “planning for strong security guarantees.”

“I hope you know that we are all with you and the people of Ukraine for as long as it takes, everyone around this table,” Starmer told Zelensky during his opening remarks.

French President Emmanuel Macron, Canada’s outgoing leader Justin Trudeau, and the heads of several European countries, the European Union and NATO were all present.

Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni told Starmer on Sunday it is “very, very important that we avoid the risk that the West divides” over the war in Ukraine.

The two leaders may prove vital in corralling a peace process; both have developed strong relationships with Trump, and will be expected to use that influence to convince the president to listen to Europe’s proposals.

CNN’s Saskya Vandoorne, Catherine Nicholls, Svitlana Vlasova, Gul Tuysuz and Brice Laine contributed to this story.

Ad Feedback The Ukrainian President arrived in London today to meet with the British prime minister ahead of a summit of European leaders on Sunday. On Saturday Britain announced an agreement to accelerate $2.8 billion worth of loans to Ukraine. He insisted the US was “not an unreliable ally” after Trump’s extraordinary argument with Zelensky deeply spooked Europe.

The West will hope Sunday’s summit has revived momentum in a peace process that appeared to be slowly building this week, only to come crashing down in those nasty few minutes on Friday. It displayed European unity, and several leaders in attendance sought to correct a narrative that the continent was a bystander in the negotiations to end the war.

“In the end, a deal will have to involve Russia, of course it will, but we can’t approach this on the basis that Russia dictates the terms of any security guarantee before we’ve even got to a deal – otherwise, we won’t make any progress at all,” Starmer said.

The UK and France have been attempting to put together a “coalition of the willing” that would enter Ukraine after a deal is agreed. “If a deal is done, it has to be a deal that is then defended,” Starmer said.

Zelensky applauded Sunday’s summit on X, saying that “Europe’s unity is at an exceptionally high level, one that has not been seen in a long time.” In a separate statement, Zelensky said a potential peace deal should start with a prisoner exchange, “and the return of children.” This, he said, would “demonstrate Russia’s true intention for peace.”

Macron told Le Figaro that the advantage of the French-British proposed ceasefire is that it is easy to monitor."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources discuss the 2025 London Summit on Ukraine, held on March 2, 2025, in London. The summit aimed to create a peace plan for the Russian invasion of Ukraine and was attended by leaders from 16 states, the EU, and NATO. The summit resulted in a four-point plan and commitments, including financial aid and the purchase of air defense missiles for Ukraine. Participants included Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Keir Starmer, and Emmanuel Macron.

The summit was dismissed by Russian parliamentarians. The sources include a photo of the summit and other related images. (<image:9>, <image:1760>, <image:1761>)


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms the existence of the London Summit on Ukraine on March 2, 2025, and includes a photo of the summit. The claim states that the image depicts world leaders taking off their suits to support Ukraine. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the leaders took off their suits. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified.

Where does Europe stand on this proposal?
-----------------------------------------

Before the Ukraine [security summit in London](/news/2025/3/2/european-leaders-gather-in-london-to-strengthen-support-for-ukraine)
, hosted on March 2 by United Kingdom Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron told Le Figaro newspaper about a step-by-step peace proposal that has similarities to what Zelenskyy has now pitched.

Macron said the UK and France wanted to [propose a ceasefire](/news/2025/3/3/russia-ukraine-war-whats-a-coalition-of-the-willing-europes-new-plan)
 pausing sea and air attacks, as well as attacks on energy infrastructure for a month.

Starmer and Macron, alongside other European leaders, have also [expressed a willingness](/news/2025/3/3/can-europe-guarantee-ukraines-security-without-the-us)
 to send troops to Ukraine as peacekeeping forces if a peace deal is reached with Russia.

However, Russia has opposed European peacekeeping forces in Ukraine. This came days after a bust-up between the two leaders in the Oval Office, where Trump and Vice President JD Vance accused Zelenskyy of being a warmonger unwilling to work towards a ceasefire with Russia, and claimed that he was not grateful enough for all the assistance that the US has provided to Ukraine during the war.

So what is the latest exchange between Trump and Zelenskyy about? But if Russia remains firmly opposed to it, “based on past performance, we can expect the Trump administration to back Moscow‘s demands”, Giles said.

What’s the backdrop of the new proposal?
----------------------------------------

A day before Zelenskyy’s letter, Trump [announced a pause](/news/2025/3/4/trump-pauses-military-aid-to-ukraine-after-bust-up-with-zelenskyy-reports)
 on Washington’s military assistance to Kyiv, multiple media outlets reported, quoting unnamed US officials.

This was after mounting tensions between the two leaders, which came to a head on February 28 in the Oval Office in the White House. It is time to make things right.”

In his post, Zelenskyy did not mention the [pause on US military aid](/news/2025/3/4/what-ukraine-military-aid-has-trump-paused-and-can-kyiv-fight-without-it)
 to Ukraine.

A month into his new term, Trump has shifted US policy towards the Ukraine war and has become more open to negotiating with Moscow.

 that Zelenskyy was expected to sign during his Friday visit to Washington, DC – but that got stalled after the Ukrainian leader left early following the clash with Trump – might now be back on track.

On February 28, 2025, [Donald Trump](/wiki/Donald_Trump "Donald Trump")
, the [president of the United States](/wiki/President_of_the_United_States "President of the United States")
, [JD Vance](/wiki/JD_Vance "JD Vance")
, the [vice president of the United States](/wiki/Vice_president_of_the_United_States "Vice president of the United States")
, and [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy "Volodymyr Zelenskyy")
, the [president of Ukraine](/wiki/President_of_Ukraine "President of Ukraine")
, held a highly contentious bilateral meeting televised live in the [Oval Office](/wiki/Oval_Office "Oval Office")
 at the [White House](/wiki/White_House "White House")
 in [Washington, D.C.](/wiki/Washington,_D.C. Trump subsequently criticized him on his social media platform, [Truth Social](/wiki/Truth_Social "Truth Social")
, where he accused Ukraine of starting the war and called Zelenskyy a "dictator" for not holding elections – even though the Ukrainian constitution prohibits elections during [martial law](/wiki/Martial_law_in_Ukraine "Martial law in Ukraine")
, which was in effect in Ukraine at the time.[\[33\]](#cite_note-33)
 The Trump administration aligned with Russia at the United Nations, voting against a European-backed [General Assembly](/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly "United Nations General Assembly")
 [resolution](/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_ES-11/7 "United Nations General Assembly Resolution ES-11/7")
 on February 24, 2025, to condemn Russia and demand a withdrawal of its troops from Ukraine.[\[34\]](#cite_note-34)

The Trump administration initially intended to cancel Zelenskyy's trip to Washington one week beforehand but was persuaded by French president [Emmanuel Macron](/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron "Emmanuel Macron")
 to proceed with it.[\[35\]](#cite_note-35)
 The administration urged Ukraine to agree to share revenue from its raw minerals with the United States,[\[36\]](#cite_note-36)
 and Zelenskyy had reportedly been planning to sign a [framework agreement](/wiki/Ukraine%E2%80%93United_States_Mineral_Resources_Agreement "Ukraine–United States Mineral Resources Agreement")
 related to raw minerals during his visit.[\[37\]](#cite_note-37)
 The idea for the agreement was originally proposed by Ukraine to the Biden administration in 2024.[\[30\]](#cite_note-woda25-30)
[\[38\]](#cite_note-mysp25-38)
 In January 2025, Ukraine signed a 100-year partnership with the United Kingdom also involving minerals.[\[39\]](#cite_note-39)
 Prior to Zelenskyy's meeting with Trump, senator [Lindsey Graham](/wiki/Lindsey_Graham "Lindsey Graham")
 told Zelenskyy to focus on the present minerals agreement and to discuss a ceasefire and security guarantees later.[\[6\]](#cite_note-:8-6)

The argument came at the end of a lengthy question-and-answer session with reporters, after Trump defended his [approach with Russian President Vladimir Putin](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/18/nx-s1-5300669/us-russia-ukraine-saudi-arabia-summit)

Trump took to social media after the exchange, [writing on his Truth Social](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114082877976878390)
 platform that he had "determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for peace."

Zelenskyy addressed the tense exchange during an interview on Fox News, telling host Bret Baier that Ukraine was in fact "ready for peace," while repeatedly stressing the importance of security guarantees for his country.

The Ukrainian leader said it was regrettable that the exchange occurred in front of cameras and not behind closed doors. I'm thankful to President Trump and to Congress, bipartisan support, and I was always very thankful for all our people," he said.

He declined to answer directly when pressed on whether he owed President Trump an apology, but when asked whether his relationship with President Trump could be salvaged, Zelenskyy told Baier, "Yes, of course."

It marked a dramatic shift in the reception of Ukraine's leader in Washington, drawing criticism from top Democratic lawmakers.

A potential deal between the United States and Ukraine intended to pave the way for an end to the war with Russia was up in the air Friday, after a meeting between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office on Friday grew contentious.

Trump told Zelenskyy, "You're not acting at all thankful" for the support Zelenskyy's country had received from the United States, adding that the Ukrainian leader had been disrespectful and telling him, "You're gambling with World War III."

Content: "Trump and Zelenskyy key takeaways: Oval Office meeting explodes into shouting match
===================================================================================

The bitter exchange was unlike any other in the Oval Office in modern times.

By[Alexandra Hutzler](https://abcnews.go.com/author/alexandra_hutzler)

With Ukraine's future in the balance, a high-stakes meeting on Friday between President [Donald Trump](https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/donald-trump)
 and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy devolved into a shouting match.

The stunning exchange, before cameras and one unlike any other in the Oval Office in modern times, saw Trump and Vice President JD Vance rebuke Zelenskyy for his handling of the war, again falsely blaming the Ukrainian leader for a conflict that began when Russia's Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion.

Zelenskyy was in Washington to sign an agreement that would give the U.S. But that was before boiling tensions exploded into public view as Trump and Vance accused Zelenskyy of being "disrespectful" toward the [United States](https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/us-military)
 and the Trump administration.

"He made it hard for the American people to believe he is a good investment," he added. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., Chris Coons, D-Del., and Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., as well as other Democratic and Republican senators, gathered for an hourlong "encouraging" meeting with Zelenskyy ahead of his visit to the White House, the three lawmakers posted on their social media accounts.

"Just finished an encouraging meeting in Washington with President @ZelenskyyUa and a bipartisan group of Senators to discuss our ongoing partnership with Ukraine," Coons [wrote on X](https://x.com/ChrisCoons/status/1895502158105104419)
, accompanied by a selfie with Zelenskyy, Graham and Klobuchar.

Graham said he urged Zelenskyy ahead of the meeting with Trump not to "take the bait," but he wasn't the only one, sources told ABC News. They noted that Graham was very blunt, telling Zelenskyy to "suck up a bit" and thank the president extensively.

But senators on both sides of the aisle tried to provide Zelenskyy with "friendly coaching," according to two people who were in the room during the bipartisan meeting with the Ukrainian leader.

 TV station has been accused of labeling the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, as Russian territory during an Easter broadcast, prompting Ukraine's Foreign Ministry to call for an investigation "if this was a mistake rather than a deliberate political statement."

Why It Matters
--------------

Moscow has attempted to paint the government in Kyiv as illegitimate, and President [Vladimir Putin](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/vladimir-putin)
 penned an extensive essay back in 2021 that called Russia and Ukraine "one people."

Moscow has labeled territory annexed from Ukraine as Russian, and suggested these areas fall under the country's nuclear umbrella.

The Kremlin seized control of Crimea, the peninsula to the south of mainland Ukraine, from Kyiv in 2014. Languages: English, Spanish.You can reach Ellie via email at [e.cook@newsweek.com](mailto:e.cook@newsweek.com)

Newsweek AI is in beta. Patriarch Kirill, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, has endorsed the invasion of Ukraine.

Putin attended an Easter service at Moscow's Cathedral of Christ the Savior, conducted by Patriarch Kirill, late on Saturday.

The Kremlin leader declared on Saturday that Moscow would halt "all military operations" for 30 hours between 6 p.m. ET) on Saturday and midnight into Monday morning as part of an Easter truce resting on "humanitarian" concerns.

The announcement [was quickly met with skepticism from Kyiv officials](https://www.newsweek.com/vladimir-putin-easter-truce-russia-ukraine-backlash-2061857)
 and Western analysts.

Ukraine said Russian strikes and assaults along the front lines have continued despite the announcement. Moscow in turn accused Kyiv of violating the ceasefire.

"As of Easter morning, we can state that the Russian army is attempting to create the general impression of a ceasefire, while in some areas still continuing isolated attempts to advance and inflict losses on Ukraine," Ukrainian President [Volodymyr Zelensky](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/volodymyr-zelensky)
 said in a statement early on Sunday.

The declared truce came a day after Secretary of State [Marco Rubio](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/marco-rubio)
 said Washington could be evaluating in the next few days whether U.S. Russian state media on Sunday referred to Ukraine's southern Zaporizhzhia region as "Novorossiya."

Kremlin spokesperson, [Dmitry Peskov](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/dmitry-peskov)

On April 20, the American Fox News channel, during a live broadcast of the Easter service of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine (OCU), which took place in Kyiv, labeled the Ukrainian capital as a Russian city.

[Ukraine demands apology from Fox News for labeling Kyiv as Russian](https://euromaidanpress.com/2025/04/22/ukraine-demands-apology-from-fox-news-for-labeling-kyiv-as-russian/)

Ukraine’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has demanded an apology from American TV channel Fox News after it incorrectly labeled Kyiv as a Russian city during its Easter broadcast on 20 April 2025.

This comes amid US President Donald Trump’s pivot toward Russia. The broadcast used footage from Ukraine’s public broadcaster Suspilne Kultura.

After correcting the error, Fox News continued broadcasting approximately 30 minutes of Easter service from Moscow featuring Patriarch Kirill next to the stream from Kyiv. Kirill is the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, who blessed Russian troops for the war in March 2022 and has consistently supported the invasion of Ukraine.

Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi reacted to the incident on X.

> _“If this was a mistake, and not a deliberate political statement, they should apologize and investigate who made the error,_” Tykhyi [wrote](https://x.com/SpoxUkraineMFA/status/1913874411913888136)
> .

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also indirectly referenced the situation in a Telegram post, though without specifically naming the media outlet.

> _“…It is worth not broadcasting services from Moscow, but putting pressure on Moscow to actually implement a complete ceasefire and maintain it for at least 30 days after Easter, to give diplomacy a chance,”_ Zelenskyy [wrote](https://t.me/V_Zelenskiy_official/13922)
> .

Fox News has not yet commented on the error.

Ukraine demands apology from Fox News for labeling Kyiv as Russian
==================================================================

During Orthodox Easter service broadcast on 20 April, Fox News incorrectly labeled Kyiv as a Russian city for 20 minutes before correcting the error.

[! Fox News’ mislabeling of Kyiv as a Russian city echoes Moscow’s anti-Ukrainian propaganda, which has been used to justify Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine.

[According](https://www.bbc.com/ukrainian/articles/cql6kp44g7eo)
 to BBC Ukraine, the error occurred during Fox News’ live transmission of the Easter service from the Orthodox Church of Ukraine, where Kyiv was marked as a Russian city for approximately 20 minutes before the mistake was corrected."

В **Міністерстві закордонних справ України** заявили, що телеканал має попросити вибачення за свою помилку та провести розслідування.

> "Якщо це була помилка, а не свідома політична заява, слід вибачитися та розслідувати, хто зробив помилку", — заявив речник МЗС Георгій Тихий.

Oroszország neve szerepelt Kijevé mellett az amerikai Fox News csatorna adásában, amelyben a különböző országok húsvéti ünnepségeit mutatták be, [írja](https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2025/04/20/7508362/)
 az Ukrajinszka Pravda. Többek között az orosz ortodox egyház ceremóniáját is bemutatták, amelyen Vlagyimir Putyin elnök is részt vett, majd nem sokkal később az ukránoké következett.

„Kijev, Ukrajna” – állt a felirat felvétel mellett, majd Ukrajnát egyszer csak kicserélték Oroszországra, amit aztán hosszabb ideig mutattak a képernyőn. Végül azért visszacsatolták Ukrajna fővárosát Ukrajnához.

Mindez jelentős felháborodást keltett az orosz agresszió áldozatául esett ország nyilvánosságában.

Fox news

Američka televizijska mreža **Fox News**, poznata po svojoj **pro-republikanskoj orijentaciji**, izazvala je val kritika i ogorčenja nakon što je na Uskrs emitirala **višeminutni prijenos pravoslavne mise** iz Rusije, na kojoj su prikazani **Vladimir Putin** i **patrijarh Kiril Gundjajev**. Tijekom više od **30 minuta emitiranja**, voditelji su Kijev nazvali “**ruskim gradom**“, što je izazvalo val negativnih reakcija u **Ukrajini**, ali i u **Sjedinjenim Američkim Državama**.

* * *

### **Kritike: “Legitimiziranje zločinaca” i “pranje imidža”**

Emitiranje mise s Putinom u prvom planu i patrijarhom Kirilom, koji je **otvoreno podržavao rusku agresiju na Ukrajinu**, mnogi su gledatelji i analitičari okarakterizirali kao **“legitimizaciju ubojica”**. Na društvenim mrežama zaredale su optužbe da **Fox News pokušava prikazati Putina kao uzornog kršćanina**, unatoč njegovim **neispunjenim obećanjima o uskrsnom primirju**, dok se u isto vrijeme nastavljaju **ruski napadi na ukrajinske gradove**.

* * *

### **Dvostruka mjerila i politička poruka?**

Komentatori su upozorili na **hipokriziju u pristupu**, budući da je televizijska kuća odlučila prikazivati **vjerski događaj** u režiji autokratskog režima, istovremeno **zanemarujući agresiju**, **civilne žrtve** i **ratna razaranja** koje taj isti režim provodi. Posebno je problematična izjava voditelja koji je **Kijev, [glavni grad](https://www.rijekadanas.com/pesut-na-skupstini-liste-za-rijeku-nas-glavni-grad-je-rijeka/)
 Ukrajine, nazvao ruskim gradom** – što je stav u potpunosti suprotan međunarodnom pravu i stajalištima većine zapadnih zemalja.

* * *

### **Reakcije iz Ukrajine**

Ukrajinski korisnici društvenih mreža, novinari i diplomati izrazili su **ogorčenje zbog emitiranja sadržaja koji potiče rusku propagandu**.

Elon Musk has pledged to “fix” X’s fact-checking tool following the release of polling contradicting United States President Donald Trump’s claim that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is deeply unpopular in his country.

Rowing in behind Trump’s attacks on Zelenskyy on Thursday, Musk claimed that his social media platform’s “community notes” feature was being “gamed” by governments and traditional media.

Musk made the claim while amplifying an anonymous right-wing X account that questioned the credibility of a widely cited Ukrainian polling outfit because of its work with the US Agency for International Development (USAID), which is being effectively dismantled under the billionaire’s cost-cutting drive.

“If Zelensky was actually loved by the people of Ukraine, he would hold an election. X is now relying on it too much, and it is ironic that leadership is now complaining that it isn’t working well.”

Musk’s broadside against Zelenskyy comes as the Ukrainian leader and the Trump administration have been [engaged in a war of words](/news/2025/2/20/us-switches-stance-on-ukraine-war-seeking-500bn-in-payback)
 over Washington’s efforts to reach a deal with Russia to end the war in Ukraine.

On Wednesday, Trump accused Zelenskyy of being a “dictator” after the Ukrainian leader rejected his claims that Kyiv was to blame for the war and raised concerns about being sidelined in Washington’s negotiations with Moscow.

Trump also claimed that Zelenskyy was “very low” in the polls in his country, echoing his earlier claim that the Ukrainian leader had an approval rating of just 4 percent.

In an opinion poll published by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology on Wednesday, 57 percent of Ukrainians said they trusted Zelenskyy, up five points from December.

The Ukrainian leader’s popularity, however, has waned as the war has gone on, dropping from 90 percent in March 2022 to 64 percent in February last year, according to the institute’s polling.

Since taking control of X, formerly known as Twitter, in 2022, Musk has been [heavily criticised](/economy/2023/5/2/twitter-fulfilling-more-government-censorship-requests-under-musk?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
 for allowing, and in some cases promoting, misinformation on the platform.

An analysis published by the nonprofit Center for Countering Digital Hate found that nearly three-quarters of a sample of false or misleading posts about the 2024 US elections did not display accurate notes correcting the record.

“I think there’s a strong chance that X/Twitter becomes a propaganda arm for Musk/Trump – and, in fact, it’s already happening,” Gordon Pennycook, a professor of psychology at Cornell University who studies misinformation, told Al Jazeera.

“I think Musk wants to reform community notes because he doesn’t like being corrected, as is typical for authoritarian oligarchs.”

Musk, one of Trump’s [most powerful allies](/news/2025/2/12/elon-musk-appears-at-white-house-defending-doges-work)
 as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), did not provide evidence of manipulation of X’s community notes system, which attaches explanatory notes to contentious posts based on the consensus of users.

The Tesla CEO, who later on Thursday appeared at the Conservative Political Action Conference waving a chainsaw in homage to Argentina’s cost-cutting president Javier Milei, also did not substantiate a claim that widely reported polling by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology was “Zelensky-controlled” and “not credible.”

Lucas Graves, a journalism professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who researches misinformation and disinformation, described Musk’s comments as “extremely concerning”.

“As is often the case with this kind of rhetoric, the accusations are a guide to what we have to look out for from the accuser – a world where private platforms like X can be systematically gamed to favour the political interests and alliances of their owners,” Graves told Al Jazeera.

“A well-designed community notes system can be a useful check on misinformation. He knows he would lose in a landslide, despite having seized control of ALL Ukrainian media, so he canceled the election,” Musk said on X, while sharing the unsubstantiated claim that US intelligence agencies estimate Zelenskyy’s approval to be just 4 percent.

“In reality, he is despised by the people of Ukraine, which is why he has refused to hold an election,” Musk said, referring to Zelenskyy’s decision to suspend elections after declaring martial law in the wake of Moscow’s 2022 invasion.

“I challenge Zelensky to hold an election and refute this."

[Elon Musk](/topic/elon-musk)
 has accused [Volodymyr Zelensky](/topic/volodymyr-zelensky)
 of “feeding off the dead bodies of Ukrainian soldiers” as the [Trump administration](/news/world/europe/ukraine-russia-war-talks-trump-putin-saudi-arabia-b2699476.html)
 continues ferociously lashing out at the Ukrainian president.

The Tesla owner wrote on his X site, without evidence, that Zelensky is “despised by the people of Ukraine” in a post that refuted Kyiv’s claims that the president has a 57 per cent approval rating. Trump later said Zelensky was a “dictator” who had “better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left”.

Musk’s post also vowed to “fix” X’s Community Notes feature, after accusing “governments and legacy media” of gaming the crowd-sourced fact-checking feature.

His comments came in response to a post from an anonymous X account, taking issue with the fact that the polling quoted by Mr Zelensky had been published by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology.

The post claimed that “U.S. Avoid hateful, derogatory, or inflammatory language.”

As _The Independent_ has [reported](/tech/elon-musk-wikipedia-nazi-salute-free-speech-b2685552.html)
, in practice, Musk’s commitment to free speech and fact-based discussion only goes so far.

The billionaire has called for a boycott of Wikipedia in protest at a change to his page regarding his alleged Nazi salute at the Trump inauguration, and he frequently traffics in inaccurate, unsourced, or fully untrue claims on his own X account. “If you start tampering with the system because you personally dislike some notes, then how could users continue to trust it?”

_The Independent_ has contacted X for comment.

Musk, who has long framed himself as a champion of online free speech, has touted Community Notes as an effective tool to maintain factual discourse on X without resorting to top-down speech guidelines.

“Community Notes aims to help all people better understand issues discussed in posts, including people who may hold different viewpoints,” the company’s website reads. Agency for International Development (USAID), the foreign aid agency that Musk has repeatedly claimed without evidence is a “criminal organization.”

On Thursday Musk took to the stage with Argentinian president Javier Milei at the Conservative Political Action Conference, where he held up a chainsaw - replicating a previous stunt by Milei to represent the cuts he planned to government spending.

Trump and Musk have been accused of playing into [Russia](/topic/russia)
’s heavily distorted narrative of its invasion of the country. unfortunately lives in this disinformation space.”

Experts, including those at the sociology institute, have found that Zelensky has greater than majority support, with a recent survey finding that 57 percent of Ukrainians trusted the president.

Keith Darden, an American University professor who studies Ukraine, [told](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/19/politics/fact-check-trump-falsely-claims-zelensky-has-a-4-approval-rating-its-above-50/index.html)
 CNN the private institute is considered “the best and most reliable survey organization in Ukraine,” and its findings are quoted in U.S. “Spreading misinformation about his legitimacy directly aids Kremlin propaganda and undermines the Ukrainian people’s right to determine their own future.”

Zelensky said on Wednesday that claims he’s a dictator are “coming from Russia.”

“If anyone wants to replace me right now, then it just isn’t going to happen,” he [said](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/02/19/ukraine-russia-trump-elections-zelensky/)
 at a news conference. Because none of this is having a positive effect on Ukraine.”

Indeed, Russian leaders have praised the White House, with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov saying that Trump “[understands our position](/news/world/americas/trump-russia-zelensky-ukraine-war-blame-b2701773.html)
.”

“A Dictator without Elections, Zelenskyy better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left.’ If you'd told me just three months ago that these were the words of the US president, I would have laughed out loud,” former Russian president [](https://x.com/MedvedevRussiaE)
[Dmitry Medvedev](https://x.com/MedvedevRussiaE)
 [wrote](https://x.com/MedvedevRussiaE/status/1892289659603910745)
 on X. Bankrupt clown…”

Ukrainian and international leaders expressed their support for Zelensky after the claims from Trump and Musk, and argued the White House is playing into Putin’s hands.

“We may like Zelensky, or we may not. And no lying creature, neither in Moscow, nor in Washington, nor anywhere, has the right to open his mouth against him.”

Former Lithuanian foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis [told](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/02/19/ukraine-russia-trump-elections-zelensky/)
 _The Washington Post_ the White House’s stance sounds like a “handout” prepared by Lavrov.

Following Trump’s comments, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer [affirmed](https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-legitimacy-question/)
 his position that Zelensky is the country’s "democratically elected leader,” and argued it is "perfectly reasonable to suspend elections during wartime as the U.K."

**HAMILTON, Canada**

Billionaire Elon Musk, a senior advisor to US President Donald Trump, accused Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of killing an American journalist.

"Zelensky killed an American journalist!" Musk said Wednesday on his X account after Trump called the Ukrainian leader a "dictator without elections" and warned that he "better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left."

Musk's post came after an account claimed that Chilean-American journalist Gonzalo Lira was killed in Ukraine last year for allegedly being critical of Zelenskyy.

Trump posted on his Truth Social platform hours after Zelenskyy hit back at his suggestion that Kyiv "should have never started" the war, saying the US president was living in a Russian "disinformation bubble."

Trump has advanced negotiations to end the three-year-long war in Ukraine, without the participation of Kyiv and other European governments.

He said Europe has failed to bring peace to Ukraine and the US was successfully negotiating an end to the war. **Please contact us for subscription options.**](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/p/subscription/1001)

 While the latter, like "Newsfeed", only displays activity from accounts followed by the user, "For You" displays an algorithmically curated feed similar to that of [TikTok](/wiki/TikTok "TikTok")

### Promotion of Elon Musk's tweets

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Twitter_under_Elon_Musk&action=edit&section=29 "Edit section: Promotion of Elon Musk's tweets")\

On February 7, 2023, Elon Musk convened a meeting of Twitter engineers and advisors to address the decline in engagement with his own tweets.[\[338\]](#cite_note-newton-9feb23-338)
 One of the company's two principal engineers, after suggesting that public interest in Musk was waning following a peak during [his acquisition of the platform](/wiki/Acquisition_of_Twitter_by_Elon_Musk "Acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk")
, was fired.[\[338\]](#cite_note-newton-9feb23-338)
 A [Google Trends](/wiki/Google_Trends "Google Trends")
 chart presented by employees had shown a decline in popularity.[\[338\]](#cite_note-newton-9feb23-338)
 The following week, after the [Super Bowl LVII](/wiki/Super_Bowl_LVII "Super Bowl LVII")
, Twitter employee James Musk, who is Elon's paternal cousin, sent a message to the company's engineers concerning a "high urgency" matter: that Elon Musk's tweet about the Super Bowl had received less impressions than one sent by US president [Joe Biden](/wiki/Joe_Biden "Joe Biden")
.[\[339\]](#cite_note-newton-15feb23-339)
 By that afternoon, Twitter's algorithm had been altered to artificially boost Musk's tweets by a factor of 1,000.[\[339\]](#cite_note-newton-15feb23-339)
 Many users observed an overwhelming promotion of his posts in the "For You" tab.[\[339\]](#cite_note-newton-15feb23-339)
 Following criticism, the boost was lessened to a smaller factor.[\[339\]](#cite_note-newton-15feb23-339)

### Promotion of state-controlled media

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Twitter_under_Elon_Musk&action=edit&section=30 "Edit section: Promotion of state-controlled media")\
\]

On April 6, 2023, Twitter reversed its official policy stating that the platform would not "recommend or amplify" the content of state-controlled media entities.[\[173\]](#cite_note-kann-173)
 According to an analysis by the [Digital Forensic Research Lab](/wiki/Digital_Forensic_Research_Lab "Digital Forensic Research Lab")
, the change had already taken effect since around March 29, when Twitter stopped filtering government accounts in [Russia](/wiki/Russia "Russia")
, [China](/wiki/China "China")
 and [Iran](/wiki/Iran "Iran")
.[\[173\]](#cite_note-kann-173)
 These accounts, such as those managed by Russia's [RT](/wiki/RT_(TV_network) "RT (TV network)")
, have a significant presence on the platform.[\[173\]](#cite_note-kann-173)
 Following the change, which enabled the accounts to be algorithmically promoted by Twitter, their follower count quickly rose.[\[173\]](#cite_note-kann-173)

### Promotion of conservative content

 supporters.[\[340\]](#cite_note-davis-340)
[\[341\]](#cite_note-computational-analysis-341)
 The study, which looked at more than 56,000 posts, identified a system-wide "structural break" on the platform around July 13, 2024, a date which coincides with Elon Musk's endorsement of [Donald Trump](/wiki/Donald_Trump "Donald Trump")
 in the [2024 US presidential election](/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election "2024 United States presidential election")
.[\[341\]](#cite_note-computational-analysis-341)
 From that point on, Elon Musk and other Republican commentators saw increased visibility for their tweets.[\[341\]](#cite_note-computational-analysis-341)
 According to the researchers behind the study, this "could imply an algorithmic adjustment".[\[341\]](#cite_note-computational-analysis-341)
 On January 17, 2025, the [European Commission](/wiki/European_Commission "European Commission")
 requested to see Twitter's internal documentation about its algorithms "and any recent changes made to it", following accusations of manipulation benefitting [far-right](/wiki/Far-right_politics "Far-right politics")
 viewpoints.[\[342\]](#cite_note-guardian-dsa-jan17-342)

On November 16, 2022, Musk stated that he planned to eventually appoint a new CEO to oversee Twitter,[\[105\]](#cite_note-105)
 shortly thereafter beginning the process of searching for his successor.[\[106\]](#cite_note-106)
 On December 18, amid growing public discontent surrounding the [ElonJet](/wiki/ElonJet "ElonJet")
 and [Mastodon](/wiki/Mastodon_(social_network) "Mastodon (social network)")
 controversies, Musk conducted an [open-access](/wiki/Open-access_poll "Open-access poll")
 Twitter poll asking whether he should resign from his position as Twitter CEO, claiming that he would "abide by the results".[\[107\]](#cite_note-107)
[\[108\]](#cite_note-108)
 The poll resolved to "yes" after 57.5 percent of 17.5 million users voted in favor of him stepping down.[\[109\]](#cite_note-109)
[\[110\]](#cite_note-110)

After this result, Musk responded "interesting" to unfounded theories that the result of the resignation poll had been influenced by bots, agreeing with a user's suggestion to restrict future polls on policy changes to paid Twitter Blue subscribers.[\[111\]](#cite_note-111)
[\[112\]](#cite_note-112)
[\[113\]](#cite_note-113)
 On December 20, he announced he would step down as CEO as soon as his replacement was selected, but would continue to lead Twitter's software and server teams.[\[114\]](#cite_note-114)
 On April 11, 2023, he told the BBC that he had stepped down and appointed his dog as CEO.[\[115\]](#cite_note-115)

On May 11, 2023, Musk announced he had found a person to succeed him in the CEO position;[\[116\]](#cite_note-GuardianCEO-116)
 the following day, he named [Linda Yaccarino](/wiki/Linda_Yaccarino "Linda Yaccarino")

### Corporate value

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Twitter_under_Elon_Musk&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Corporate value")\
\]

One year after the Musk acquisition, company documents related to employee [restricted stock](/wiki/Restricted_stock "Restricted stock")
 grants showed the company had estimated its own valuation at about $19 billion, down about 55% from Musk's purchase price.[\[118\]](#cite_note-118)
[\[119\]](#cite_note-119)
 A lower estimate was reported in October 2023 from [Fidelity](/wiki/Fidelity_Investments "Fidelity Investments")
 at about the same time, estimating the company to be down 65% from its purchase price.[\[120\]](#cite_note-120)
 Fidelity estimated in October 2024 that the company's value was down 79% from Musk's original purchase price, 24% lower than what Fidelity had estimated two months earlier.[\[121\]](#cite_note-121)
 In February 2025, Musk was reportedly in talks for a new round of financing at a $44 billion valuation, thus returning to the valuation at the time of purchase.[\[122\]](#cite_note-122)

### Fines

On October 28, 2022, Musk announced that a "content moderation council" with diversified viewpoints would be established to inform the platform's "content policy", and declared a moratorium in "major content decisions or account reinstatements" until then.[\[161\]](#cite_note-161)
 The council was never formed; Musk claimed that it had been part of a deal made with activists who had failed to honor it.[\[162\]](#cite_note-162)
 He also signaled an intention to do away with lifetime account [suspensions](/wiki/Twitter_suspensions "Twitter suspensions")
 and unban those suspended for "minor \[or\] dubious reasons".[\[163\]](#cite_note-163)
[\[164\]](#cite_note-164)
[\[165\]](#cite_note-165)
 Musk later stated that he would not alter Twitter's content policies or restore banned accounts until after the [midterm elections](/wiki/2022_United_States_midterm_elections "2022 United States midterm elections")
.[\[166\]](#cite_note-166)
[\[167\]](#cite_note-167)

In June 2023, Musk defended the approach to content moderation as "[freedom of speech](/wiki/Freedom_of_speech "Freedom of speech")
, not freedom of reach", but went against his own policies, restricting the use of the terms "cis" and "cisgender" arguing that they are slurs,[\[168\]](#cite_note-Piemontese-20232-168)
 and describing the platform as having [liberal bias](/wiki/Liberal_bias "Liberal bias")
.[\[169\]](#cite_note-169)

### Child sexual abuse material

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Twitter_under_Elon_Musk&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Child sexual abuse material")\
\]

In August 2023, it was reported that [child sexual abuse material](/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse_material "Child sexual abuse material")
 (CSAM) on Twitter was still an issue, despite statements by Musk that removing it was a top priority.[\[214\]](#cite_note-NYT_CP-214)
[\[215\]](#cite_note-Vice_CP-215)
 As of June 2023, an investigation by the [Stanford Internet Observatory](/wiki/Stanford_Internet_Observatory "Stanford Internet Observatory")

 reported "a lapse in basic enforcement" against CSAM by Twitter within "recent months".[\[216\]](#cite_note-216)
[\[217\]](#cite_note-217)
 The number of staff on Twitter's trust and safety teams were reduced, for example, leaving one full-time staffer to handle all child sexual abuse material in the [Asia-Pacific](/wiki/Asia-Pacific "Asia-Pacific")
 region in November 2022.[\[218\]](#cite_note-218)

According to the _[Australian Financial Review](/wiki/Australian_Financial_Review "Australian Financial Review")
_, the Australian government's eSafety Commission reported in March 2023 that, since Musk's acquisition of the platform, "the proactive detection of child sexual exploitation material \[on Twitter\] fell from 90 per cent to 75 per cent."[\[221\]](#cite_note-:3-221)
 In 2024, the company unsuccessfully attempted to avoid the imposition of fines in Australia regarding the government's inquiries about child safety enforcement; X Corp reportedly said they had no obligation to respond to the inquiries since they were addressed to "Twitter Inc", which X Corp argued had "ceased to exist".[\[221\]](#cite_note-:3-221)
[\[222\]](#cite_note-222)

Elon Musk was criticized in July 2023 for intervening to unban political influencer "Dom Lucre".[\[223\]](#cite_note-:2-223)
[\[219\]](#cite_note-WP_CP-219)
 Lucre had, according to _[Forbes](/wiki/Forbes "Forbes")

Al Jazeera published an article on February 21, 2025, discussing Elon Musk's criticism of Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his claims about the Ukrainian leader's popularity. The article mentions Musk's comments on X, but it does not mention any plans to suspend Zelenskyy's account. ([https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/2/21/musk-vows-to-fix-x-after-polls-show-high-support-for-ukraines-zelenskyy](https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/2/21/musk-vows-to-fix-x-after-polls-show-high-support-for-ukraines-zelenskyy)) <image:1>

The Independent published an article discussing Elon Musk's accusations against Volodymyr Zelenskyy, including a claim that Zelenskyy is "despised by the people of Ukraine."

## Elaboration

Based on the available evidence, the claim cannot be verified. The search results do not provide any information about Musk planning to suspend Zelenskyy's account.

To verify the claim, information about Musk's specific posts regarding the suspension of Zelenskyy's account is needed.

_Newsweek_ has contacted the Kremlin for comment.

Newsweek AI is in beta. The cause of the fire is not known, and it is not clear whether the vehicle had been personally used by Putin, but the Russian leader has reportedly displayed paranoia about assassination plots.

What To Know
------------

The Aurus limousine blew up on Sretenka Street just north of the FSB headquarters in Lubyanka on Saturday night, with video footage showing the fire spreading to the vehicle's interior.

Onlookers can be seen watching back smoke billowing out of the front of the destroyed vehicle, and the rear of the car also seemed to be damaged.

It is not clear who was using the car, but it is said to be owned by Putin's Presidential Property Management Department, British newspaper _The Sun_ reported. The independent Russian language outlet Meduza [said that Putin](https://www.newsweek.com/putin-decries-massive-blunder-after-top-general-assassinated-2003548)
 had called the incident a major security lapse.

Video from Putin's visit last week to the Arctic city of Murmansk showed servicemen from a ceremonial guard being patted down for hidden weapons or explosive devices before the president came to lay a wreath by the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.

What People Are Saying
----------------------

**_The Sun_ newspaper wrote:** "An Aurus limousine from Putin's 'official car fleet' blew up in a huge blast on a street just north of Moscow's FSB secret service headquarters in Lubyanka."

**Ukrainian X user Devana posted:** "Not just Russia is burning—even Putin's limo went boom. So hey, Vladimir—if even your car goes up in flames next to FSB HQ … maybe the system's cracking from within?"

What Happens Next
-----------------

Official comment about the car blast is unlikely, but security around Putin will continue to dominate headlines. [Russia's special services have ramped up](https://www.newsweek.com/putin-spending-personal-security-russia-ukraine-arrest-warrant-icc-1803885)
 the [already-strict security measures](https://www.newsweek.com/putin-bulletproof-vest-armor-public-events-security-1908361)
 surrounding the Russian leader to an unprecedented degree, unnamed Russian and Kremlin officials told _The Moscow Times_ in June 2024.

In a dramatic scene near Moscow's FSB headquarters on Lubyanka Street, one of Russian President Vladimir Putin's luxury limousines exploded and caught fire, reports the Serbian news outlet [Kurir](https://www.kurir.rs/planeta/9627201/eksplodirala-putinova-limuzina-aurus-senat-u-moskvi)
.

The blaze, which started in the engine of the €330,000 special-purpose "Aurus Senat" vehicle, rapidly advanced into the interior. Fortunately, no casualties were recorded, although initial reports suggested someone might have been inside at the time.

Known for his preference for domestically produced vehicles, President Putin recently gifted a similar limousine to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. Officers painstakingly searched all manhole covers and trash bins near a location where Putin intended to speak in Moscow.

On February 3 explosion rocked a luxury apartment complex, "Scarlet Sails," in Moscow. The blast caused Sarkisyan's leg amputation, and according to [Russian media](https://ura.news/news/1052883866)
, he succumbed shortly in intensive care without regaining consciousness, with shrapnel wounds near the heart cited as the preliminary cause of death.

Comments
--------

* * * Additional footage from a different angle shows damage to the vehicle's rear section as well.

According to reports, the limousine is managed by the Russian President's asset management department. The incident coincides with heightened "paranoia over potential assassination attempts" surrounding the Russian leader.

A troubling recent incident during Putin's visit to Murmansk highlights these security concerns. A video surfaced showing a ceremonial Russian guard undergoing a humiliating process: each soldier was thoroughly searched by an officer from the Federal Protective Service for concealed weapons or explosives before Putin laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Reportedly, the honor guard was issued rifles with no ammunition due to fears of an assassination, possibly even from within Putin's own security.

Security around Putin continues to dominate headlines, as evidenced by another recent case reflecting the Kremlin's "profound concern" for Putin's safety. He was known as Arman Gorlovsky and faced international warrant for assassination-related charges.

As [Kommersant](https://t.me/kommersant/78064)
 explains, the bomb detonated as Sarkisyan and his guards entered the building, resulting in a guard's death and injuries to others."

The Russians treated the Japanese with the utmost cruelty after their deadly attack on Japan's Kwantung Army in Manchuria just days before Japan's surrender.[\[38\]](#cite_note-46)

 of the [Imperial Japanese Army](/wiki/Imperial_Japanese_Army "Imperial Japanese Army")
, under General [Otozo Yamada](/wiki/Otozo_Yamada "Otozo Yamada")
, was the major part of the Japanese occupation forces in Manchuria and Korea, and consisted of two Area Armies and three independent armies:[\[1\]](#cite_note-Glantz-1)

*   [First Area Army](/wiki/Japanese_First_Area_Army "Japanese First Area Army")
     (northeastern Manchukuo), including:
    *   [3rd Army](/wiki/Japanese_Third_Army "Japanese Third Army")
        
    *   [5th Army](/wiki/Japanese_Fifth_Army "Japanese Fifth Army")

    *   [44th Army](/wiki/Japanese_Forty-Fourth_Army "Japanese Forty-Fourth Army")
        
*   Independent units:
    *   [4th Army](/wiki/Japanese_Fourth_Army "Japanese Fourth Army")
         (an independent field army responsible for northern Manchuria)
    *   [34th Army](/wiki/Japanese_Thirty-Fourth_Army "Japanese Thirty-Fourth Army")

    *   [Seventeenth Area Army](/wiki/Japanese_Seventeenth_Area_Army "Japanese Seventeenth Area Army")
         (responsible for Korea; assigned to the Kwantung Army at the eleventh hour, to no avail)

Each _Area Army_ (_Homen Gun_, the equivalent of a [Western](/wiki/Western_world "Western world")
 "army") had headquarters units and units attached directly to the Area Army, in addition to the field armies (the equivalent of a Western corps). Soviet paratroopers destroyed the Kwantung Army from behind its own lines, while Japanese anti-tank shells bounced off the sides of Soviet tanks.[\[39\]](#cite_note-47)
 The Japanese forces in Manchuria retreated in fear.[\[40\]](#cite_note-48)

Japanese troops and able-bodied Japanese men in Manchuria were taken prisoner by the Russians and transported to labor camps in Siberia, where many Japanese men would die.[\[41\]](#cite_note-49)
 From the Russians' perspective, this was seen as revenge for Russia's defeat in the [Russo-Japanese War](/wiki/Russo-Japanese_War "Russo-Japanese War")
 of 1905.[\[42\]](#cite_note-50)
 The stories of how poorly the Soviets treated the Japanese were brought to [Beijing](/wiki/Beijing "Beijing")
 by Japanese evacuees of Manchuria, creating panic among the Japanese population; however, the Russians honored their agreement with Chiang Kai-shek by not entering China proper.[\[43\]](#cite_note-51)

Japanese communication infrastructure was poor, and the Japanese lost communication with forward units very early on."

The Russian military has identified 160 priority targets in [Japan](https://www.scmp.com/topics/japan?module=inline&pgtype=article)
 and [South Korea](https://www.scmp.com/topics/south-korea?module=inline&pgtype=article)
 in the event of a conflict with [Nato](https://www.scmp.com/topics/nato?module=inline&pgtype=article)
 expanding into East Asia, according to secret documents obtained by the Financial Times.

While many targets include legitimate military sites like airfields, radar installations and naval installations, the list also features civilian infrastructure such as nuclear power plants, factories, and transport tunnels.

Deliberately attacking such civilian sites, in the same way Russian forces have done in [Ukraine](https://www.scmp.com/topics/ukraine?module=inline&pgtype=article)
, would constitute a war crime, one analyst said.

In a story published on Tuesday, the British paper reported on 29 leaked Russian military documents used for training officers for potential conflicts in northeastern Asia, shared by “Western sources.”

Although the documents are dated from 2008 to 2014, James Brown, an international relations professor at Temple University in Tokyo, who specialises in Russian affairs, told This Week in Asia that the core elements of Russian strategy and targeting data are likely to remain relevant, albeit updated and enhanced with more recent information.

> It’s obvious why radar facilities and airbases would be targets, but nuclear power plants? Road and rail tunnels?

James Brown, analyst

“Of course, the Russians will have plans for targets in the event of a war breaking out because they need to know what they have to hit,” Brown said.

Russian and Chinese naval vessels plan to conduct a joint patrol in the Asia Pacific region, following recent [exercises in the Sea of Japan](/news/2025/8/3/china-and-russia-begin-joint-military-drills-in-sea-of-japan)
, Russia’s official Interfax has reported.

Citing a statement on Wednesday from the Russian Pacific Fleet’s press service, Interfax said that ships from the Russian Navy and China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Navy “will form a new task group to carry out joint patrol missions in the Asia-Pacific region”.

“After replenishing supplies from logistics vessels, the crews of the Russian Navy and the PLA Navy will form a new detachment to carry out joint patrol tasks in the Asia-Pacific region,” the news agency said.

Russia is conducting a series of military exercises with China in response to the build-up of US military potential in the Asia Pacific region, Interfax said, citing Russia’s chief of staff, Valery Gerasimov, in 2022.

Moscow and Beijing have already conducted joint air patrols in the Asia Pacific region since 2019, it added.

The joint patrol announcement comes as the two countries conclude five days of joint naval drills in the Sea of Japan that focused on anti-submarine and air defence missions.

During the final phase of the exercises, Russia’s large anti-submarine ship Admiral Tributs and the corvette Gromky, together with the Chinese destroyers Shaoxing and Urumqi, carried out live-fire drills while crews practised searching for and neutralising a mock enemy submarine, Interfax reported.

Russia’s Pacific Fleet earlier said that the drills were defensive in nature and not directed against any other countries.

The reported formation of the Asia Pacific joint patrol comes as China modernises and upgrades its naval fleet to become a “blue water” force, capable of carrying out long-range operations in the world’s oceans, similar to the United States and other Western forces.

[Russia and China](/news/2024/9/10/china-russia-to-conduct-joint-naval-and-air-drills-this-month)
, which signed a “no-limits” strategic partnership shortly before Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, conduct regular exercises to rehearse coordination between their armed forces and send a deterrent signal to adversaries.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence does not support the claim that China and Japan plan to invade the Russian Federation. The provided sources mention a Soviet invasion of Manchuria, leaked Russian plans to target sites in Japan and South Korea, and joint naval patrols between Russia and China in the Asia Pacific region. None of these sources mention any invasion plans by China or Japan against Russia.

The evidence suggests that Russia and China are cooperating militarily, but this does not imply an invasion plan. The image shows a ship in Japan.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

The claim is unsupported by the evidence. While there is evidence of historical conflicts, such as the Soviet invasion of Manchuria ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_invasion_of_Manchuria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_invasion_of_Manchuria)), and current military cooperation between Russia and China, there is no evidence to suggest that China and Japan are planning to invade Russia.

Given names
-----------

East Slavic parents select a [given name](/wiki/Russian_personal_name "Russian personal name")
 for a newborn child. Most first names in East Slavic languages originate from two sources:

*   [Eastern Orthodox Church](/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church "Eastern Orthodox Church")
     tradition
*   [native pre-Christian Slavic lexicons](/wiki/Slavic_names "Slavic names")
    

Almost all first names are single. Doubled first names (as in, for example, [French](/wiki/French_name "French name")
, like _Jean-Luc_) are very rare and are from foreign influence. Most doubled first names are written with a hyphen: _Mariya-Tereza_.

### Forms

Being highly [synthetic languages](/wiki/Synthetic_languages "Synthetic languages")
, the East Slavic ones treat personal names as [grammatical](/wiki/Grammatical "Grammatical")
 nouns and apply the same rules of [inflection](/wiki/Inflection "Inflection")
 and [derivation](/wiki/Derivation_(linguistics) "Derivation (linguistics)")
 to them as for other nouns. So one can create many forms with different degrees of affection and familiarity by adding the corresponding suffixes to the auxiliary stem derived from the original name. The auxiliary stem may be identical to the word stem of the full name (the full name Жанна _Zhanna_ can have the suffixes added directly to the stem Жанн- _Zhann-_ like Жанн**очка** _Zhann**ochka**_), and most names have the auxiliary stem derived unproductively (the Russian name Михаил _Mikhail_ has the auxiliary stem Миш- _Mish-_, which produces such name-forms as Миш**а** _Mish**a**_, Миш**енька** _Mish**enka**_, Миш**уня** _Mish**unya**_ etc., not \***Михаил**ушка _**Mikhail**ushka_).

Unlike English, in which the use of diminutive forms is optional even between close friends, in East Slavonic languages, such forms are obligatory in certain contexts because of the strong [T–V distinction](/wiki/T%E2%80%93V_distinction "T–V distinction")
: the T-form of address usually requires the short form of the counterpart's name. Also, unlike other languages with prominent use of name suffixes, such as Japanese, the use of derived name forms is mostly limited to the T-addressing: there is no way to make the name more formal than the plain unsuffixed full form, and usually no suffixes can be added to the family name.

Most commonly, Russian philologists distinguish the following forms of given names:

| Name form | Example | Formation | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Full | _Анна_ (Anna) | full name stem + case ending | \-  |
| Short | _Ан**я**_ (An**ya**) | short name stem + II declension ending | most common for informal communication, comparable to Western name-only form of address _(Ann, John)_, or Japanese surname-only, or _surname/name -kun_ |
| Diminutive | _Ань**к**а_ (An**k**a) | short name stem + -к- _\-k-_ + II declension ending | expresses familiarity, may be considered rude when used between people who are not close friends. Comparable to English diminutives _(Annie, Willy)_ or Japanese unsuffixed names |
| Affective diminutive | _Ан**ечк**а_ (An**yechk**a) | short name stem + -ечк/очк/оньк/усь/юсь/уль/юль- _\-echk/ochk/on'k/us/yus/ul/yul-_ + II declension ending | most intimate and affectionate form, comparable to German diminutives _(Ännchen)_ or Japanese _\-chan_ suffixes |

#### Short forms

[Marina Tsvetaeva](/wiki/Marina_Tsvetaeva "Marina Tsvetaeva")
, a Russian poet. The name "Marina" traditionally has no short form.

_Руслан_ (Ruslan), a character in [Alexander Pushkin](/wiki/Alexander_Pushkin "Alexander Pushkin")
's poem _[Ruslan and Ludmila](/wiki/Ruslan_and_Ludmila "Ruslan and Ludmila")
_. The short form for _Руслан_ (Ruslan) is _Руся_ (Rusya).

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Mikola_II.jpg/250px-Mikola_II.jpg)](/wiki/File:Mikola_II.jpg)

Николай II ([Nicholas II](/wiki/Nicholas_II "Nicholas II")
), the last Russian emperor. In private, [his wife](/wiki/Alexandra_Feodorovna_(Alix_of_Hesse) "Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)")
 addressed him as Nicki, in the German manner, rather than _Коля_ (Kolya), which is the East Slavic short form of his name.

The "short name" (Russian: краткое имя _kratkoye imya_), historically also "half-name" (Russian: полуимя _poluimya_), is the simplest and most common name derivative. Bearing no suffix, it is produced [suppletively](/wiki/Suppletion "Suppletion")
 and always has the declension noun ending for both males and females, thus making short forms of certain unisex names indistinguishable: for example, Sasha (Russian: Саша) is the short name for both the masculine name Aleksandr (Alexander) and the feminine form Aleksandra (Alexandra).

Some names, such as Zhanna (Jeana) and Mark, have no short forms; others may have two (or more) different forms. In the latter case, one form is usually more informal than the other.

#### Diminutive forms

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Veruschka_Gr%C3%A4fin_von_Lehndorff_001.jpg/250px-Veruschka_Gr%C3%A4fin_von_Lehndorff_001.jpg)](/wiki/File:Veruschka_Gr%C3%A4fin_von_Lehndorff_001.jpg)

[Veruschka](/wiki/Veruschka "Veruschka")
, a German model, actress and artist. "Veruschka" is the German spelling the [hypocoristic](/wiki/Hypocoristic "Hypocoristic")
 Верушка of her given name [Vera](/wiki/Vera_(given_name) "Vera (given name)")
.

Diminutive forms are produced from the "short name" by means of various suffixes; for example, Михаил Mikhail (full) – Миша Misha (short) – Мишенька Mishenka (affectionate) – Мишка Mishka (colloquial). If no "short name" exists, then diminutive forms are produced from the full form of the respective first name; for example, Марина Marina (full) – Мариночка Marinochka (affectionate) – Маринка Marinka (colloquial). Unlike the full name, a diminutive name carries a particular emotional attitude and may be unacceptable in certain contexts. Depending on the nature of the attitude, diminutive name forms can be subdivided into three broad groups: affectionate, familiar, and slang.

##### Affectionate diminutive

Typically formed by suffixes -_еньк_\- (-yenk-), -_оньк_\- (-onk-), -_ечк_\- (-yechk-), -_ушк_ (-ushk), as illustrated by the examples below. It generally emphasises a tender, affectionate attitude and is roughly analogous to German suffixes -_chen_, -_lein_, Japanese -_chan_ and -_tan_ and affectionate name-derived nicknames in other languages. It is often used to address children or intimate friends.

Within a more official context, this form may be combined with the honorific plural to address a younger female colleague.\[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")\

| Full form | Short form | Diminutive form |
| --- | --- | --- |
| (Cyrillic/Latin) |     |     |

| Ольга/Olga | Оля/Olya | Оленька/Olyenka |
| Степан/Stepan | Стёпа/Styopa | Стёпочка/Styopochka |

##### Colloquial diminutives

Colloquial diminutives are derived from short names by the -_к_\- ("-k-") suffix. Expressing a highly familiar attitude, the use may be considered rude or even pejorative outside a friendly context.

, a subculture similar to British [chavs](/wiki/Chav "Chav")
.

Slang forms exist for male names and, since a few decades ago, female names. They are formed with the suffixes -_ян_ (-yan), -_он_ (-on), and -_ок/ёк_ (-ok/yok). The suffixes give the sense of "male brotherhood" that was once expressed by the patronymic-only form of address in the Soviet Union.

Patronymics
-----------

The patronymic name is based on the given name of the father and is written in all legal and identity documents. If used with the given name, the patronymic always follows it; but it is not analogous to an English [middle name](/wiki/Middle_name "Middle name")
.

### Usage

The patronymic name is obligatory when addressing a person of higher social stance and/or on special occasions such as business meetings; for example, when a pupil addresses a teacher, they are obliged to use both first and patronymic names – [Russian](/wiki/Russian_language "Russian language")
: Марья Ивановна, могу я спросить..., [lit.](/wiki/Literal_translation "Literal translation") 'Marya Ivanovna, may I ask...'. Not using patronymic names in such situations is considered offensive.[\[2\]](#cite_note-3)

Addressing a person by patronymic name only is widespread among older generations and serves as a display of close relationship based on not only sympathy but also mutual responsibility.[\[3\]](#cite_note-4)

In speech patronymics are commonly truncated and it is not considered to be a colloquialism, e.g., written "Ivan Ivanovich" may be pronounced "as is", as well as "Ivan Ivanych".[\[4\]](#cite_note-5)
[\[5\]](#cite_note-6)

In the past of [East Slavs](/wiki/East_Slavs "East Slavs")
, before the introduction of surnames, noble, wealthy, or otherwise respected people were addressed by name plus patronymic, see, e.g., "[Yaroslavich](/wiki/Yaroslavich "Yaroslavich")
"/"[Yaroslavna](/wiki/Yaroslavna "Yaroslavna")
". From this custom a number of surnames of [West Ruthenian](/wiki/Ruthenians "Ruthenians")
 origin was produced, such as [Antonovich](/wiki/Antonovich "Antonovich")
 or [Prokopovich](/wiki/Prokopovich "Prokopovich")
, which in their turn derived [Polish surnames](/wiki/Polish_surnames "Polish surnames")
, such as [Antonowicz](/wiki/Antonowicz "Antonowicz")
 or [Prokopowicz](/wiki/Prokopowicz "Prokopowicz")
 (the Ruthenian origin is recognized by the suffix _\-wicz_: the corresponding native (now archaic) Polish suffix was '-wic': [Szymonowic](/wiki/Szymonowic "Szymonowic")
, [Klonowic](/wiki/Klonowic "Klonowic")
).[\[6\]](#cite_note-7)

For commoners, when the distinction among people with the same given name was required, a qualifier "son of..." was usually added: "Ивашка, Антонов сын" ("Ivashka, Antonov syn", i.e., 'Ivashka, son of Anton'). From the latter tradition Russian [patronymic surnames](/wiki/Patronymic_surname "Patronymic surname")
 ending in "-ov/-ev/yov" originated, in this case, [Antonov](/wiki/Antonov_(surname) "Antonov (surname)")
".

### Derivation

| Name | Masculine patronym | Feminine patronym |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Anatoly | Anatolyevich | Anatolyevna |
| Constantin | Constantinovich | Constantinovna |
| Dmitry | Dmitriyevich | Dmitriyevna |
| Ilya | Ilyich | Ilyinichna |
| Ivan | Ivanovich | Ivanovna |
| Nikolay | Nikolayevich | Nikolayevna |
| Vladimir | Vladimirovich | Vladimirovna |
| Yakov | Yakovlevich | Yakovlevna |

The patronymic is formed by a combination of the father's name and suffixes. The suffix is -_ович_ (-ovich) for a son, -_овна_ (-ovna) – for a daughter. For example, if the father's name was _Иван_ (Ivan), the patronymic will be _Иванович_ (Ivanovich) for a son and _Ивановна_ (Ivanovna) for a daughter.

If the suffix is being appended to a name ending in a _й_ ("y") or a soft [consonant](/wiki/Consonant "Consonant")
, the initial _o_ in the suffixes -_ович_ (-ovich) and -_овна_ (-ovna) becomes a _е_ ("ye") and the suffixes change to -_евич_ (-yevich) and -_евна_ (-yevna). For example, if the father is _Дмитрий_ (Dmitry), the patronymic is _Дмитриевич_ (Dmitrievich) for a son and _Дмитриевна_ (Dmitrievna) for a daughter. It is not _Дмитрович_ (Dmitrovich) or _Дмитровна_ (Dmitrovna) because the name _Дмитрий_ (Dmitry) ends on "й" ("y");

For some names ending in a [vowel](/wiki/Vowel "Vowel")
, the suffix is -_ич_ (-ich) for a son and -_ична_ (-ichna) or -_инична_ (-inichna) for a daughter; for example, Фока Foka (father's first name) – Фокич Fokich (male patronymic) – Фокична Fokichna (female patronymic); Кузьма Kuzma (father's first name) – Кузьмич Kuzmich (male patronymic) – Кузьминична Kuzminichna (female patronymic).

### Historical grounds

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Rurikname.JPG/250px-Rurikname.JPG)](/wiki/File:Rurikname.JPG)

The name [Rurik](/wiki/Rurik "Rurik")
 on a [Viking Age](/wiki/Viking_Age "Viking Age")
 runestone. All the princes of [Kievan Rus](/wiki/Kievan_Rus "Kievan Rus")
 had the patronymic [Ruerikovichi](/wiki/Rurikids "Rurikids")
.

Historical Russian naming conventions did not include surnames. A person's name included that of their father: e.g. _Иван Петров сын_ (Ivan Petrov syn) which means "Ivan, son of Peter". That is the origin of most Russian -ov surnames.

Modern -ovich- patronyms were originally a feature of the royal dynasty (Рюрико**вич**и, [Rueriko**vich**i, Rurikids](/wiki/Rurik_dynasty "Rurik dynasty")
, which makes the East Slavic patronym in its original meaning being similar to German _von_. From the 17th century, the second name with suffix -_ович_ (-_ovich_) was the privilege given by the [tsar](/wiki/Tsar "Tsar")
 to commoners. For example, in 1610, Tsar [Vasili IV](/wiki/Vasili_IV_of_Russia "Vasili IV of Russia")
 gave to the [Stroganovs](/wiki/Stroganov_family "Stroganov family")
, who were merchants, the privilege to use patronyms. As a tribute for developing the salt industry in Siberia, Pyotr Stroganov and all his issues were allowed to have a name with -_ovich_. The tsar wrote in the chart dated on 29 May, "... _to write him with_ ovich_, to try_ \[him\] _in Moscow only, not to fee_ \[him\] _by other fees, not to kiss a cross by himself_ \[which means not to swear during any processions\]"[\[7\]](#cite_note-8)
 In the 18th century, it was the family of merchants to have patronyms. By the 19th century, the -ovich form eventually became the default form of a patronymic.

### Legal basis

Everyone in Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus is supposed to have a tripartite name. Single mothers may give their children any patronym, and this does not have any legal consequences. Foreigners who adopt Russian citizenship are exempted from having a patronym. Now, an adult person is entitled to change patronyms if necessary,[\[8\]](#cite_note-9)
 such as to alienate themselves from the biological father (or to show respect for the adopted one) as well as to decide the same for an underage child.

### Matronymic

In modern Russia, there are cases when women raising a child without a father give the child their own name instead of a patronymic. This practice is not recognized by law, but the civil registry offices may meet such wishes. A common loophole is when mother's name is a feminine form of a masculine given name, even an obscure one.[\[9\]](#cite_note-10)

Family names
------------

[Family names](/wiki/Family_name "Family name")
 are generally used like in English.

In Russian, some common suffixes are -_ов_ (-ov), -_ев_ (-yev), meaning "belonging to" or "of the clan of/descendant of", e.g. Petrov = of the clan of/descendant of Petr (Peter), usually used for [patronymic surnames](/wiki/Patronymic_surname "Patronymic surname")
—or -_ский_ (-sky), an adjectival form, meaning "associated with" and usually used for [toponymic surnames](/wiki/Toponymic_surname "Toponymic surname")
. Historically, toponymic surnames may have been granted as a token of nobility; for example, the princely surname [Shuysky](/wiki/Shuysky "Shuysky")
 is indicative of the princedom based on the ownership of [Shuya](/wiki/Shuya_(inhabited_locality) "Shuya (inhabited locality)")
. Prince [Grigory Aleksandrovich Potemkin](/wiki/Grigory_Potemkin "Grigory Potemkin")
\-Tavricheski had the [victory title](/wiki/Victory_title "Victory title")
 'Tavricheski', as part of his surname, granted to him for the [annexation of Crimea by the Russian Empire](/wiki/Annexation_of_Crimea_by_the_Russian_Empire "Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Empire")
.

In the 19th and early 20th centuries, _\-off_ was a common transliteration of _\-ov_ for Russian family names in foreign languages such as French and German (like for the [Smirnoff](/wiki/Smirnoff "Smirnoff")
 and the [Davidoff](/wiki/Davidoff "Davidoff")
 brands).

Surnames of Ukrainian and Belarusian origin use the suffixes -ко (-ko), -ук (-uk), and -ич (-ych). For example, the family name _Писаренко_ ([Pisarenko](/wiki/Pisarenko "Pisarenko")
) is derived from the word for a scribe, and _Ковальчук_ ([Kovalchuk](/wiki/Kovalchuk "Kovalchuk")
) refers to a smith.

Less often, some versions of family names will have no suffix, e.g. Lebed, meaning swan, and Zhuk, meaning beetle (but see also Lebedev and Zhukov).

[Hyphenated surnames](/wiki/Hyphenated_surname "Hyphenated surname")
 like [Petrov-Vodkin](/wiki/Petrov-Vodkin "Petrov-Vodkin")
 are possible.

### Grammar

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Lesser_CoA_of_the_emperor_of_Russia.svg/250px-Lesser_CoA_of_the_emperor_of_Russia.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Lesser_CoA_of_the_emperor_of_Russia.svg)

The Coat of Arms of the _Романовы_ ([Romanovs](/wiki/Romanovs "Romanovs")
), the last Russian royal dynasty. The family name _Романов_ (Romanov) means "pertaining to (the name) Roman".

East Slavic languages are [synthetic languages](/wiki/Synthetic_languages "Synthetic languages")
 and have [grammatical cases](/wiki/Grammatical_cases "Grammatical cases")
 and [grammatical gender](/wiki/Grammatical_gender "Grammatical gender")
. Unlike [analytic languages](/wiki/Analytic_language "Analytic language")
 like English, which use prepositions ("to", "at", "on" etc.) to show the links and relations between words in a sentence, East Slavic suffixes are used much more broadly than prepositions. Words need the help of some suffix to integrate them into the sentence and to build a grammatically correct sentence. That includes names, unlike in German. Family names are declined based on the Slavic case system.

The surnames that originally are short (_\-ov_, _\-ev_, _\-in_) or full (_\-iy/-oy/-yy_) Slavic adjectives, have different forms depending on gender: male forms _\-ov_, _\-ev_, _\-in_ and _\-iy/-oy/-yy_ correspond to female forms _\-ova_, _\-eva_, _\-ina_ and _\-aya_, respectively. For example, the wife of _Борис Ельцин_ (Boris Yel'tsin) was _Наина Ельцин**а**_ (Naina Yel'tsin**a**); the wife of [Leo Tolst**oy**](/wiki/Leo_Tolstoy "Leo Tolstoy")
 was [Sophia Tolst**aya**](/wiki/Sophia_Tolstaya "Sophia Tolstaya")
, etc. All other, i.e. non-adjectival, surnames stay the same for both genders (including surnames ending with -_енко_ (_\-yenko_), -_ич_ (_\-ich_) etc.), unlike in many [West Slavic languages](/wiki/West_Slavic_languages "West Slavic languages")
, where the non-adjectival surname of men corresponds to derivative feminine adjectival surname (Novák → Nováková). Note the difference between patronymics and surnames ending with _\-ich_: surnames are the same for males and females, but patronymics are gender-dependent (for example, Ivan Petrov_ich_ Mirov_ich_ and Anna Petr_ovna_ Mirov_ich_)

This dependence of [grammatical gender](/wiki/Grammatical_gender "Grammatical gender")
 of adjectival surname on the gender of its owner is not considered to be changing the surname (compare the equivalent rule in [Polish](/wiki/Polish_name "Polish name")
, for example). The correct transliteration of such feminine surnames in English is debated: the names technically should be in their original form, but they sometimes appear in the masculine form.

The example of _Иванов_ (Ivanov), a family name, will be used:

| Grammatical  <br>case | Example of question | Masculine form |     | Feminine form |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cyrillic | Latin | Cyrillic | Latin |
| [Nominative](/wiki/Nominative_case "Nominative case") | Who? | _Иванов_ | Ivanov | _Иванова_ | Ivanova |
| [Genitive](/wiki/Genitive_case "Genitive case") | Whose? | _Ивано**ва**_ | Ivano**va** | _Ивано**вой**_ | Ivano**voy** |
| [Dative](/wiki/Dative_case "Dative case") | To whom? | _Ивано**ву**_ | Ivano**vu** | _Ивано**вой**_ | Ivano**voy** |
| [Accusative](/wiki/Accusative_case "Accusative case") | Whom? | _Ивано**ва**_ | Ivano**va** | _Ивано**ву**_ | Ivano**vu** |
| [Instrumental](/wiki/Instrumental_case "Instrumental case") | By whom? | _Ивано**вым**_ | Ivano**vym** | _Ивано**вой**_ | Ivano**voy** |
| [Locative](/wiki/Locative_case "Locative case")<br> (Prepositional) | About whom? | _Ивано**ве**_ | Ivano**ve** | _Ивано**вой**_ | Ivano**voy** |

The surnames which are not grammatically adjectives (_Zhuk_, _Gogol_, _Barchuk_, _Kupala_ etc.) declines in cases and numbers as the corresponding common noun. The exclusion is when a woman has a surname which is grammatically a noun of masculine gender; in such case, the surname is not declined. For example, Ivan and Anna Zhuk in dative case ("to whom?") would be: Иван**у** Жук**у** (_Ivan**u**_ _Zhuk**u**_), but Анн**е** Жук (_Ann**e** Zhuk_).

Family names are generally inherited from one's parents. As in English, on marriage, women usually adopt the surname of the husband; the opposite, when the husband adopt the maiden surname of his wife, very rarely occurs. Rarely, both spouses keep their pre-marriage family names. The fourth, very rare but still legal way is the taking a double surname; for example, in marriage of Ivanov (he) and Petrovskaya (she), the spouses may adopt the family name Ivanov-Petrovsky and Ivanova-Petrovskaya, correspondingly.

Slavicisation of foreign names
------------------------------

### Slavicisation of foreign surnames

See also: [Azerbaijanization of surnames](/wiki/Azerbaijanization_of_surnames "Azerbaijanization of surnames")

Some surnames in those languages have been [russified](/wiki/Russification "Russification")
 since the 19th century: the surname of Kazakh former [president](/wiki/President_(government_title) "President (government title)")
 [Nursultan Nazarbayev](/wiki/Nursultan_Nazarbayev "Nursultan Nazarbayev")
 has a Russian "-yev" [suffix](/wiki/Suffix "Suffix")
, which literally means "of Nazar-bay" (in which "bay" is a Turkic native [noble](/wiki/Nobility "Nobility")
 [rank](/wiki/Ranks_of_nobility_and_peerage "Ranks of nobility and peerage")
: compare [Turkish](/wiki/Turkish_people "Turkish people")
 "[bey](/wiki/Bey "Bey")
", [Uzbek](/wiki/Uzbeks "Uzbeks")
 "boy" "bek", and [Kyrghyz](/wiki/Kyrgyz_people "Kyrgyz people")
 "bek"). The frequency of such russification varies greatly by country.

After incorporation of [Azerbaijan](/wiki/Azerbaijan "Azerbaijan")
 into the [Soviet Union](/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union")
, it became obligatory to register their surnames and to add a Russian suffix such as _\-yev_ or _\-ov_ for men and _\-yeva_ or _\-ova_ for women.[\[11\]](#cite_note-12)
 Since the majority did not have official surnames, the problem was resolved by adopting the name of the father and adding the mentioned suffixes. Examples are [Aliyev](/wiki/Aliyev "Aliyev")
, [Huseynov](/wiki/Huseynov "Huseynov")
, and [Mammadov](/wiki/Mammadov "Mammadov")
.

Since 1930s and 1940s, surnames and patronymics were obligatory in [Uzbekistan](/wiki/Uzbekistan "Uzbekistan")
.[\[12\]](#cite_note-13)
 The surname could be derived from the name of the father by adding the suffixes -ev after vowels or soft consonants and -ov in all other cases. Examples are [Rashidov](/wiki/Rashidov "Rashidov")
, [Beknazarov](/wiki/Beknazarov "Beknazarov")
 and [Abdullaev](/wiki/Abdullaev "Abdullaev")
. Most of the people born in this time had the same surname as their patronymic.

### Slavicisation of foreign patronymics

By law, foreign persons who adopt [Russian citizenship](/wiki/Russian_citizenship "Russian citizenship")
 are allowed to have no patronymic.[\[13\]](#cite_note-14)
 Some adopt non-Slavonic patronymics as well. For example, the Russian politician [Irina Hakamada](/wiki/Irina_Hakamada "Irina Hakamada")
's patronym is _Муцуовна_ (Mutsuovna) because her [Japanese](/wiki/Japanese_name "Japanese name")
 father's given name was Mutsuo. The ethnicity of origin generally remains recognizable in Russified names. Other examples are [Kazakh](/wiki/Kazakh_language "Kazakh language")
 _ұлы_ (_uly_; transcribed into Latin script as _\-uly_, as in [Nursultan Abish**uly** Nazarbayev](/wiki/Nursultan_Nazarbayev "Nursultan Nazarbayev")
), or [Azeri](/wiki/Patronymic#Azeri "Patronymic")
 _оглы/оғлу_ (_oglu_) (as in [Heydar Alirza **oglu** Aliyev](/wiki/Heydar_Aliyev "Heydar Aliyev")
); Kazakh _қызы_ (transcribed into Latin script as -_qyzy_, as in [Dariga Nursultan**qyzy** Nazarbayeva](/wiki/Dariga_Nazarbayeva "Dariga Nazarbayeva")
).\[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")\
_\] Such Turkic patronymics were officially allowed in the Soviet Union.\[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")\
_\]

[Bruno Pontecorvo](/wiki/Bruno_Pontecorvo "Bruno Pontecorvo")
, after he emigrated to the Soviet Union, was known as _Бруно Максимович Понтекорво_ (Bruno Maximovich Pontekorvo) in the Russian scientific community, as his father's given name was _Massimo_ (corresponding to Russian Максим (Maksim)). His sons have been known by names _Джиль Брунович Понтекорво_ (Gigl Brunovich Pontecorvo), _Антонио Брунович Понтекорво_ (Antonio Brunovich Pontecorvo) and _Тито Брунович Понтекорво_ (Tito Brunovich Pontekorvo).

Forms of address
----------------

### Common rules

*   For informal communication, only the first name is used: Иван Ivan. Even more informally, [diminutives](/wiki/Diminutives "Diminutives")
     (several can be formed from one name) are often used.
*   In rural areas, the patronymic name alone (_Петрович_ Petrovich, _Ивановна_ Ivanovna) is used by old people among themselves, but young people sometimes use the form for irony. Also, younger people can use the form for much older people for both respect and informality. For example, a much younger man with a very good relationship with his elder colleague may use a patronymic and the "ty" form, but using the first name alone is generally inappropriate. Using a diminutive (like in most informal communication) would nearly always be very impolite.
*   The family name alone (_Петров_, Petrov) is used, much more rarely, in formal communications. It is commonly used by school teachers to address their students. Informally, Russians are starting to call people by their surnames alone for irony.
*   the form "first name + patronymic" (for instance, _Иван Иванович_, Ivan Ivanovich):
    *   is the feature of official communication (for instance, students in schools and universities call their teachers in the form of "first name + patronymic" only);
    *   may convey the speaker's respect for the recipient. Historically, patronymics were reserved for the royal dynasty (Рюрико**вич**и, [Rueriko**vich**i](/wiki/Rurikovich "Rurikovich")
        )
*   The full three-name form (for instance, _Иван Иванович Петров_ Ivan Ivanovich Petrov) is used mostly for official documents. With some exceptions, everyone in Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus is supposed to have a three-part name. This form is also used on formal occasions and for introducing oneself to a person who is likely to write down the full name, like a police officer. The family name is placed first (_Петров Иван Иванович_, Petrov Ivan Ivanovich) in various documents, when sorting by personal name is important.

Historically, [diminutives](/wiki/Diminutive "Diminutive")
 of the given names were used in reference to commoners, to indicate an their low status: [Stenka Razin](/wiki/Stenka_Razin "Stenka Razin")
, [Grishka Rasputin](/wiki/Grishka_Rasputin "Grishka Rasputin")
, etc. A diminutive could be used by persons of a higher class when referring to themselves to indicate humility, e.g., when addressing to the [tsar](/wiki/Tsar "Tsar")
.

The choice of addressing format is closely linked to the [choice of second-person pronoun](/wiki/T%E2%80%93V_distinction#Russian "T–V distinction")
. Russian language distinguishes:

*   formal _вы_ (vy, "you"); respectful _Вы_ ("Vy", "You") may be capitalized in formal correspondence, but plural _вы_ ("vy", "you") is not.
*   informal _ты_ (ty, "you", "thou" in old English);

_Вы_ ("Vy") is the plural of both forms to address a pair or group. Historically, it comes from German, under [Peter the Great](/wiki/Peter_the_Great "Peter the Great")
, which uses [_du_ and _Sie_](/wiki/T%E2%80%93V_distinction#Sie_and_du "T–V distinction")
 similarly.\[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")\
_\]

Other than the use of patronymics, Russian forms of address in Russian are very similar to English ones.

Also, the meaning of the form of address strongly depends on the choice of a V-T form:

| Vy or ty | Form | Male example | Female example | Use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Using "Vy" | Full three-name form | Anatoliy Pavlovich Ivanov | Varvara Mikhailovna Kuznetsova | Official documents, very formal occasions (when necessary) |
| First name + patronymic | Anatoliy Pavlovich | Varvara Mikhailovna | General formal or respectful form |
| Surname | Ivanov | Kuznetsova | Formal. Often used by a person of a higher social position (like a teacher talking to a student) |
| Informal first name + informal patronymic | Tol' Palych | Varvara Mikhalna | Respectful but less formal |
| Full first name | Anatoliy | Varvara |
| Diminutive first name | Tolya | Varya | Friendly but still somewhat formal |
| Affectionate first name |     | Varechka | Used almost exclusively towards women, showing fondness but still keeping some formality (like to a younger colleague) |
| Using "Ty" | First name + patronymic | Anatoliy Pavlovich | Varvara Mikhailovna | Can be used between friends on semi-formal occasions or ironically |
| Informal patronymic | Palych | Mikhalna | Combining familiarity and respect |
| Surname | Ivanov | Kuznetsova | Similar in use to a "vy" form but less formal |
| Full first name | Anatoliy | Varvara | Friendly but with a tone of formality. If the name has no diminutive form (Yegor), also used informally |
| Diminutive first name | Tolia | Varya | General informal form |
| Colloquial first name | Tolik | Var'ka | Very familiar form |
| Slang first name | Tolyan | Varyukha |
| Affectionate first name | Tolen'ka | Varechka | Tender, affectionate form |

Using a "ty" form with a person who dislikes it or on inappropriate occasions can be an insult, especially the surname alone.

### Adjectives

Other East Slavic languages use the same adjectives of their literal translation if they differ from Russian analogue. All East Slavic languages are synthetic languages, and grammatical genders are used. Thus, the suffix of an adjective changes with the sex of the recipient.

In Russian, adjectives before names are generally restricted to written forms of communication. Adjectives like _Любимый / Любимая_ (lyubimiy / lyubimaya, "beloved") and _Милый / Милая_ (miliy / milaya, "sweetheart") are informal, and _Уважаемый / Уважаемая_ (uvazhayemiy / uvazhayemaya, literally "respected") is highly formal. Some adjectives, like _Дорогой / Дорогая_ (dorogoy / dorogaya, "dear"), can be used in both formal and informal letters.

**Russian passport machine-readable entry**
-------------------------------------------

Russian domestic passport has special rules and method of forming a machine-readable entry. The machine-readable record contains the surname, name, patronymic, date of birth (year, month, day) of the passport holder, sex of the passport holder, series and number of the passport, code of the migration department issuing the passport, date of issue of the passport, as well as the type of document, state issuing the passport, citizenship of the passport holder.

A machine-readable entry consists of two lines of 44 characters each. The machine-readable entry area is located in the opposite fold of the bottom quarter of the third page of the passport.

A machine-readable entry is entered into the passport with a special printer using the font OCR-B type 1 (Стандарт ИСО 1073/П).

To fill in the positions of characters 6–44 of the top line of a machine-readable record, the “modernized clair” information coding method is used, in which the letters of the Russian alphabet correspond to certain letters of the Latin alphabet and Arabic numbers:

letters of the Russian alphabet 

|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |

To fill in the positions of the characters on the bottom line of a machine-readable record, a digital method of encoding information is used, except for the positions of characters 11 – 13 and 21.

There is a data structure of the upper and lower machine-readable lines.

**Russian internal passport number format**
-------------------------------------------

These details will tell you how to read a Passport series and number Russian. The series and passport number are recorded in the format XX XX YYYYYY, where XX XX is the 4-digit passport series and YYYYYY is the 6-digit passport number.

Now you know how many digits does a Russian passport have

![numbers in russia internal passport series number and id number](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20600%20137'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Russian passport number example

The first two digits of the passport series correspond to the OKATO code of the region in which the passport was issued; the third and fourth digits of the passport series correspond to the last two digits of the year of issue of the passport form (deviation of 1-3 years is allowed).

What is a series and passport number of a citizen of the Russian Federation? This is an original 10-digit numeric combination. Without looking closely, you can see that there is a small gap between the first four digits and the next six, which distinguishes the series from the number. The first four numerical values are a series of the document, and the remaining six are its number.

If you look closely, the first 4 digits are also pairwise separated from each other, for example, 52 17. The first pair number allows you to find out in which area the citizen received his document.

The digital code in the document allows you to distinguish one document from another. A single surname and name would not be enough, since many people with the same surname, name and date of birth can live in the Russian Federation.

In such a situation, only a given numerical code helps to distinguish one citizen from another. After all, the chance that two citizens have a numerical code will be identical is zero.

If you enter these values in a special database, then the result will be all the information about the person (his name, information about marriage, children, etc.).

**Russian passport number sample**
----------------------------------

Passport number Russia

![Russia passport number sample](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20400%2087'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Russia passport number

Example Russian passport serial number: a passport of a series 45 04 was issued in the city of Moscow, and a passport of a series 37 11 was issued in the Kurgan region in 2011.

For example, if the beginning of the ten-digit code contains the number 52, this means that the document was received in the Nizhny Novgorod region. After the first two-digit number follows the second, which means the year of issue.

From example 52-17 it can be understood that the passport was issued in 2017.

Attention! Sometimes the second number does not coincide with the year of issue, that is, instead of 17 it may be 16 or 18. There is an explanation for this.

This can happen when the issued forms for 2017 ended, and in the passport office began to use forms for the next, 2018. Or vice versa, the year 2016 has passed, and the forms remained on it.

Therefore, if the second two-digit number does not coincide with the year of issue, there is nothing criminal in it.

![Russian passport ID number](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20450%20607'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Russian passport ID number

![Russia passport number](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20450%20318'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Russian passport number format

The photo shows the second and third pages of the passport of a person who is a citizen of Russia. On the right vertically along the entire length of the pages of the document, a series and a number are printed in red font. Russian passport ID number

The first numerical value, consisting of 2 digits – 39, means the area in which the citizen received the document. In the situation presented in the photo above, the document was issued in the Kaliningrad region.

Let’s look at another example with a different arrangement of partially original code of Russian passport series and number.

![Russian passport series and number](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20450%20636'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Russian passport series and number

On the page on the lower right, you can clearly see numbers from small punctures. Everything is similar here, only spaces between numerical values are less noticeable than in the first example.

The last six digits are the serial number in the state database.

Based on this, we can conclude that the first 4 digits of many citizens of the Russian Federation can be identical. But the next six digits of all people are absolutely unique.

 and would remain unchanged.[\[215\]](#cite_note-219)

Arthur Novosiltsev / Moskva News Agency

The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday boosted its 2024 growth forecast for Russia, with surging government spending on the war continuing to provide a powerful economic stimulus for the country.

The IMF also slashed its outlook for Ukraine, whose economy and infrastructure have been battered by two and a half years of conflict. Both Russia and Ukraine are spending huge sums to continue fighting in the war, with Moscow's state expenditures having helped the economy grow strongly despite a barrage of Western sanctions.

According to its latest forecast, the IMF said it expects the Russian economy to expand by 3.6% in 2024, up from a previous forecast of 3.2%. But it also cut its prediction for next year's growth from 1.5% to 1.3% amid signs of mounting economic problems.

Russia's Central Bank has repeatedly warned of the dangers of the government's military spending, saying the economy has been “overheating” for months. High inflation — 8.6% in September — and intense labor shortages are also posing economic headaches for Moscow.

In a rare move, President Vladimir Putin acknowledged earlier this month that Russia's record low unemployment of 2.4% was a “limiting factor” for the country's growth prospects.

Russia's Central Bank has raised interest rates to 19% in a bid to bring inflation under control, and it could increase them again at a meeting this coming Friday.

Russia's Finance Ministry, meanwhile, proposed raising military spending next year by almost 30% to around $145 billion, with combined defense and security spending set to account for approximately 40% of state expenditures.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "In October 2024 the International Monetary Fund (IMF) declared Russia the fourth-largest economy in the world."

## Actions
```
web_search("IMF Russia economy October 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
In October 2024, the IMF published the World Economic Outlook, discussing global growth and structural reforms (<image:4533>). The IMF held a meeting on October 24-25, 2024, in Washington, D.C. According to the statement by the Minister of Finance of the Russian Federation, Anton Siluanov, the Russian economy "continues to show consistently high growth rates, systematically surpassing most forecasts, including those of the IMF."

The Moscow Times reported on October 22, 2024, that the IMF boosted its 2024 growth forecast for Russia (<image:4535>). The IMF expects the Russian economy to expand by 3.6% in 2024.

*   [https://meetings.imf.org/-/media/AMSM/Files/AM2024/IMFC/Russia.ashx](https://meetings.imf.org/-/media/AMSM/Files/AM2024/IMFC/Russia.ashx)

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the IMF published the World Economic Outlook in October 2024, which discussed the Russian economy. The Moscow Times reported that the IMF boosted its 2024 growth forecast for Russia. However, the provided evidence does not explicitly state that the IMF declared Russia the fourth-largest economy in the world.

The evidence mentions the IMF's growth forecast for Russia but does not provide any information about the country's ranking in terms of economic size.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available information.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "In October 2024 the International Monetary Fund (IMF) declared Russia the fourth-largest economy in the world."

## Actions
```
web_search("IMF Russia economy October 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
In October 2024, the IMF published the World Economic Outlook, discussing global growth and structural reforms (<image:4533>). The IMF held a meeting on October 24-25, 2024, in Washington, D.C. According to the statement by the Minister of Finance of the Russian Federation, Anton Siluanov, the Russian economy "continues to show consistently high growth rates, systematically surpassing most forecasts, including those of the IMF."

The Moscow Times reported on October 22, 2024, that the IMF boosted its 2024 growth forecast for Russia (<image:4535>). The IMF expects the Russian economy to expand by 3.6% in 2024.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the IMF published the World Economic Outlook in October 2024, which discussed the Russian economy. The Moscow Times reported that the IMF boosted its 2024 growth forecast for Russia. However, the provided evidence does not explicitly state that the IMF declared Russia the fourth-largest economy in the world.

The evidence mentions the IMF's growth forecast for Russia but does not provide any information about the country's ranking in terms of economic size.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available information.

From [Source](https://www.russiamatters.org/blog/russias-economy-collapsing): 
Content: "For one, the [IMF](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2025/01/17/world-economic-outlook-update-january-2025)
 and [World Bank](https://thedocs.worldbank.org/en/doc/c50bc3c87bc2666b9e5fa6699b0b2849-0050012025/related/GEP-Jan-2025-Analysis-ECA.pdf)
 estimate that the Russian economy grew by 3.8% and 3.4%, respectively, in 2024.3 Looking ahead, both expect the Russian economy to continue growing in 2025–2026, even though this growth is expected to slow down. The same year saw 19 new Russian dollar billionaires join Forbes’s ranking, which is the highest number of new dollar billionaires Russia has produced since 2011, according to [Re: Russia](https://re-russia.net/en/analytics/0233/)
.

As the economy grew in 2024, so did Russia’s budget revenues, even though this growth was not sufficient to eliminate the aforementioned budget deficit. Olga Chyzh of the University of Toronto also took a dim view of the Russian economy in her recent commentary for The Guardian, entitled “A string of assassinations, a [faltering economy](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/dec/19/russia-assassinations-economy-workers-putin)
, a shortage of workers: the pressure on Putin is ratcheting up.” In this Dec. 2024, commentary, Chyzh writes that Russia’s “economy is faltering under the combined strain of the war and Western sanctions.” “War-driven salary increases … have triggered a vicious cycle of inflation and subsequent interest-rate hikes. Writing in The Hill in October 2024, he predicts that a “Russian economic meltdown is coming next year.” “Leonid Brezhnev’s Soviet Union should have taught Putin a lesson,” warns Motyl, who has repeatedly predicted [Russia’s collapse](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=Alexander+Motyl+Russia+collapse)
. 5, 2024, entitled “[The collapse of the Russian economy](https://www.counteroffensive.news/p/the-collapse-of-the-russian-economy)
,” on American journalist Tim Mak’s Substack, “Counteroffensive.” The Kyiv-based Euromaidan Press outlet then published a commentary by [Yurii Bohdanov](https://euromaidanpress.com/author/yuriybohdanov/ "View all posts by Yurii Bohdanov")
 on Jan. 17, 2025, in which he claims that “even ‘freezing’ the war in Ukraine will not solve Russia’s economic problems… and a freeze only delays the inevitable collapse.” 

### Russia Doesn’t Have a Clean Bill of Health

Some of the aforementioned criticism of what the [IMF](https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/PPPSH@WEO/OEMDC/ADVEC/WEOWORLD)
 ranks as the world’s 4th largest economy in terms of PPP is valid. In fact, Russia’s budget revenues in December 2024 reached more than 4 trillion rubles ($40 billion), up by 28% compared to December 2023, the highest level recorded in ministry data beginning from January 2011, according to [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-21/russia-s-budget-revenue-surges-to-record-in-december-despite-sanctions "(opens in a new window)")
.5 One sector of the Russian economy which provides much of the money6 that is accumulated in the Russian budget and that the Kremlin then spends on its war, is the energy sector. Gazprom, the national gas champion, is estimated to have lost more [than $3 billion](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/gazprom-reports-9-month-loss-32-billion-2024-10-29/)
 in the first nine months of 2024, for instance.)

### Conclusion 

No economy is completely healthy, and Russia’s is, by far, no exception, particularly given Western sanctions and its rampant spending on the military-industrial complex and the war against Ukraine.

Is Russia’s Economy Collapsing?
===============================

February 06, 2025

[Simon Saradzhyan](/authors/simon-saradzhyan)

The past few months have seen a number of Russia watchers echo each other’s proclamations that the Russian economy is either already collapsing or close to crumbling. 

Will these predictions materialize?

Renovated in 2018, the facility in Toropets is estimated to have stored tonnes upon tonnes of military goods, including explosives, artillery shells and ballistic missiles.

A Ukrainian drone attack on a significant Russian weapons stockpile in the Tver region in the early hours of Wednesday might be the Ukrainian army's biggest hit against Moscow's arsenal since early 2022.

The blast from the strike was so strong that earthquake monitoring stations picked it up as if it were a minor earthquake, while NASA reported a series of heat sources spotted by its equipment from space.

The facility in Toropets is estimated to have stored around 30,000 tonnes of military munitions. The destruction of the ammunition that was stored there will most likely negatively affect the northern operational group of the Russian army.

But what is the Russian military storage facility in Toropets and how important is it?

Renovated in 2018, the facility in Toropets is estimated to have stored tonnes upon tonnes of military goods, including explosives, artillery shells and ballistic missiles.

The former Russian deputy defence minister Dmitry Bulgakov — who was arrested earlier this year on corruption charges — said after the renovations that the site met the "highest international standards" and could defend weapons from missiles and "even a small nuclear attack".

The storage site covered an area of over 5 square kilometres in size and a perimeter of more than 12 kilometres long. 

**Which missiles were stored at the facility?**
-----------------------------------------------

The town of Toropets is situated around 470 kilometers north of the Ukrainian border and the destruction of the ammunition that was stored there will most likely negatively affect the northern operational group of the Russian army, including the supply of troops in Kursk, Belgorod and Bryansk.

According to Ukrainian sources, the military site in Toropets reportedly housed fuel tanks, as well as missiles intended for Iskander missile systems, Tochka-U missile systems, guided aerial bombs and assorted artillery ammunition.

The head of Ukraine's Centre for Countering Disinformation, Andriy Kovalenko, said that in addition to its own ammunition, Russia had also started to store North Korean munitions in Toropets.

Maxar satellite service collected imagery clearly shows the extent of the damage from the Ukrainian drone attack causing a series of explosions, according to a photo shared by the Russia Team Lead at the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). 

The imagery shows large pillars of smoke covering much of the area, while a closer look at the ammunition storage area indicates that fires continue to burn in and near some bunkers, ISW's George Barros added.

**Have the storage bunkers been destroyed?**
--------------------------------------------

Most of the ammunition is presumably stored underground, so the question is whether Ukraine used any drones that could have penetrated inside the bunkers.

A full damage assessment remains impossible due to the thick smoke above the site. However, the possible destruction of the bunkers might have also been the result of Moscow not respecting its own regulations by placing the bunkers too close together, for example.

While repeatedly calling on the West to lift the restrictions over the use of long-range missiles deep into Russian territory, Ukraine has been using its home-produced UAVs to strike as deep as 1,800 kilometres into Russia, as was the case in the city of Orsk.

LONDON, Sept 18 (Reuters) - A large-scale Ukrainian drone attack on Russia triggered an earthquake-sized blast at a major arsenal in the Tver region on Wednesday, forcing the evacuation of a nearby town, war bloggers and some media reported.

Unverified video and images on social media showed a huge ball of flame blasting into the night sky and multiple detonations thundering across a lake about 380 km (240 miles) west of Moscow.

NASA satellites picked up intense heat sources emanating from an area of about 14 square kilometres (5 square miles) at the site in the early hours and earthquake monitoring stations noted what sensors thought was a small [earthquake, opens new tab](https://www.volcanodiscovery.com/earthquakes/quake-info/9611698/mag2quake-Sep-18-2024-BALTIC-STATES-BELARUS-NW-RUSSIA-REGION.html#google_vignette)
 in the area.

"The enemy hit an ammunition depot in the area of Toropets," said Yuri Podolyaka, a Ukrainian-born, pro-Russian military blogger. "Everything that can burn is already burning there (and exploding)."

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, speaking in his nightly video address, hailed the outcome of the attack without referring specifically to the target.

"A very important result was achieved last night on Russian territory and such actions weaken the enemy," Zelenskiy said. "I thank everyone involved. Such precision is truly inspiring."

He thanked the SBU security service, the HUR intelligence service and the Special Operations Forces.

A source in Ukraine's SBU state security service had earlier told Reuters the drone attack had destroyed [a warehouse storing missiles](/world/europe/ukraine-destroyed-arsenal-russias-tver-region-kyiv-security-source-says-2024-09-18/)
, guided bombs and artillery ammunition.

Russian state media have in the past reported that a major arsenal for conventional weapons was located at the site of the blasts. State media, now subject to military censorship laws, was muted in its reporting on Wednesday.

Igor Rudenya, governor of the Tver region, said that Ukrainian drones had been shot down, that a fire had broken out and that some residents were being evacuated. He did not say what was burning.

One woman told Reuters that members of her family had been evacuated from Toropets.

"A fire started with explosions," said the woman, who identified herself only as Irina.

Rudenya later said the situation in Toropets was stable as of midday local time (0900 GMT) and that evacuated residents could return. The fire had been put out and there were no recorded fatalities, he said.

Russia and Ukraine each reported dozens of enemy drone attacks on their territory overnight, with Russian forces advancing in eastern [Ukraine](https://www.reuters.com/topic/event/ukraine-crisis/)
.

MAJOR EXPLOSION
---------------

The size of the main blast shown in the unverified social media video was consistent with 200-240 tons of high explosives detonating, said George William Herbert of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey in California.

A Toropets chatroom on the Russian social media site VK was flooded with messages of support from other parts of the country and offers of help to people fleeing the town.

Some people were asking whether buildings at specific addresses were still standing.

"People, does anyone know what's happened to Kudino village??? They told me nothing is left of our house," posted one woman.

Another woman replied: "It's horror there." Kudino is a village 4.5 km (2.8 miles) northeast of Toropets.

Some war bloggers asked how drones could trigger such large blasts at what was thought to be a highly fortified facility.

According to an RIA state news agency report from 2018, Russia was building an arsenal for the storage of missiles, ammunition and explosives in Toropets, a 1,000-year-old town, with a population of just over 11,000.

Dmitry Bulgakov, then a deputy defence minister, told RIA in 2018 that the facility could defend weapons from missiles and even a small nuclear attack. Bulgakov was arrested earlier this year on corruption charges, which he denies.

"It (the concrete facilities) ensures their reliable and safe storage, protects them from air and missile strikes and even from the damaging factors of a nuclear explosion," RIA quoted Bulgakov as saying at the time.

Some Russians on chat groups expressed anger.

"Why wasn't the ammunition underground?! What are you doing???? In Kudino, houses were blown away! Why is the forest burning and no one is there... What kind of negligence is this!!!!" one woman posted.

Russia reported that its air defence units had destroyed 54 drones launched against five Russian regions overnight, without mentioning Tver. Ukraine said it had [shot down 46 of 52 drones](/world/europe/russian-drones-attack-energy-facilities-ukraines-sumy-authorities-say-2024-09-18/)
 launched by Moscow overnight and that Russia had used three guided air missiles which did not reach their targets.

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian [drones struck a large military depot in a town deep inside Russia](https://apnews.com/article/poland-us-blinken-duda-ukraine-54232b14cae7785df02f9d48a77e7823)
 overnight, causing a huge fire and forcing some residents to evacuate, a Ukrainian official and Russian news reports said Wednesday. At least 13 people were injured, Russia’s Health Ministry added.

Meanwhile, a senior U.S. diplomat said [Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-kursk-incursion-gamble-battlefield-e862afd58c65d6d2d5b7b3747423ca4d)
 has a workable plan to end the war, now in its third year, although its details have not been publicly disclosed.

Ukraine claimed the strike destroyed military warehouses in Toropets, a town in Russia’s Tver region about 380 kilometers (240 miles) northwest of Moscow and about 500 kilometers (300 miles) from the border with Ukraine.

The attack was carried out by Ukraine’s Security Service, along with Ukraine’s Intelligence and Special Operations Forces, a Kyiv security official told The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the operation.

According to the official, the depot housed Iskander and Tochka-U missiles, as well as glide bombs and artillery shells. He said the facility caught fire in the strike and was burning across an area 6 kilometers (4 miles) wide.

Among the destroyed ammunition were North Korean KN-23 short-range ballistic missiles, another official, in Ukraine’s Intelligence Office, told AP. He also was not authorized to comment publicly and didn’t provide evidence to support his claim.

Russia and North Korea signed [a landmark pact](https://apnews.com/article/russia-putin-kim-north-korea-pact-556492779b6a32c4cf74b992741d91a8)
 in June that envisioned mutual military assistance between Moscow and Pyongyang.

More than 100 domestically produced exploding drones were deployed in the attack on the depot, the Ukrainian intelligence official added.

Russian state news agency RIA Novosti quoted regional authorities as saying air defense systems were working to repel a “massive drone attack” on Toropets, which has a population of about 11,000. The agency also reported a fire and the evacuations, and the Health Ministry said 13 people were hospitalized in the region after the attack.

Tver regional Gov. Igor Rudenya later said all evacuees could return home.

Successful Ukrainian strikes deep inside Russia have become more common as Kyiv developed its drone technology.

Zelenskyy also is seeking approval from Western nations for Ukraine to use the sophisticated weapons they are providing to hit targets inside Russia. Some Western leaders have balked at that, fearing they could be dragged into the conflict.

Part of Kyiv’s strategy is targeting of military equipment, ammunition and infrastructure deep inside Russia, as well as making civilians feel some of the consequences of the war that is being fought largely inside Ukraine.

The swift push by Ukrainian forces [into Russia’s Kursk border region](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-kursk-incursion-putin-1178b99b32b476816db3a48ffa06b11a)
 last month fits into that plan, which apparently seeks to compel Russian President Vladimir Putin to back down.

Putin, however, has shown no signs of that [and has been trying to grind down Ukraine’s resolve](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-putin-military-numbers-9c5554302486adfe7b3d69cb297f8a98)
 through attritional warfare and also sap the West’s support for Kyiv by drawing out the conflict. That has come at a price, however, as the U.K. Defense Ministry estimates the war has probably killed or wounded more than 600,000 Russian troops.

On Tuesday, Putin ordered the country’s military to [increase its number of troops](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-putin-military-numbers-9c5554302486adfe7b3d69cb297f8a98)
 by 180,000 to a total of 1.5 million by Dec. 1.

Zelenskyy announced his war plan in his nightly address on Monday, saying it’s 90% ready and will be presented to allies over the next week.

He said Ukraine’s [plan for victory](https://apnews.com/video/ukraine-government-kyiv-volodymyr-zelenskyy-ukraine-war-and-unrest-be06ac55f33246fd96f1898bac5a6884)
 includes not only battlefield goals but also diplomatic and economic wins. The plan has been kept under wraps but the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said at a news conference Tuesday that Washington officials have seen it.

“We think it lays out a strategy and a plan that can work,” she said, adding that the United States will bring it up with other world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly in New York next week. She did not comment on what the plan contained.

 The blast wave spread up to 300 km (200 mi) and was estimated to have a [TNT equivalent](/wiki/TNT_equivalent "TNT equivalent")
 of either 200 to 240 tons or 1.3 to 1.8 kilotons of high-explosives.[\[2\]](#cite_note-reuters20240918-2)

Video shows explosions after drone attack on Russian ammunition depot

00:58

CNN  — 

A Ukrainian drone attack launched overnight destroyed an ammunition depot in the western Russian region of Tver, a source from Ukraine’s Security Service (SBU) told CNN on Wednesday, causing a massive blast.

The Ukrainian drones targeted the Russian defense ministry-operated warehouse in the city of Toropets, which was storing Iskander tactical missile systems, Tochka-U tactical missile systems, guided aerial bombs and artillery ammunition, the source said.

Large fires broke out from the debris of drones repelled by local air defenses, the regional government said, prompting the governor, Igor Rudenya, to order a partial evacuation of the area during the early hours of Wednesday.

Earthquake monitors now believe explosions from the drone attack may have generated seismic activity. Ben Dando, a seismologist at the Norwegian seismology research foundation NORSAR, told CNN that its sensors “detected seismic signals, of magnitude 2.5 to 2.8, in northwest Russia which look to be associated with the drone attack launched by Ukraine.”

NORSAR, which has been using seismic monitors since 2022 to evaluate the impact of the war in Ukraine, is currently analyzing the preliminary data to capture the full extent of the blast, Dando added.

Satellite images taken by Maxar Technologies on Wednesday morning showed huge plumes of smoke rising up from several depot buildings, as well as extensive damage to the buildings and nearby forest.

Fires continue to burn, as seen in the Maxar Technologies images.

Russian state news agency TASS reported that a drone attack had been launched on the city of Toropets overnight causing a fire “due to the fall of debris,” without specifically mentioning any targeting of a weapons facility.

Videos circulating on social media, verified by CNN, showed loud detonations and multiple buildings in the depot complex on fire.

Affected residents, including 11 children, have already been evacuated to the settlements of Kunya and Velikiye Luki in the neighbouring Pskov region, TASS said. No civilians are thought to have been injured in the drone attack, the news agency reported, citing Rudenya.

“Now we are engaged in evacuating the population, residents, maintaining public order,” Rudenya said in a later video statement, stressing that multiple emergency service units were involved in the response.

Rudenya made the call to evacuate so emergency services at the scene could work fully to bring the blazes under control, the local government said in a post on its official Telegram channel.

The Ukrainian security source told CNN that attacks of this nature are being used “methodically” to reduce Russia’s missile potential, adding that plans for further attacks on “similar” Russian military facilities are “proceeding.”

Toropets is located around 300 miles from the Ukrainian border and about 250 miles west of Moscow.

Ukraine has been pushing its key allies, including the United States, to give the go-ahead to carry out missile strikes on targets deeper into Russian territory. Last week, Russian President Vladimir Putin [warned NATO members](https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/12/europe/putin-warns-nato-missiles-hnk-latam-intl/index.html)
 that lifting restrictions on Ukraine’s use of long-range missile systems would mean entering into war with Russia itself.

Tver Oblast Governor Igor Rudenya said on Telegram that a fire had broken out in Toropets caused by falling drone debris but claimed the situation was "under control." He later announced an evacuation of part of the town's population.

Tver was not mentioned in a Russian defense ministry report that 54 drones launched over five regions had been shot down overnight.

The claim is demonstrably false because the evidence from multiple reliable sources confirms that the depot was hit by a Ukrainian drone attack, not a NATO strike. `false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image depicts a Russian ammunition depot in Toropets, Tver Oblast, before and after a Ukrainian drone attack, not a NATO strike. The attack, which occurred on September 17-18, 2024, caused a large explosion and fires, as reported by [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toropets_depot_explosions) and [CNN](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/18/europe/ukraine-russian-weapons-depot-drone-attack-intl). The depot stored various munitions, and the explosion was equivalent to between 1.3 and 1.8 kilotons of TNT, as stated by [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/russia-tver-ukraine-drones-1955582).

Biden approves nuclear strategy refocusing on China threat – report
===================================================================

This article is more than 1 year old

White House says plan was approved earlier this year and was not a response to a single country or threat

[Joe Biden](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden)
 has approved a US nuclear strategy to prepare for possible coordinated nuclear confrontations with Russia, China and North Korea, according to a New York Times [report](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/us/politics/biden-nuclear-china-russia.html)
 on Tuesday.

On Tuesday, the White House said the president approved the plan earlier this year and it was not a response to a single country or threat.

The spokesperson Sean Savett said that while “the specific text of the guidance is classified, its existence is in no way secret. “It is possible that we will one day look back and see the quarter-century after the cold war as nuclear intermission.”

Zhou argued that nuclear-armed states should declare a “no first use” policy, as so far only China and India have done.

On Tuesday, the Times reported that two senior administration officials had earlier been permitted to allude to the revision in US nuclear strategy without disclosing its existence.

In June, Pranay Vaddi, a senior director of the national security council, [warned](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/17/row-as-nato-chief-hints-at-talks-to-increase-availability-of-nuclear-weapons)
 that “absent a change” in nuclear strategy by China and Russia, the US was prepared to shift from modernisation of existing weapons to expanding its arsenal.

Vaddi also alluded to the highly classified document, saying it emphasised “the need to deter Russia, the PRC \[People’s Republic of China\] and [North Korea](https://www.theguardian.com/world/north-korea)
 simultaneously”.

The last major nuclear arms control agreement with Russia, [New Start](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/31/us-russia-new-start-nuclear-arms-treaty)
, which sets limits on intercontinental-range nuclear weapons, expires in early 2026 with no subsequent agreement in place.

China and Russia are now more politically and economically [aligned](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/23/a-return-to-the-cold-war-putin-and-kim-have-joined-forces-as-global-delinquents)
. But China’s arsenal is thought to be expanding at a much faster pace than any other country’s.

The US-based Arms Control Association said it understood US nuclear weapons strategy and posture remained the same as described in the administration’s 2022 nuclear posture review, and there had been no reorientation away from [Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia)
 and toward China.

Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association, said that while US intelligence estimates suggested China might increase the size of its nuclear arsenal from 500 to 1,000 warheads by 2030, Russia currently had about 4,000 nuclear warheads “and it remains the major driver behind US nuclear strategy”.

Biden approved the revised strategy – called the nuclear employment guidance – in March, according to the Times, but an unclassified notification of the policy change has not yet been presented to Congress.

After years of nuclear arms reduction efforts, the administration has been signalling willingness to expand the US arsenal to counter China and Russia’s nuclear strategies more recently. Last month, Chinese and Russian long-range bombers patrolled together near Alaska for the first time and held live-fire exercises in the South China Sea.

The second US administration official permitted to refer to the document, Vipin Narang, an MIT nuclear strategist who served in the Pentagon, said earlier this month that Biden had “issued updated nuclear weapons employment guidance to account for multiple nuclear-armed adversaries” and for “the significant increase in the size and diversity” of China’s nuclear arsenal.

“It is our responsibility to see the world as it is, not as we hoped or wished it would be,” the Times quoted Narang as saying. [Skip to main content](#maincontent)

, has [threatened](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/21/russia-begins-tactical-nuclear-weapon-drills-near-ukraine-border)
 to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine.

China’s foreign ministry on Wednesday said that it was “seriously concerned” by the reports and accused the US of “stirring up the so-called ‘China nuclear threat theory’”. In February, the US [warned](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/feb/14/mike-turner-national-security-threat)
 allies that Russia could be planning to put a nuclear weapon into space.

On Tuesday, a retired senior colonel in the Chinese People’s Liberation Army, Zhou Bo, [published a piece](https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/08/20/nuclear-weapons-war-no-first-use-policy/)
 in Foreign Policy arguing that the US and China could still cooperate on nuclear diplomacy."

Cooperation Between China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia: Current and Potential Future Threats to America
=========================================================================================================

Each one of these states threatens U.S. To make matters worse, China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea are increasing their support for one another. How likely is this scenario?

This paper examines the state of cooperation between China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea, and identifies paths that could lead to their closer cooperation—and paths that would not. A concluding section draws policy implications.

### **Cooperation in Pairs So Far**

Although China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea are now often viewed as an aligned group, cooperation among them has been almost entirely bilateral so far. Security Council resolution banning the practice.29 A few years ago, Pyongyang was estimated to receive $500 million annually this way, which it spends on its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.30 China also illicitly facilitates the export of millions of barrels of oil to North Korea through ship-to-ship transfers.31

While China’s support lessens the economic pressure that international sanctions put on Pyongyang, China’s security commitment is essential for it.32 Beijing also defends North Korea in international forums, vetoing resolutions that would tighten sanctions, and sometimes introducing measures to loosen them.33

There are limits, however, to cooperation in this dyad. For example, China has to date refused to provide North Korea with nuclear-weapons technology and expertise, and it has supported some sanctions targeting Pyongyang’s nuclear program.34 Some analysts even concluded that North Korea carried out its ballistic missile test close to Japan in 2022 to demonstrate that it had the long-range capacity to strike areas of value to Beijing.35

Mostly, China must manage the risk of disaster in North Korea."

US shifts nuclear focus to counter China’s growing arsenal
==========================================================

[Amrita Jash](/the-interpreter/contributors/articles/amrita-jash)

Beijing’s nuclear modernisation means its intentions and commitments to non-proliferation will continue to be questioned.

Listen to this article

[_The New York Times_](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/us/politics/biden-nuclear-china-russia.html?unlocked_article_code=1.EU4.WlFr.MEPeOr7CqMnA&smid=url-share)
 has reported that in March, US President Joe Biden approved a highly classified nuclear strategic plan for the United States. The paper goes on to say that for the first time, America’s deterrent strategy has reoriented to focus on China’s rapid expansion in its nuclear arsenal, as it also seeks to prepare for possible coordinated nuclear challenges from China, Russia and North Korea.

This shift in Washington’s policy comes after a Pentagon assessment that over the next decade China’s nuclear arsenal stockpiles will rival the size and diversity of those in the United States and Russia. It has been accused of transferring nuclear and missile technology to proliferators such as Pakistan, North Korea, and Iran, leading the Biden administration to [impose stricter export controls](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-tightens-export-controls-nuclear-power-items-china-2023-08-18/)
 on nuclear materials and technology to China.

These developments underscore that as China’s economic and military power continues to grow, its approach to non-proliferation will likely shape the international security landscape for years to come. The Russia-Ukraine war has only reinforced this idea.

This modernisation also puts a spotlight on China’s commitment to nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation norms.

Without economic incentives or offering entree to the White House, South Korea could find itself sidelined in North Korea diplomacy. In its [Annual Report to Congress](https://media.defense.gov/2023/Oct/19/2003323409/-1/-1/1/2023-MILITARY-AND-SECURITY-DEVELOPMENTS-INVOLVING-THE-PEOPLES-REPUBLIC-OF-CHINA.PDF)
 last year, the US Department of Defence highlighted two key aspects of China’s nuclear capabilities: First, that China has more than 500 active nuclear weapons, exceeding earlier estimates of 400 warheads, and following [earlier assessments](https://media.defense.gov/2022/Nov/29/2003122279/-1/-1/1/2022-Military-AndSecurity-Developments-Involving-The-Peoples-Republic-Of-China.pdf)
 is expected to have a stockpile of about 1,500 warheads by 2035; and second, that in keeping with its modernisation objectives, China is expected to have more than 1,000 operable nuclear weapons by 2030, many of which will probably be “deployed at higher readiness levels”.

A White House spokesperson was careful to say the new plan was “not a response to any single entity, country, nor threat” and that the guidance provided, while secret, was in keeping with actions taken by earlier administrations.

Beijing, however, raised “grave concerns” over the reported plan, with [China’s Foreign Ministry](https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/xw/fyrbt/202408/t20240821_11477550.html)
 declaring “the US has called China a ‘nuclear threat’ and used it as a convenient pretext to shirk its obligation of nuclear disarmament, expand its own nuclear arsenal, and seek absolute strategic predominance.”

China has restated its “no first use” policy, saying it has “no intention to engage in any form of arms race with other countries”, while accusing the United States of being “the primary source of nuclear threats and strategic risks in the world”. Beijing said Washington would be better to make “drastic and substantive cuts to its nuclear arsenal”, and to stop “nuclear sharing” and other “negative moves that undermine global and regional peace and stability”.

As China’s economic and military power continues to grow, its approach to non-proliferation will likely shape the international security landscape for years to come.

Of the nine nuclear-armed powers, China has one of the fastest-growing nuclear arsenals at present. So, to state that China seeks to have parity with the United States or Russia cannot be blithely dismissed. Any increase in China’s nuclear stockpile raises serious concerns, given the opaque nature of the country’s nuclear capabilities and its modernisation ambitions. China’s intentions continue to be guided by Deng Xiaoping’s observations that nuclear force enhancements were necessary “[to earn more say and a higher international status in a coming world order](https://www.academia.edu/23440377/The_Power_of_Prestige_Chinas_Nuclear_Developments_The_Power_of_Prestige_Chinas_Nuclear_Developments)
