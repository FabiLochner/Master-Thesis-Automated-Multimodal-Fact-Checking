## Elaboration
The claim is false. Multiple sources, including a Yahoo News article fact-checked by Snopes, debunk the claim. Zelenskyy's asset declaration shows fewer than 15 properties, no private planes, and an annual income of around $300,000. The declaration listed one overseas bank account holding around $377,000. There is no trace of a $35 million Florida mansion in Zelenskyy's name.

The Times of India states that Zelenskyy's real estate portfolio is worth $4 million and includes two wholly owned apartments, two co-owned apartments, a commercial property, and five parking spaces. An AOL article states that Zelenskyy's net worth is roughly $1.5 million, and his annual salary as president is approximately $11,200.


## Final Judgement
The evidence from multiple sources, including fact-checks by Snopes and reports from reputable news outlets, contradicts the claim. These sources indicate that Zelenskyy's assets and income are significantly less than what is stated in the claim. Therefore, the claim is demonstrably false.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim that Volodymyr Zelenskyy owns 15 homes, a $35 million home in Florida, has $1.2 billion in an overseas bank account, three private planes, and a monthly income of $11 million is false. Fact-checks by Snopes and reports from sources like Yahoo News ([https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-facts-behind-resurfaced-231800640.html](https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-facts-behind-resurfaced-231800640.html)) and The Times of India ([https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/etimes/trending/net-worth-of-volodymyr-zelenskyy-the-entertainer-turned-president-of-ukraine/articleshow/118651819.cms](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/etimes/trending/net-worth-of-volodymyr-zelenskyy-the-entertainer-turned-president-of-ukraine/articleshow/118651819.cms)) show that his actual assets and income are significantly lower.
