## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Russia Matters article from February 26, 2025, estimates that over 700,000 Russian soldiers have been killed or injured, with an additional 48,000 missing (![image 1](media/0.jpg)). The Wikipedia article on casualties of the Russo-Ukrainian War states that as of early June 2024, Russia claimed 6,465 Ukrainian soldiers were still held prisoner in Russia. By August 2024, the daily average of Russian military casualties was about 1,000 soldiers. In July 2024, it was estimated that Russia would need 1.5 to 1.8 million casualties to control four regions. As of July 29, 2025, 5,432 Russian officers had been killed.

The Mediazona article, updated on August 1, 2025, in collaboration with BBC News Russian service, provides information on Russian losses, with the last update of the Probate Registry estimate on February 24, 2025, as of December 2024. By November 2024, the number of losses among prisoners dropped to between 2â€“3%.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the claim is likely false. The Russia Matters article from February 26, 2025, estimates over 700,000 Russian soldiers killed or injured, with an additional 48,000 missing. While this is a substantial number, it does not reach the 1.5 million figure stated in the claim. The evidence also provides other casualty figures, but none support the claim's specific number.


## Final Judgement
The evidence suggests that the claim of 1.5 million Russian troop losses by February 2025 is not supported by the available data. While there are significant casualties, the provided sources estimate lower figures.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While the Russia Matters article from February 26, 2025, estimates over 700,000 Russian soldiers killed or injured, with an additional 48,000 missing, this figure does not align with the 1.5 million troop loss stated in the claim. Other sources also provide casualty figures, but none support the claim's specific number.
