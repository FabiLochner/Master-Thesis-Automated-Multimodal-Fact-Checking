## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Council on Foreign Relations ([https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-us-aid-going-ukraine](https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-us-aid-going-ukraine)) states that Ukraine is the top recipient of U.S. aid since the Russian invasion in February 2022. The article mentions a $20 billion loan in late 2024 and a freeze on military aid by President Trump in early March 2025. NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2025/08/05/g-s1-81084/europe-us-weapons-ukraine-russia-war](https://www.npr.org/2025/08/05/g-s1-81084/europe-us-weapons-ukraine-russia-war)) reported on August 5, 2025, that the U.S. has provided around $75 billion in military assistance since the full-scale invasion in 2022. ![image 496](media/2025-08-06_17-42-1754502173-562939.jpg), ![image 497](media/2025-08-06_17-42-1754502174-952586.jpg)

CSIS.org ([https://www.csis.org/analysis/trump-administration-boosts-immediate-military-aid-deliveries-ukraine](https://www.csis.org/analysis/trump-administration-boosts-immediate-military-aid-deliveries-ukraine)), published on February 11, 2025, discusses the Trump administration's military aid, including $652 million in weapons sales and the continuation of aid committed under the Biden administration, totaling around $30 billion over three-and-a-half years. ![image 503](media/2025-08-06_17-43-1754502186-411462.jpg), ![image 502](media/2025-08-06_17-43-1754502185-652269.jpg), ![image 501](media/2025-08-06_17-43-1754502184-885543.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the claim is inaccurate. The NPR article from August 5, 2025, states that the U.S. provided around $75 billion in military assistance since the full-scale invasion in 2022. The CSIS article from February 11, 2025, mentions a total of around $30 billion over three-and-a-half years. The claim of $350 billion is significantly higher than the amounts mentioned in the provided sources.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that the claim of $350 billion in military aid to Ukraine by February 2025 is not supported by the provided sources. The actual figures are much lower, with one source mentioning around $75 billion by August 2025 and another around $30 billion over a period of time. Therefore, the claim is demonstrably false. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is demonstrably false. According to a [NPR article](https://www.npr.org/2025/08/05/g-s1-81084/europe-us-weapons-ukraine-russia-war), the U.S. provided around $75 billion in military assistance by August 2025, and a [CSIS article](https://www.csis.org/analysis/trump-administration-boosts-immediate-military-aid-deliveries-ukraine) mentions around $30 billion over three-and-a-half years, which is significantly less than the claimed $350 billion.
