Useful result: From [Source](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/least-six-wounded-large-scale-russian-air-attack-ukraine-ukrainian-authorities-2025-06-29/): 
Content: The search result from Reuters, published on June 29, 2025, reports that a Ukrainian F-16 fighter pilot died in a crash while repelling a Russian air attack. The article mentions that Ukraine has lost three F-16s since it began operating the U.S.-made jets last year. <image:2735>

Useful result: From [Source](https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukraine-loses-16-fighter-amid-massed-russian-drone/story?id=123315001): 
Content: The ABC News article, published on June 29, 2025, reports that a Ukrainian F-16 fighter jet was lost during an attempt to repel a Russian attack. The pilot, Maksym Ustimenko, shot down seven targets before his F-16 was damaged. <image:2741> shows a Ukrainian F-16 in flight. <image:2736> shows firefighters working at a site of a Russian attack.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/6/29/ukrainian-pilot-killed-repelling-massive-russian-air-attack-overnight): 
Content: Al Jazeera reports that a Ukrainian F-16 aircraft was lost after repelling a Russian missile and drone strike on June 29, 2025. <image:0> The pilot, Lieutenant Colonel Maksym Ustimenko, died in the incident. The article also mentions that Russia launched 537 projectiles against Ukraine.

The claim '<image:22> This image shows a Ukrainian F-16 fighter jet which was shot down by Russia as part of the large-scale Russian invasion in Ukraine.' is misleading.
Justification: The image in the claim depicts an F-16 that crashed in a warehouse in 2019 due to mechanical failure, not a Ukrainian F-16 shot down by Russia. While Ukraine has lost F-16s recently, the image is unrelated to those events, making the claim misleading ([https://www.sbsun.com/2020/04/23/hydraulic-failure-caused-f-16-to-crash-near-march-base-last-year-air-force-says/](https://www.sbsun.com/2020/04/23/hydraulic-failure-caused-f-16-to-crash-near-march-base-last-year-air-force-says/)).

So, the overall veracity is: misleading
