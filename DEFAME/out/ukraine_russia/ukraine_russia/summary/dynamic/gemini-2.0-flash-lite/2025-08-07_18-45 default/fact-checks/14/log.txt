Useful result: From [Source](https://gwaramedia.com/en/debunking-russian-fakes-no-fox-news-didnt-write-about-ukraines-center-for-information-operations-receiving-140m-per-month-from-the-usaid/): 
Content: The article from gwaramedia.com debunks a claim that Fox News published an article stating that the "Psychological and Information Warfare Center of Ukraine" received $140,000,000 per month from USAID. The article states that the article was not found on the Fox News website and that the author, Aubrie Spady, did not publish any articles on February 10, 2025, mentioning the Ukrainian center. The article also mentions that the Telegram channel "Медведь" spread the disinformation. <image:1806>, <image:1809>, <image:1805>, <image:1804>, <image:1808>, <image:1807>. The article was published on February 27, 2025.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-disinformation-spikes-after-trump-zelenskyy-row/a-71832118): 
Content: The DW article fact-checks a claim that a Fox News article reported that USAID pays $140 million per month to Ukraine's Psychological and Information Warfare Center. The article states that a manipulated screenshot of an alleged Fox News article has been circulating on social media. The article states that USAID's share was approximately $39.9 billion, with the bulk allocated to humanitarian aid, governance programs, and public service support. The article states that there was no mention of a $140-million-per-month disbursement to a "Psychological and Information Warfare Center." The article also mentions that the "psychological operations unit" is part of its Special Operations Forces (SOF). <image:11>

Useful result: From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/72nd_Psychological_and_Information_Warfare_Center_(Ukraine)): 
Content: The Wikipedia article discusses the 72nd Psychological and Information Warfare Center, a unit of the Ukrainian Special Operations Forces concerned with psychological and informational warfare. It was established in 2003 and is currently headquartered in Kyiv. The center has been involved in the Russo-Ukrainian War and the Syrian Civil War. The article also mentions the center's structure, commanders, and history, including its capture by Russian forces in Crimea in 2014. <image:11>

The claim '<image:11> This image shows a screenshot of an authentic Fox News article with the title 'Psychological and Information Warfare Center of Ukraine received $140,000,000 per month from USAID'.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. The image is a manipulated screenshot of a purported Fox News article that did not exist. The article was not found on the Fox News website, and the author, Aubrie Spady, did not publish any articles on February 10, 2025, mentioning the Ukrainian center, as confirmed by multiple sources, including [gwaramedia.com](https://gwaramedia.com/en/debunking-russian-fakes-no-fox-news-didnt-write-about-ukraines-center-for-information-operations-receiving-140m-per-month-from-the-usaid/) and [dw.com](https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-disinformation-spikes-after-trump-zelenskyy-row/a-71832118).

So, the overall veracity is: false
