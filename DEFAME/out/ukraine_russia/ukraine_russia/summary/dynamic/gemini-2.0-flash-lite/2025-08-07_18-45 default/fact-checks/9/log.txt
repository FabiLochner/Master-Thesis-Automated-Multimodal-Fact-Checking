Useful result: From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kursk_campaign): 
Content: The Wikipedia article discusses the 2024 Kursk offensive, which began on August 6, 2024, during the Russo-Ukrainian War. The Armed Forces of Ukraine launched an incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast, leading to clashes with Russian forces. A state of emergency was declared, and Russian reserves were deployed. By the end of the first week, Ukraine claimed to have captured 1,000 km2 of Russian territory, while Russia acknowledged the capture of 28 settlements. The front stabilized in the second half of August, and the Ukrainian advance stalled in early October. North Korean forces were sent to the province from November to support the Russian military. The article also includes information on the commanders, units involved, and casualties. <image:7> is not mentioned.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2025/04/27/zelensky-says-ukraine-still-fighting-in-russias-kursk-a88884): 
Content: The Moscow Times reports on the ongoing conflict in the Kursk region, mentioning a Ukrainian offensive in August 2024. The article includes a statement from Zelensky about the situation in Kursk. The article also mentions a meeting between Zelensky and Donald Trump. The article also includes several images related to the conflict in the Kursk region. <image:1718>, <image:1719>, <image:1714>, <image:1716>, <image:1717>.

The claim '<image:7> This image shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky arriving in August 2024 in the Sudzha of Kursk region, Russia, which had just been occupied by Ukrainian troops in the Kursk Offensive, and meeting with representatives of the people there.' is misleading.
Justification: The image in the claim, which shows Volodymyr Zelensky, was taken in May 2022 during a visit to the Kharkiv region, as reported by the BBC ([https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-europe-61612803](https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-europe-61612803)) and Telegrafi.com. The claim incorrectly states that the image was taken in August 2024 in the Kursk region.

So, the overall veracity is: misleading
