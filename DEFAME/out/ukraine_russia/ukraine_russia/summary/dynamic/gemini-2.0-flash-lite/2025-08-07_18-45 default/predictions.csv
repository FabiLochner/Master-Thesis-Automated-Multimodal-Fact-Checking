The UK poured hundreds of millions of pounds into Zelensky's crushing failure'.",FALSE,FALSE,"The claim is false. While the Hull Daily Mail did publish an edition on March 13, 2025, the front page image is fabricated.

",True,"But the supposed Hull Daily Mail headline blasting Zelensky over the Kursk incursion is a fabrication.
""That story re Ukraine was a fake,"" said Lija Kresowaty, a spokesperson for Reach PLC, the Hull Daily Mail's parent company, in a March 18 email."

Fact-checks from aol.com and cedmohub.eu ([cedmohub.eu](https://www.cedmohub.eu/en/news/did-zelenskyy-buy-the-eagles-nest-in-bavaria/)) confirm that the Eagle's Nest is still owned by the Free State of Bavaria.
",True,"The Eagle's Nest is in the property of the state of Bavaria. The administration of state-owned real estate is the responsibility of IMBY, which is listed in the alleged purchase agreement. On February 7, 2025, the company posted a press release on its website in which it called the claim ""deliberate misinformation"". The Eagle's Nest ""continues to be owned by the Free State of Bavaria"", the state-owned company stated. It said that a sale had neither taken place nor was planned. IMBY also addressed details from the video: ""The alleged purchase agreement shown in the video is a forgery, and the same applies to the alleged quote from IMBY's management"". It will also take legal action against the misinformation."
2,In February 2025 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy blocked access to US President Donald Trump's social media platform Truth Social across Ukraine.,FALSE,FALSE,"The evidence indicates that Donald Trump used Truth Social to criticize Volodymyr Zelenskyy in March 2025, and there is no mention of Zelenskyy blocking access to Truth Social in Ukraine. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the provided evidence.
",True,"A spokesperson for Trump Media and Technology Group, which owns Truth Social, said the company has not launched the micro-blogging site in Ukraine.
""Reports that Truth Social was blocked in Ukraine are false -- Truth Social has never been available in Ukraine,"" the spokesperson said in a February 20 email.
After the claims about Zelensky banning Truth Social began circulating on social media, a spokesperson for Ukraine's foreign ministry posted on X, saying state officials had not banned the platform because it is ""unfortunately"" not available in the country (archived here).
""We would appreciate it if the Truth Social would add Ukraine to their authorized region of operations,"" foreign ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi said on February 20."

Multiple fact-checking sources, including Ukrinform.net, PesaCheck, and AAP FactCheck, confirm the image's inauthenticity, highlighting that the actual cover from November 16, 2024, featured a different image and that the fake cover contains spelling errors and was promoted by a pro-Kremlin Telegram channel.
",True,"However, The Economist does list Telegram among its social media channels -- and its website does not show any November 2024 covers similar to the one posted online (archived here)."

Multiple sources, including the Ukrainian military, have debunked the claim that the image shows the coffins of 18 British Special Forces killed in the Odessa region in Ukraine. The claim originated from a Dutch journalist, Sonja van den Ende, and has been widely refuted ([https://www.uawire.org/false-allegations-of-british-sas-casualties-in-odesa-dutch-journalist-s-controversial-claims-debunked-by-ukrainian-military](https://www.uawire.org/false-allegations-of-british-sas-casualties-in-odesa-dutch-journalist-s-controversial-claims-debunked-by-ukrainian-military)).

The claim is therefore misleading.
",False,"While a US-made F-16 -- supplied to Ukraine by its Western allies -- crashed during a combat mission in August 2024, the image shows a Russian MiG-29 that collided with another aircraft during an airshow on July 24, 1993."
7,BlackRock has asked that Ukrainian soldiers not be buried on the land it owns in Ukraine.,FALSE,FALSE,"The claim that BlackRock requested Ukrainian soldiers not be buried on its land is false.

",True,"However, a representative for BlackRock said the claim was baseless.
""This is completely false,"" the spokesperson told AFP on August 22. ""BlackRock Inc. does not own any land in Ukraine.""
A spokesperson for the land committee of the Ukrainian Agribusiness Club (UCAB) told AFP on the same day: ""We haven't heard about anything like that.""
Frederic Mousseau, policy director at the US-based Oakland Institute think tank -- which has published reports on agricultral land reform in Ukraine -- confirmed BlackRock does not own land in the country, although it does hold other Ukrainian assets (archived link).
""According to our research over large land leases in Ukraine presented in our report; 'War and Theft, the Takeover of Ukraine's Agricultural Land', BlackRock doesn't own any land in Ukraine"", he told AFP on August 22 (archived link).
Agricultural land privatisation began in Ukraine in 2021, Mousseau said, potentially providing indirect exposure to land assets, but no single investor could reach 47 percent of the country's total land mass in this way.
Foreigners are not permitted to buy agricultural land in Ukraine and can only buy non-agricultural land if they meet certain legal conditions, according to the Land Code of Ukraine (archived link).
""BlackRock owns part of Ukraine's debt through Eurobonds, which gives the company leverage over the country,"" Mousseau added.
""Ukraine has been forced by creditors to undertake an ongoing drastic structural adjustment program aiming at privatise all sectors of its economy."""

The claim incorrectly states that the image was taken in August 2024 in the Kursk region.
",False,"A reverse image search and subsequent keyword searches on Google found the same photo -- distributed by the Ukrainian presidential office -- published in AFP's archives on May 29, 2022.

According to Detector Media, the toys are authentic and can be seen in other photos and videos from the scene.
",True,"Hany Farid, a digital forensics expert at the University of California-Berkeley (archived here), told AFP in a July 12 email that the photo shows ""no evidence of digital manipulation or editing.""
He said the Ukrainian government's use of the camera's original RAW file further suggests it ""is not fake or manipulated."" RAW files retain all of the data from the camera's sensor, without any automatic retouching to the image.
Farid said a model trained to distinguish real pictures from those created by artificial intelligence uncovered no signs of AI generation, either. But he added that he could not rule out whether the toys had been propped up or otherwise staged for dramatic effect.
Matthew Stamm, head of Drexel University's Multimedia and Information Security Lab (archived here), said July 13 that he also ""found no evidence of manipulation."""
11,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's wife bought a $5,000,000.00 Bugatti while vacationing in Paris.",FALSE,FALSE,"The claim is false. Multiple news outlets, including the BBC ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c72ver6172do](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c72ver6172do)), reported that the story originated from a deepfake video and was part of a disinformation campaign. Bugatti Paris denied the transaction.
",True,"The main piece of evidence in the posts is a photo of an invoice with the Bugatti logo.
The document indicates Zelenska should receive the luxury car in 2026. The invoice also says the price is 4,462,400, but it does not specify any currency.
Car Lovers, the firm that owns the Bugatti dealership in Paris, called the document ""fake news"" in a July 2 press release (archived here).
""The Car Lovers group vehemently denies both that this transaction took place and, therefore, that this invoice exists,"" the company said.
""Not only do the mandatory legal notices not appear on the invoice, but the price of the vehicle is also wrong, the price of the options and their description are inexact and incoherent, the visual corporate identity is outdated and the Car Lovers group would never have allowed such a document to be issued.""
The dealership address is misspelled on the invoice, with an ""l"" missing in ""Neuilly-sur-Seine."" The document also lacks mandatory information, such as the applicable value-added tax (VAT), and shows a number used in the Australian banking system but not in France."

While the summit did occur and was attended by several leaders, including Zelenskyy, Starmer, and Macron, the provided evidence, including image and web searches, does not mention or depict leaders removing their suits.
",False,"World leaders gathered for a group photo at a summit in London did not remove their jackets in solidarity with Ukraine, and an image shared online appearing to show them doing so has been manipulated."

After the invasion, Zelenskyy stopped wearing suits publicly, making the claim misleading.
",True,"The photo of a suited Zelenskiy shaking Klaus Schwab’s hand is from January 2020, two years before Russia invaded Ukraine.
A photo of a suit-wearing Volodymyr Zelenskiy shaking hands with the World Economic Forum’s founder has been presented online as evidence of double-standards by the Ukrainian president, though online discourse omits context that the photo is from years before Zelenskiy adopted more simple, military-style attire in solidarity with his citizens at war with Russia."

",True,"However, a poll, carried out by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology, opens new tab (KIIS) found 63% of Ukrainian respondents approved of Zelenskiy, up from 56% in May 2024.
The White House, contacted by Reuters, declined to comment.
The latest poll, part of a project funded by The British Academy, surveyed 1,600 people between November 2024 and January 2025. Asked whether they approve or disapprove of Zelenskiy's actions as president, 26.1% of respondents said they “completely approve” and 36.9% said they “tend to approve”.
Another KIIS survey, carried out from February 4-9 this year, found 57% of Ukrainians trust Zelenskiy. The poll showed 37% of respondents do not trust him.
Anton Hrushetskyi, director of KIIS, told Reuters that while similar, trust and approval are not identical concepts. He said a person can approve of someone's activities, but that does not necessarily mean that they trust them.
Olga Onuch, a professor in comparative and Ukrainian politics at the University of Manchester who worked with KIIS to produce the surveys, said in a statement on Wednesday, opens new tab: “Trump’s claim is not only factually incorrect, but also irresponsible and anti-democratic - Zelenskiy remains a fairly popular political leader in Ukraine. Spreading misinformation about his legitimacy directly aids Kremlin propaganda and undermines the Ukrainian people's right to determine their own future.”"

This statement aligns with the claim's sentiment about not discussing certain matters with Trump. The evidence also supports the context of the claim by mentioning Zelenskyy's intention to discuss NATO membership with Biden. However, the exact quote from the claim is not fully present in the evidence, but the sentiment is.
",True,"Zelenskiy told reporters at a joint press conference with German opposition leader Friedrich Merz on Dec. 9 that he hoped to call outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden in the coming days to discuss an invitation to the military alliance.
He did also say that he saw no reason to speak to Trump.
However, these comments presented alone lack important context, as Zelenskiy said he saw no reason to speak to Trump, because Trump was not yet the sitting president."
17,Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy purchased an 88 million euro hotel in the Courchevel ski resort in France.,FALSE,FALSE,"The claim that Volodymyr Zelenskyy purchased an 88 million euro hotel in Courchevel is false.

",False,"A Russian man was jailed for 14 years in November for state treason, not for burning a copy of the Koran, contrary to online claims.

",False,"Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said at the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro that she understood the U.S. decision to approve Ukraine using its weapons in Russia, but her comments have been misleadingly represented online as a condemnation."

",True,"Mexican President-elect Claudia Sheinbaum said on Sept. 17 that she did not immediately plan to visit Ukraine, citing her prioritization of domestic issues and Mexico’s principle of non-interference in foreign affairs. She did not call Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy a drug addict, contrary to a fabricated quote shared online."
22,<image:12> This image shows a chemical attack by the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the Kursk offensive in August 2024.,MISLEADING,MISLEADING,"The claim is misleading. While there are reports of a chemical attack during the Kursk offensive, the image's origin and the nature of the explosion are not confirmed. The geolocation data suggests the image was most likely taken in Palestine, Jordan, or Ukraine. The claim misrepresents the origin and content of the image.
",True,"The same scene can be seen at timestamp 00:09 of a March 2015 BBC News video titled “Islamic State's toxic ‘chlorine gas’ bombs.”
The clip, provided by Iraqi officials, shows orange smoke rising from a controlled explosion and Iraqi officials said there was evidence that Islamic State militants were using chlorine gas in roadside bombing in Iraq, the BBC reported. A photo taken by Reuters in March 2015 in a town north of the Iraqi capital Baghdad shows a chlorine-tinged cloud of smoke rising from a bomb detonated by Iraqi troops and Shi’ite forces."

",True,"It's possible to arrive at varying totals depending on how military aid is defined or by considering how much money was allocated — as opposed to actually paid out — by the U.S. government, but none of these totals amounts to $350 billion.
Trump's claim is incorrect. While it is possible to arrive at varying totals using different ways to categorize or count the financial figures, none amounts to $350 billion. As of this writing, the United States had allocated nearly $183 billion for the response to Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, according to the U.S. government's inspector general overseeing the situation. That amount includes more than just what the U.S. government directly sent to Ukraine — and only $83 billion had actually been paid out as of December 2024. Thus, we rate this claim false."
24,Warren Buffett has given more than $500 million to Ukraine since 2022.,FALSE,MISLEADING,"The claim is misleading. While Howard Buffett, not Warren Buffett, has donated substantial aid to Ukraine, with his foundation providing at least $520 million, the evidence does not support the claim that Warren Buffett himself has donated over $500 million.

Vance, fought in the Russo-Ukrainian War from 2022 to 2025, as reported by [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nate_Vance) and the BBC, confirming the claim that he served for three years.

While we could not independently confirm that the claim was true, several reputable news organizations from various countries, including CNN and French newspaper Le Figaro (archived), all reported that Vance volunteered to fight in Ukraine and served alongside Ukrainian forces for three years, and provided sufficient photographic evidence."

",True,"Zelenskyy did say, ""The U.S. will have to send their sons and daughters exactly the same way as we are sending [our] sons and daughters to war."" However, he was talking about a hypothetical situation in which Ukraine losing the war against Russia would lead to a broader conflict resulting in Americans being pulled into fighting.

",True,"No link between Ukraine and Helene aid, and Joe Biden didn’t rule out future hurricane aid
In Sept. 29 remarks to reporters, President Joe Biden did not say no more aid would be provided for areas affected by Hurricane Helene. He also did not tie hurricane funding to Ukraine war funding; a Ukraine aid package Biden announced days earlier came from money Congress already appropriated.
Biden said all available resources were in place before the storm made landfall. A fact sheet detailed numerous steps the White House had taken, including issuing disaster and emergency declarations for affected states.

",False," Misbar reviewed Trump and Netanyahu’s full meeting, finding that the claim originated from a misinterpretation in Netanyahu’s statement about the situation in Gaza. After a reporter asked Trump whether the resettlement plans for Gaza were still on the agenda or not, Trump passed the question to Netanyahu, who said that Gaza is “closed in.” Netanyahu answered that people in other war zones, specifying Syria and Ukraine, had a choice to leave the country. Gaza, however, is the only place where people are locked in. He claimed Israel was not restricting them. Netanyahu then asked, “What is wrong with giving people a choice?” referring to the resettlement plans for Gazans."

The video, which included frames similar to the viral image, showed Zelenskyy visiting an ammunition factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania. According to AFP’s description, Zelenskyy visited the United States at the time to seek permission to use Western weapons against targets in Russia. At the 0:56 timestamp, a frame similar to the viral image can be seen."

A fact-check from aol.com explicitly states that Annalena Baerbock did not threaten to cut diplomatic ties with the United States in February 2025 ([https://www.aol.com/fact-check-germany-did-not-142747218.html](https://www.aol.com/fact-check-germany-did-not-142747218.html)). Instead, she urged European allies to pressure the US.
",True,"Germany’s Foreign Minister Criticized Europe’s Exclusion From U.S.-Russia Talks. The claim emerged after Germany’s Foreign Minister, Annalena Baerbock, criticized the exclusion of European countries from U.S.-Russia talks on the Ukrainian war, which were recently held in Saudi Arabia. Baerbock argued that lasting peace in Europe cannot be achieved without European involvement, warning that temporary peace would allow Russia to regroup for future conflicts. She also stated that downplaying Europe’s role would benefit Russia and called for greater confidence in dealing with the new U.S. administration."

",False,"Contrary to the viral claim, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz did not call for a state of emergency in Germany after Trump’s recent peace talks. A closer review of Scholz’s speech reveals that he referred to “Notlage,” not “Notstand” as claimed. In the video, Scholz said, “The Bundestag should pass a resolution as soon as possible according to which the war in Ukraine and its serious consequences for the security of Germany and Europe are classified as an emergency (Notlage) within the meaning of Article 115 paragraph two of the Basic Law.” In German, “Notstand” means a state of emergency that would severely restrict citizens’ rights. However, “Notlage” appears in the German Basic Law and signifies an urgent situation, but it does not equate to a government-imposed state of emergency.”"

However, Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform that he had a call with Putin on February 12, 2025, during which they discussed Ukraine, the Middle East, energy, artificial intelligence, and various other subjects. During the call, both presidents agreed to have their teams start negotiations immediately. Trump said he would call President Zelenskyy to inform him of their decision, which he planned to do while writing the post. Media outlets also reported that Ukraine talks would start, citing Trump’s post, but did not report that Trump had reached an agreement to end the war."
53,"As of February 2025, Russia has lost 1.5 million troops in the Ukraine war.",FALSE,FALSE,"The claim is false. While the Russia Matters article from February 26, 2025, estimates over 700,000 Russian soldiers killed or injured, with an additional 48,000 missing, this figure does not align with the 1.5 million troop loss stated in the claim. Other sources also provide casualty figures, but none support the claim's specific number.
",True,"For the benefit of the doubt, and as it wasn't explicit, Newsweek has treated the term ""lost"" to mean losses from those killed or injured. Trump said last month that 1.7 million soldiers across both sides had been killed, as reported by Politico, for which there is no evidence. Even though he went on to say that he was ""interested primarily from the standpoint of death,"" Newsweek assessed the total of wounded and killed. A November 2024 report by the French Institute of International Relations referenced British military intelligence that said that as of May 2024, Russia's killed and wounded was up to 500,000. Using data from other conflicts to estimate the amount of Russian irreversible losses (those killed, wounded who died in hospital, or otherwise immobilized), the report suggested total irreversible Russian casualties in Ukraine by mid-summer 2024 had reached around 460,000. In December 2024, the U.K. Minister for the Armed Forces, Luke Pollard MP, told the U.K. Parliament's House of Commons: ""Our assessments further indicate there have been over 750,000 Russian casualties since the beginning of the full-scale invasion with the grim milestone of one million Russians dead and wounded likely to be reached within approximately six months."" Global security experts at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) said in a report published this week that, as of early January 2025, it estimated a minimum of 172,000 Russian troops had been killed, with 611,000 wounded, of whom 376,000 were severely wounded. Recruitment since the start of the war had generated approximately 976,000 personnel, it said, adding that up to an accumulated 235,000 Russian wounded were ""recoverable."" Recent estimates published by Ukraine's military say that as of February 10, 2025, Russian casualties had reached 850,490. While larger, its total isn't far from independent experts and government reports, with recent Ukrainian analyses echoing experts outside Kyiv. For example, the IISS's estimate of 783,000 from early January 2025 was, by its own words, a ""minimum"" approximate and, as noted by defense-industry specialist magazine Defense Express, was roughly in line with the Ukrainian military estimate published in late December 2024 of 789,550."

A Newsweek analysis of similar claims made in 2022, the year the war began, reveals a coordinated effort by Russian disinformation networks to spread false narratives about Ukraine's handling of Western-supplied weapons. This effort has included fabricated dark web ads, with pro-Russian outlets circulating images of a supposed Javelin anti-tank weapon for sale online. However, the listing was traced back to pro-Russian Telegram channels, and the images themselves dated to 2014— preceding both the war and the current levels of U.S. military support."

In his French accent, Macron replied that he would never offer advice to Trump. He added that he ceased his discussions with Putin “after Bucha and the war crimes,” explaining that, at the time, Macron believed that France “had nothing to get from him.” In the press conference clip, published by several outlets including CTV News, the word “Bucha” is clearly audible in Macron’s French accent, not “butcher.”"
