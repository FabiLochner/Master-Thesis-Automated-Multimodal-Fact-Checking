Useful result: From [Source](https://www.peakpx.com/en/hd-wallpaper-desktop-oyvnm): Found exact image on website with title: Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-29S Fulcrum (925), Eject, Fulcrum, Russian ...
Content: The image is of a Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-29S Fulcrum (925) ejecting. The website provides various wallpapers of jet fighters, including the MiG-29, and other military aircraft. <image:5> is not an F-16.

Useful result: From [Source](https://factcheckkorea.afp.com/doc.afp.com.324U6AA): Found exact image on website with title: 이 사진은 1993년 영국 에어쇼 도중 발생한 사고를 촬영한 것이다
Content: The image is of a 1993 airshow accident in the UK, not a US F-16 shot down in 2024. The photo was taken by Carl Ford on July 24, 1993, and shows a collision of two Russian MiG-29 fighter jets. The article was published on March 11, 2022, by AFP Korea. <image:5>

The claim '<image:5> This image shows a US F-16 fighter jet which was shot down in August 2024 in airspace over the Black Sea after refusing to obey Russian orders.' is misleading.
Justification: The image in the claim depicts a Russian MiG-29, not a US F-16, and shows a mid-air collision during an airshow in 1993, not a shooting down in 2024. The claim is therefore misleading.

So, the overall veracity is: misleading
