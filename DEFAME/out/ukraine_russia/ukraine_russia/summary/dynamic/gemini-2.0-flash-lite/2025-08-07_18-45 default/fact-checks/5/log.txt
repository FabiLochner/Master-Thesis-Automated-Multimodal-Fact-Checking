Useful result: From [Source](https://simanaitissays.com/2024/10/15/yet-another-collector-car-for-zelensky/): 
Content: The article from simanaitissays.com, published on October 15, 2024, debunks a claim that Volodymyr Zelenskyy bought Hitler's parade car. The article references a fake news article and mentions that the image of the car was found across the internet. <image:1607>, <image:4>. The article also mentions that the Mercedes-Benz 770K had briefly appeared in the Seattle area in February 2018.

The claim '<image:4> This image shows Hitler's parade car which was bought by the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy for 15 Million US-$.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. Multiple sources, including [VOA News](https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-propagandists-push-fake-story-that-zelenskyy-bought-hitler-s-car/7818175.html) and [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2024/10/09/despite-online-claims-ukraines-zelensky-didnt-buy-hitlers-car/), debunk the story, indicating it originated from fake news. The car is currently owned by Australian billionaire Clive Palmer.
