The claim 'Russian President Vladimir Putin has died in an explosion in one of his limousines.' is false.
Justification: Multiple news sources, including the [Economic Times](https://m.economictimes.com/news/international/world-news/blast-in-one-of-vladimir-putins-official-limousines-triggers-fresh-assassination-concerns/articleshow/119758547.cms), [The Sun](https://www.thesun.co.uk/), and [Kyiv Post](https://www.kyivpost.com/post/49868), report an explosion involving one of Vladimir Putin's limousines. However, these reports do not confirm Putin's presence in the vehicle or his death.

So, the overall veracity is: false
