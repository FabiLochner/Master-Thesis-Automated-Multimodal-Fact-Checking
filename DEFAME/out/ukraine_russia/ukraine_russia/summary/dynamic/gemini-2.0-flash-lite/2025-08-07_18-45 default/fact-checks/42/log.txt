Content: DW.COM published a fact-check article on Donald Trump's claims regarding Ukraine and Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The article, edited by Rachel Baig, addresses several claims, including the amount of U.S. aid to Ukraine.

*   The article references the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology and the Ukraine Support Tracker (UST) by the Kiel Institute for the World Economy.
*   The article also mentions that a significant part of the aid consists of paying US soldiers to train Ukrainian troops, or in sending weapons, ammunition and other military equipment from US stocks.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.newsweek.com/trump-ukraine-fraud-probe-zelensky-2038142): 
Content: Newsweek published an article discussing a potential probe into the use of U.S. aid to Ukraine. The article mentions that Elon Musk's "Department of Government Efficiency" (DOGE) is looking into potential problems with the aid. The article also mentions that Zelensky denied there was a major problem with waste and fraud. The article was written by Peter Aitken and published in 2024. <image:2142>

The claim 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's statement in an AP news interview from February 1, 2025 that his country's military has received only a portion of the more than 175 billion in U.S. aid confirms that the US aid is a money laundering operation.' is not enough information.
Justification: The claim that Zelenskyy's statement confirms U.S. aid is a money laundering operation is not supported by the evidence. While Zelenskyy did state that Ukraine received a portion of the U.S. aid, and there were discussions about potential fraud and waste, there is no evidence to confirm the aid was a money laundering operation.

So, the overall veracity is: not enough information
