The claim '<image:18> This image shows an authentic list realeased by Ukraine showing US politicians taking bribes from Ukraine. The highest bribe was 92 Million US-$ for Joe Biden.' is misleading.
Justification: The claim is misleading. While there are discussions about corruption related to Ukraine and some US politicians, the provided evidence, including web and image searches, does not support the existence or authenticity of the list presented in the image. The search results mention corruption concerns and investigations related to Ukraine and some US politicians, but they do not provide any information about a list released by Ukraine detailing bribes.

So, the overall veracity is: misleading
