Content: Vanity Fair reports that a video claims USAID paid celebrities to visit Ukraine. The video, which has been circulating since February 5, alleges that USAID paid Angelina Jolie, Sean Penn, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Orlando Bloom, and Ben Stiller. Ben Stiller denied the claims, stating he self-funded his trip. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) confirmed that Ben Stiller is not compensated for his work with UNHCR and self-funds his travel. The video has been fabricated to appear as though it came from E!.

The claim 'E! News reported that the United States Agency Aid and Development (USAID) paid millions for celebrities to visit Ukraine.' is false.

Additionally, E! News' parent company, NBCUniversal, dismissed the claim.
