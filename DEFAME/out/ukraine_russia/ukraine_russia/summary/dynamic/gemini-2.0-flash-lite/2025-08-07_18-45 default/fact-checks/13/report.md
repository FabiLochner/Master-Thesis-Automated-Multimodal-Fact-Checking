## Claim
Claim: "![image 10](media/13.jpg) This image shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky wearing a suit after the large-scale Russian invasion in Ukraine: in a talk with Klaus Schwab at the World Economic Forum."

## Actions
```
web_search("Volodymyr Zelensky Klaus Schwab World Economic Forum")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The World Economic Forum published an article about Volodymyr Zelenskyy's meeting with leaders at the Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, from January 15â€“19, 2024. The article mentions Zelenskyy's call for business leaders to invest in Ukraine. The image (![image 10](media/13.jpg)) shows Zelenskyy at the World Economic Forum.

Another source states that the photo shows Zelenskyy and Schwab in suits in January 2020, before the Russian invasion of Ukraine. After the invasion, Zelenskyy stopped wearing suits publicly. (![image 1763](media/2025-08-07_19-06-1754593598-169511.jpg))


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests the claim is inaccurate. While the image does show Zelenskyy at the World Economic Forum, the evidence indicates the photo was taken in January 2020, before the large-scale Russian invasion. After the invasion, Zelenskyy stopped wearing suits publicly.


## Final Judgement
The image shows Zelenskyy and Schwab at the World Economic Forum. However, the photo was taken in January 2020, before the Russian invasion of Ukraine. After the invasion, Zelenskyy stopped wearing suits publicly. Therefore, the claim misrepresents the context of the image.

`misleading`


### Verdict: MISLEADING

### Justification
The image depicts Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Klaus Schwab at the World Economic Forum, but the photo was taken in January 2020, before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, as indicated by the evidence from the web search. After the invasion, Zelenskyy stopped wearing suits publicly, making the claim misleading.
