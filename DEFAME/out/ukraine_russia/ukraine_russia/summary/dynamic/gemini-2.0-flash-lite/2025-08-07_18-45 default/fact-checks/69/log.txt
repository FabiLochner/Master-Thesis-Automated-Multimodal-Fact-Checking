Useful result: From [Source](https://www.aol.com/fact-check-assad-passport-image-140122086.html): 
Content: The AOL article, published on January 8, 2025, fact-checks an image of a passport claimed to belong to Bashar al-Assad. The article states that the image is fake and has been photoshopped. The original passport image was found on Wikipedia. <image:2651>

Content: The Wikipedia article discusses the Syrian civil war, including the fall of the Assad regime in 2024. It mentions Bashar al-Assad's birthdate (September 11, 1965) and his family.

Useful result: From [Source](https://english.nv.ua/nation/relatives-of-bashar-al-assad-arrested-at-beirut-airport-using-fake-passports-50477670.html): 
Content: The article from NV.ua discusses the arrest of relatives of Bashar al-Assad at Beirut airport on December 28, who were attempting to leave using fake passports. The article also mentions that Bashar al-Assad's regime collapsed and he fled to Moscow. <image:2674>
