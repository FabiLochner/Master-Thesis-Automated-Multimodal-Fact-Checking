The claim '<image:3> This image shows the coffins of 18 British Special Forces who were killed in November 2024 in the Odessa Region in Ukraine.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. Multiple sources, including the Ukrainian military, have debunked the claim that the image shows the coffins of 18 British Special Forces killed in the Odessa region in Ukraine. The claim originated from a Dutch journalist, Sonja van den Ende, and has been widely refuted ([https://www.uawire.org/false-allegations-of-british-sas-casualties-in-odesa-dutch-journalist-s-controversial-claims-debunked-by-ukrainian-military](https://www.uawire.org/false-allegations-of-british-sas-casualties-in-odesa-dutch-journalist-s-controversial-claims-debunked-by-ukrainian-military)).

So, the overall veracity is: false
