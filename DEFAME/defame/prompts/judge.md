**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.
3. Provide your 2 best guesses for the claim's veracity and the probability that each is correct (0% to 100%). List them in order of probability scores, with the most likely option first.
